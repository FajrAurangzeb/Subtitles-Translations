00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,910
'Kaiser Villa'

3
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,471
Jeez...

4
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,363
It's 7 already...

5
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,020
And I've got an exam today... The teacher's gonna eat me alive if I failed again...

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,740
Look alive, Meenu!

7
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,510
Aye, I heard you!

8
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,040
'Kaiser House'

9
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,710
Me fella... Me dear lad... Me sweet wee young paddy!

10
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,506
All that sweetness is gonna give me diabetes...

11
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,970
But yer are me sweet wee lad!
-Don't call me 'sweet'.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,710
Gie me a break! Oi canny fib!

13
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,955
Anyway, what is it?

14
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:02,990
Don't let that old hag know we're going to meet a potential match for you tomorrow.

15
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,240
But she's our Mam-gu too!
-She's my co-wife! That's all you should know!

16
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,050
Grandpa's no more! It'd be better if you two got over this blood feud!
-Gie me a break! I'll get you some tea, sweetie...

17
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,730
Blimey, Granny, be done with it already... You'll push everything I've learnt out of my head!

18
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:30,350
Oh I'm gonna have proper fun today. Come 'ere. I'm gonna slice and rats and mice your Granny Bakhto before I skewer 'er and char 'er proper! If you got a job today, my lad, I tell you!

19
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,850
Please don't say that. She's our Granny too!

20
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,931
Like the devil she is! That cow became my co-wife a month after my marriage!

21
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:42,320
Well, Grandpa's fault! He lost his heart to her!

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,640
God bless your Grandpa... Although I doubt he deserves it one bit...

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,870
Kaiser thought he was some blasted king for real, who could get away with two marriages!

24
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:01,330
Gotta say he treated you equally though. Equally majestic villas, equal number of kids, equal shares in the business... How very... Saintly of him!

25
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,200
Oh, put a sock in it... Daan't get me started! Just focus on your interview.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,010
It's tomorrow.

27
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:17,710
Whatever. Na get aahhht of 'ere quietly before your ovver Granny sees ya. That Gooseberry Puddin' can clock through walls, she can!

28
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,910
Okay... That's enough oiling for one day!

29
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,709
Scapa Fla wake aw them loungers up! We ain't gonna wait until Jim Skinner for them!
-Okay...

30
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,168
Here!

31
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,453
Yes! Here it is!

32
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,780
Yeah!
-Shh!

33
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,960
That's mine!

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,130
Gimme my share quietly or there will be blood!
-Ya daan't say!

35
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,490
We'll divide it on the way.
-Hurry up, Walid! Before someone sees you!

36
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,003
Quit mumbling, Mumbo!
-Double time!

37
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,112
Jesus... Hadi's here!

38
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,248
Quick!

39
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,855
Wonder what our Three Idiots are doing in Uncle's room...
-Asking for our pocket money...?

40
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:38,152
Except Uncle's waiting for you at breakfast.
-Really? Let's not keep him waiting for Godot, then, Meenu!

41
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:42,783
'Waiting for Godot'? And I thought someone was failing in English...

42
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,268
Out!

43
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,039
See ya!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like anyone, sweetie?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no choice.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about your sisters. Tell me the kind you like.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bookworm. A lover of literature...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As nice and cultured as they get!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm, composed, sober, and graceful.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess I'll have to look in a NASA library...
