OST

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Breakfast is ready, Miss Annie.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a moment, Asia...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning, Mum... Dad...

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning.
-'Morning. Have your breakfast.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had my breakfast, Aunt. Besides, I'm getting late.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, everyone!
-Hello!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you getting late for class?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down, Kashif... Have your breakfast...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No time, Mum. Getting late...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... Your scruffy hair say as much!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know it, but this style's in vogue these days.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hashim! You know my girl doesn't like anyone poking fun at her hair.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to say anything about her hair...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sometimes, looking at something, you can't resist...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice try, Hashim. Anyway, I'm getting late.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye Mum. Bye Dad...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye!
-Bye!
-Okay, bye!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So late today... Gonna miss my first class...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should really work on getting up early, Kashif...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was busy with this assignment all night...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kashif...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at Annie... She studies all night too...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she can get up early... She knows how to manage her time...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can... But I'm not Annie! Anyway, I'm getting late...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
-Bye.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would Madame Quratulain allow me to put some music on?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got an exam today. Gotta study.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong, Annie? Always buried in a book! You're gonna ace it anyway!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta study to ace it. Focus on driving...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way. I ain't coming to pick you up again.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see about that...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, you're clever... You know I can't do that... You win this one...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I said something?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't compare Kashif and Annie...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Annie's her older sister. She could learn a thing or two from her.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but every kid is different...

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, can you imagine Kashif dressing up like Annie, like, ever?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Annie's always been good at her studies.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kashif's satisfied with scoring just enough to --
-Okay... I get it.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yeah...

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please try to accept Annie's new look.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop lecturing her on it all the time.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've accepted her.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't say anything.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except... Paying a little attention to herself?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. I know you inside out...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You almost didn't let her cover up!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you started bugging my late Mum ever since she started veiling!

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when did I say anything to her?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you remember?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At Ahmed's wedding anniversary, you said that Annie's been possessed by Mum... Which is why she's started covering up!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Amjad... That was just a lighthearted remark...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know it was her friend Ayesha's fault back then...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what's my fault? I'm getting late for office... Now where'd I keep the keys?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.
-Thank you.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you.
-Take care.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ayesha!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!
-Hey.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?
-Good, you.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About yesterday's assignment...

70
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,786
Come in.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
