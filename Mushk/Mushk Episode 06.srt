1
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,598
To the devil with you! Just -- Give him to me!

2
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:47,290
Give you my fortune worth two million in exchange for all the insult? Oh, please! Out of my way!

3
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,659
Guddi!

4
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,220
Guddi!

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,589
Gu --

6
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,731
Hello?
-Adam?

7
00:00:57,731 --> 00:01:03,070
The Lord heard my prayers... Bring Guddi and my son back. Quick.

8
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,210
I'm longing to see my son...

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,108
Adam? Why don't you say anything?

10
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:13,449
Hello?

11
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,050
Don't -- Don't tell me you let her go!

12
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,017
Look at yourself!

13
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:41,295
Looks like someone just robbed your face of its colour, leaving behind a blackened wasteland!

14
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,980
She's here!

15
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,098
The 7 p.m. train's here!
-She comes here everyday!

16
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:57,659
Thank Heavens!

17
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:05,430
He gives more when you're grateful! Whether you ask for it or not!

18
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,290
She's here! Chuff chuff!

19
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,727
She's gracing us with her presence! Chuff chuff!

20
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,594
I'm glad you listened to me.

21
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,971
I didn't say anything...

22
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,700
But...

23
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,180
I heard everything.

24
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,928
You never told me so much all these years...

25
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:05,468
You don't know it, but your decision woke me up.

26
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,987
Yeah...

27
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,150
I'll do it...

28
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,490
I'll marry her...

29
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,479
Mehek!

30
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,630
Mehek!

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,490
Yes, Grandpa?

32
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,439
Aye...

33
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,220
Guddi...

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,508
It won't happen again... I assure you.

35
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,330
Go... You need some rest.

36
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,210
Mehek...

37
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,708
I hope you're not worried now.

38
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,468
Of course, Grandpa.

39
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,918
Get some rest.

40
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,268
Hey...

41
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:23,570
I hope you know your place now.

42
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,980
You nearly forgot!

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,590
But don't worry. I won't let it happen again.

44
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll always be there to remind you.

45
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,930
Go and get some rest in '<i>your</i>' room...

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,430
Enjoy lying down on a proper bed! First time in your life, innit?

47
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,230
M'boy...

48
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,150
Adam!

49
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,090
Mr Malik!

50
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,791
Good morning... What brings you here?
-Good morning.

51
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,931
Good morning.
-Please, take a seat.

52
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:49,490
I heard you're not well.

53
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,890
Yeah... But I'm good now.

54
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,479
I couldn't come here because I was busy, but I was worried about you all day.

55
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,340
Thank you so much, Mr Malik... But I'm going with you to the factory... At Khanpore, right?

56
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,321
You're a lawyer... You've been with me for five years...

57
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:15,980
I always wonder why...

58
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,721
You don't want anything for it.

59
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:22,190
I respect you, Mr Malik.

60
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,281
It's an honour to work with you. It's my pleasure...

61
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:32,080
I'll be glad to serve you as a lawyer when that's needed.

62
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,070
I'll get you some tea... Before we leave.

63
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,681
Guddi!

64
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,560
Guddi!

65
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,760
Eh?

66
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,268
The maid isn't back.

67
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:06,100
But <i>someone</i>'s got to do the dishes. And do 'em properly.

68
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,030
Okay.

69
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,020
Okay.
-Right.

70
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,714
Right.

71
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:10,554
Right. Now!

72
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,290
Abdul!

73
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,490
Excuse me!

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,981
Ma'am?

75
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:43,920
I need to take my son to the hospital. I've been calling out but can't see anyone who can drive...

76
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,270
I'll go see...

77
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,820
Whoa...

78
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,820
What happened? Are you alright?
-Just my old age... I'm getting used to it.

79
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,790
I'll get the driver...

80
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:06,570
No... You need to rest. I'll go get him myself...
-Please, allow me. You've never been there... What'd Mr Khan say if you went out in this scorching heat?

81
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:13,118
No problem... Mr Khan isn't home. I'll ask the driver not to tell him.

82
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:17,798
You're not well. Get some rest. Take the day off.

83
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,827
Do these too.

84
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,340
But they're clean.

85
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,128
Well, do them again.

86
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:41,689
They'll be cleaner!

87
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,330
Ych a fi! Ever bothered to clean that tongue? It's so foul!

88
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,960
There's more...

89
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,290
Wash them quickly and properly!

90
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,900
Tad needs that money... You said you'd send it in a few days.

91
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,058
Five days to go... Gotta give them an advance for the jewellery and furniture!

92
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,427
Tauqir!

93
00:09:50,427 --> 00:09:52,307
Aslam!

94
00:09:53,108 --> 00:09:55,118
Anyone?

95
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,518
Water...

96
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,022
Water! You bloody tyrants...

97
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,720
Water... That's all I want...

98
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,071
I ain't asking you to set me free...

99
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,830
Water...

100
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,988
Wait!

101
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,799
I won't let you get away!

102
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,549
I lose because I love you.

103
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:47,660
No one can catch me!

104
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:54,628
Oh, please... You know just as well it's this ring that's stopping you! Try your best!

105
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,518
These red bangles suit you...

106
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:09,025
Your love colours every bit of me...

107
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:14,940
How much...

108
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,720
Do you love me?

109
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,990
Can you smell the fields?

110
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,640
They don't smell nearly as sweet as my love for you...

111
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,414
Really?

112
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,658
You're a monster, Asher Khan!

113
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:03,340
You locked Sajjad in just so you could marry me...

114
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,870
And told me he two-timed me?

115
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,102
That he left me...

116
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,372
He called you a friend!

117
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,990
Oopsie... Clean it again, will you? What're you looking at?

118
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,930
I want it whiter than white!

119
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,951
The doctor's here.

120
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,860
Good morning, doctor...

121
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,378
'Morning.

122
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,670
How's my husband?

123
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh, utterly spoilt...

124
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,460
Like a stinking rich man's spoilt brat!

125
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,458
Not easy to fix...

126
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,128
How much longer?

127
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:08,928
A month... At most...

128
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:11,030
And then?

129
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,920
Allow me...

130
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,980
Always...

131
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,120
Allow me...

132
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,482
To leave...

133
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,650
Put plainly...

134
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,340
You want to leave me in tears...

135
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,511
I'll take my leave...
-When would you be here again?

136
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:46,918
My grief longs to know...

137
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:58,060
If - God forbid - your husband dares get better, I'll be here.

138
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,567
Strange, innit?

139
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:05,067
I can't even pray for that day...

140
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,999
Come to my clinic sometime...

141
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,940
Tomorrow.

142
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,433
Take care.

143
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,353
See you.

144
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,188
See you...

145
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,649
Hey!

146
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,120
Leave him! We need to talk.

147
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:59,759
I've been humiliated so much keeping your secret that I think I might explode! Rub my feet, would you?

148
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,918
C'mon!

149
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,857
Mehek...

150
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,688
Madame -- Wants to -- See you...

151
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,046
I'll be there in a moment.

152
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,260
What d'you think you're doing, byt? Back to work!

153
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,360
iN a mOmENt.

154
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,330
I'm putting up with it for you! Normally, I'd...

155
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:57,552
Ankle!

156
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,970
Harder, byt... Harder... Ie...

157
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:08,740
I don't remember a day when you didn't speak a word!

158
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:16,990
The eyes have seen something...

159
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,840
That left me...

160
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,830
Tongue-tied and dumbstruck...

161
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,847
With shock, delight, and grief... All at once...

162
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:40,000
I've lost the strength to speak and the courage to think...

163
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,318
What'd you see?

164
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,380
Life...

165
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,518
My life... After ages...

166
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,430
Thank God...

167
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,130
She's fine...

168
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,230
The years have taken a toll on her face...

169
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,200
But...

170
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,290
But her eyes are the same old...

171
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,708
Pure... Lovely...

172
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,270
Who?

173
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,160
How are you?

174
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,020
Great.

175
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:57,031
Tell Mr Khan he's won.

176
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,208
Congratulate him...

177
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,448
Go...

178
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,590
Go and tell him...

179
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,260
I'll do as he says...

180
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,521
He'll be in Karachi for two days.

181
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:17,282
Oh, lovely...

182
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:24,942
I'll have two more days of company...

183
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,630
Go...

184
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,758
Come in.

185
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,671
You called me?

186
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:45,581
Cleaned the kitchen?

187
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,211
Yes...

188
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,730
Rub my feet.

189
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,138
Can't you hear me?

190
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,980
Rub my feet.

191
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,180
Sure...

192
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,420
Stop clawing at me!

193
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,850
Sorry...

194
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,060
I thought I'd make enough to pay for Chutki's wedding in 45 days and leave...

195
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:38,799
But I swear by my Mam... Me or my thoughts ain't taking one step out until I've made you pay!

196
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,719
Your downfall begins today...

197
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:48,268
What'd you say?

198
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:51,455
What'd you hear?

199
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,125
Nothing...

200
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,420
That's what I said...

201
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,447
Sometimes, you can hear thoughts...

202
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:01,147
Oh, I wouldn't dare...

203
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,087
Good. Do it properly...

204
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,917
I wouldn't dare <i>just</i> think... I'm gonna make sure!

205
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,410
Two minutes and I'll get you as always!

206
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:35,000
His name's Shayan. Studied with me at University. Yeah... We got married... My biggest mistake!

207
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,418
Got you!

208
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,348
Please save my son...

209
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:44,838
Please...

210
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,820
Time to play horsey!
-I got something for you, Mehek! Don't you want to see it?

211
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,670
After your sentence!
-You're really gonna love it, Mehek!

212
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,758
No excuses!

213
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,408
Okay...

214
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:12,830
Clippety-cloppety, clippety-cloppety!

215
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:26,580
I haven't done my time yet, Mehek... Who am I, but a prisoner?

216
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,160
Your cruelty has blinded you!

217
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,490
You'd kill me if you knew I found out!

218
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:29,350
It was never love, Asher Khan... You were just being bullheaded as always! What've you done?

219
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,830
And I lived so many years thinking Sajjad had cheated on me!

220
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,981
Kept comforting myself by cursing him...

221
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,630
Can't give up sweets, eh?

222
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,630
If you can't, you can give up coming here.

223
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,567
It won't let you live much longer.

224
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,640
Save yourself from paying my fees and leave it for your kids instead.

225
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,680
Jesus, why can't you understand?

226
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:17,629
Take these pills on time, okay?

227
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,870
Take it in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
-How much?

228
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,051
How much?
-200.

229
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,030
Well...

230
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,901
Take these...

231
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:50,110
Take these with some milk...

232
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,844
Take these with some milk on an empty stomach.

233
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,660
Thank you.

234
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,768
What's he doing?

235
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,018
Someone's been calling you for ages. Why don't you take the call?

236
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:16,500
That isn't my phone ringing, Shamim... It's my value rising every moment... Let me max it out...

237
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,060
Okay... Doctor's orders...? Next!

238
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,800
He promised to see me today!

239
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,308
But he isn't even taking my call! I've called him like 5,000 times!

240
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,417
Qutbuddin!

241
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,858
Qutbuddin!

242
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,559
Yeah?

243
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,987
I'm...

244
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,540
I'm not really well...

245
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,740
Take me to Dr Rana's... Get the car out...

246
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,768
Okay.

247
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,911
Who's this?

248
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,390
Hello?

249
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,350
Hello... Roshni...

250
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,990
It's Saqib.

251
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,648
I've been trying your number since yesterday! I haven't had anything!

252
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,650
Where are you? How are you?

253
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:19,470
The cops gave me a bad beating... Took my phone... Got me out of my job... Threatened to set me up for something really bad if I didn't leave the village in a week!

254
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:21,808
Did you have anything?

255
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:27,440
I don't have anything... The landlord threw me out...

256
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,770
Good Lord... We don't have classes for a week either...

257
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:36,830
Could you come here?

258
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,111
What if someone saw me?

259
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:45,152
Come in from the backyard like the other day.

260
00:29:45,152 --> 00:29:50,672
I'm more worried about you than my dignity or life.

261
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,712
If anything happens... I'm sure we can take care of it...

262
00:29:53,712 --> 00:29:59,680
Come here at 1 a.m. Everyone goes to bed by then. I'll be waiting.

263
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,511
Okay... This isn't my phone... I've borrowed it... See you at 1.

264
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,018
Okay.

265
00:30:08,018 --> 00:30:09,878
Okay...

266
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,988
We pulling an all-nighter...?

267
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,670
Are you asking or saying, sir?

268
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,341
No, sir, I'm requesting.

269
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,350
I thought... Madame's in here... She's left already?

270
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:00,421
I'm sorry... I didn't see her leave... Or... I would've cleaned up the place.

271
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,280
Shamim...

272
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:16,930
Remember that when it's an affliction of the body, they come in where you just came in from, and go out the same way.

273
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,747
Remember that when it's an affliction of the body, they come in where you just came in from, and go out the same way.
-Of course...

274
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:26,739
But when it's an affliction of the heart, they come in and go out by the back door.

275
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,300
Turn off the lights...

276
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,967
Close the doors.

277
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,941
You're alright, aren't you, Saqib?

278
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,830
Please, tell me... I'm so worried when I look at you...

279
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:51,974
It's all because of me...

280
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,760
Look here...

281
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,200
It hurts, doesn't it?

282
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,978
Yeah...

283
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,840
May their hands break!

284
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,317
Here's 20,000.

285
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:22,697
Take care.

286
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,848
Go.

287
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,938
Heavens...

288
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,918
What was that?

289
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,104
W -- What's going on?

290
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:57,905
Who are you?

291
00:32:57,905 --> 00:32:59,866
Who was that?

292
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,718
Who was that?

293
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:05,730
Who was that with you, Roshni?

294
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,650
Oh, can it!

295
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:21,539
We don't want your lies! We heard you with your lover, but you have the nerve to slander my innocent daughter now that Dad's here!

296
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,637
What?

297
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,730
What did you say?
-Only what I saw...

298
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,800
But no longer...

299
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,669
And I'm glad I saw it with my own eyes!

300
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:48,070
Because you look so eager to slander my daughter and taint her forever!

301
00:33:48,489 --> 00:33:52,740
Roshni... Why don't you tell her I just came here?

302
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,778
Put a sock in it!

303
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:05,048
If Dad were not here, I would've cut that lying tongue of yours!

304
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,387
Grandpa...

305
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:13,307
I swear by the first steps I took holding your finger...

306
00:34:13,307 --> 00:34:16,348
I don't -- I don't know who he was...

307
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,390
But Roshni w --
-Shut up!

308
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,991
Not another word!

309
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,818
Let her try and clean up her mess with her lies... Come!

310
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,439
Grandpa... I...

311
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:39,003
Please, Grandpa! Grandpa! Wait... No!

312
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:47,330
I thought her Grandpa's greys reflected some experience!

313
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,440
I could see 'GUILTY' written all over Roshni from here...

314
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,070
But he couldn't see Mehek's innocence from up close!

315
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,030
You disappoint me, gramps!

316
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,048
Who was that?

317
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,170
I want an answer!

318
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,780
S --

319
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,721
S -- Saqib...

320
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,050
How long do you know him?

321
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,460
Ten months...

322
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:45,280
Please, Grandpa... Open the door! I beg you!

323
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,270
Please hear me! Grandpa!

324
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:52,877
Grandpa...

325
00:35:53,630 --> 00:36:00,081
Please don't do that, Grandpa... Just listen to me...

326
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:08,180
Grandpa... Please... No...

327
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,468
Grandpa... Please...

328
00:36:12,468 --> 00:36:16,030
Grandpa... Open the door...

329
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:21,560
Open the door... Please...

330
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,288
No...

331
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,098
Grandpa...

332
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,580
I can't live without him.
-Shut your trap!

333
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:52,241
If you said another word or tried to tell them he was here to see you, forget living with him... I'll make sure you don't live another moment!

334
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,700
I'll see him in a few days.

335
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,000
You better tell him.

336
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
