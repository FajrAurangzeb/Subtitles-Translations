1
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,880
Come.

2
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,051
Munna!

3
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,721
Grandpa?
-Come here.

4
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,191
What is it?

5
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,135
N -- Nothing?

6
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,230
You look upset. What is it?

7
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,055
Not upset... Just hungry...

8
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:27,900
Go. Have something.

9
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,565
I can't bring myself to eat anything.

10
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:35,860
That's weird...

11
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,224
You look upset too. You hungry too?

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,413
No.

13
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:44,924
I'm not hungry.

14
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,645
Just...

15
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:49,378
A bit upset on the inside...

16
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,909
The last time I felt this way...

17
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,532
Was when Mehek had gone to London for her PhD.

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,990
She'll be back in two days...

19
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,779
But...

20
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,799
I have this sinking feeling...

21
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,750
May the Lord do what's best for her...

22
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,296
Amen.

23
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,933
Done your homework?

24
00:02:17,044 --> 00:02:18,773
No...

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,183
Why?

26
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,640
Forgot it...

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,717
Go. Do your homework! Focus on your studies, okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,126
We can't get everything we want, Mehek...

29
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,750
There's always something...

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,306
And quite often a lot... That we don't...

31
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,442
'Everything'... That can only describe the Lord...

32
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,520
If a man feels he's got everything he ever wanted, it's a sign...

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,970
That he's about to lose it all...

34
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,770
That he'll be pushed back to having nothing...

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,575
We only saw Guddi's bitterness...

36
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:39,131
Because we didn't like it one bit. Couldn't take it.

37
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,060
No one...

38
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,633
Including you and me...

39
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,107
Never tried to find out why...

40
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,069
But it's quite simple, really...

41
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,990
An ounce of bad times is all it takes...

42
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,094
To embitter the softest of hearts forever.

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,306
Don't even think about pitying me.

44
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:15,960
Running from pity has led me into the abyss...

45
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,379
No...

46
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,374
I don't pity you, Guddi...

47
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,473
I'm just telling Mehek...

48
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:29,002
You ought to thank her, Mehek...

49
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,469
She hasn't just helped you...

50
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:36,031
She's done you a favour.

51
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,556
And what about your favours?

52
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,549
'Favours'...

53
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,674
I've done myself favours...

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,580
What?

55
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,674
I mean --

56
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,484
Nothing...

57
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:04,074
Just 10 kilometres away!

58
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:08,905
From your son's Dad, and your honour, your love...

59
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:10,769
Congratulations.

60
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,164
Doc...

61
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,397
I'm not sure if I should be saying this, but...

62
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:08,685
As someone who's stood by you for ten years...

63
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:12,326
I think I ought to say this...

64
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:16,871
So... Without worrying about what you'd say...

65
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:19,840
I'd like to tell you what I think...

66
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,341
Yeah?

67
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:25,645
You're being used, Doc!

68
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:27,983
And --

69
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:31,030
It doesn't...

70
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,087
Suit you...

71
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,704
Stop --

72
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,494
Stop...

73
00:07:16,494 --> 00:07:19,137
What happened?
-Water... Air...

74
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:22,998
Here.
-Can't breathe... Water...

75
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,010
What happened?
-Nothing -- Just this -- fear --

76
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,540
Alright now?

77
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,174
Yeah...

78
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,997
Better...

79
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,455
Here we are. Home.

80
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,410
Welcome back where you belong.

81
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,003
Welcome back among those you hold dear.

82
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,005
Adam...

83
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,625
For God's sake...

84
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,470
Please don't say 'thank you'!

85
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,282
Go.

86
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,390
Aren't you coming?

87
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,790
No. I'd rather -- stay...

88
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,418
Out here...

89
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:44,516
I'll be --

90
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:49,006
Waiting to see a broad smile on your face when you come back...

91
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,600
Okay...

92
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,158
Even if she's too happy to come back...

93
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:09,315
Stay here...

94
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,917
Wait for me.

95
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,052
I'll be back...

96
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,396
I'm right here.

97
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,716
Ma'am?

98
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:58,168
Here for Mr Shayan.
-Just in time. It's nearly time for the wedding. Wait in the first room to the right...

99
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:02,710
Just in time. It's nearly time for the wedding. Wait in the first room to the right...

100
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,066
Okay.

101
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,792
C'mon, Mehek...

102
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:18,853
Shayan and Masooma Asher... Have you come here to enter into Marriage without coercion, freely and wholeheartedly?

103
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,757
I have.

104
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:39,183
Are you prepared, as you follow the path of Marriage, to love and honour each other for as long as you both shall live?

105
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,093
I am.

106
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,025
What happened?

107
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,995
What is it, Mehek?

108
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:37,415
Why are you crying?

109
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:38,900
Mehek?

110
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,312
For goodness' sake, say something!

111
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:46,971
Guddi?

112
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,870
What's up with her? Why doesn't she say anything?

113
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,401
I'll sort it o --
-No.

114
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:04,892
You're not going in there...

115
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,610
It's a funeral and they're singing a dirge for my love...

116
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,770
It's a funeral and they're singing a dirge for my love...
-Good Lord...

117
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,120
What happened to Shayan? Everyone alright?

118
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh, he's fine...

119
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,230
The blasted cheat...

120
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,822
I felt like strangling him with the garland he was wearing!

121
00:13:23,822 --> 00:13:25,088
Garland?

122
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,470
What garland?

123
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,246
Oh, I don't know, maybe one he's wearing to celebrate his marriage to his new love...

124
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,903
Marriage?

125
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,184
He off his head?

126
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,051
Lemme see what --
-No...

127
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:49,628
Please, for God's sake... Don't go in there...

128
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,295
By my misfortune...

129
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,500
Just let him go...

130
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,509
And let me go with him.

131
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,040
I've got a few nice things I'd like to say to him...

132
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,330
I've got curses for him...

133
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,083
Before I give him his kid. Here. Give him here.

134
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,260
W -- What are you saying?

135
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,117
C'mon.

136
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:18,354
He's my son -- I won't -- I can't let anyone take him away!

137
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:24,020
I'm doing what every woman should. Except fear, disgrace, and shame hold every other woman back.

138
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,144
I can't let him ruin another life!

139
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,200
Please, Adam... Just... Take me back...

140
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,254
I beg you...

141
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,407
Before...

142
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:43,842
I die of what I've seen...

143
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,763
Take me back...

144
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:49,425
Back home...

145
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:53,024
Please...

146
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,432
I'm so helpless...

147
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:19,786
My daughter's life has been ruined before my eyes...

148
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:22,669
But I couldn't stop it...

149
00:16:22,968 --> 00:16:24,648
No...

150
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,332
I'm cruel...

151
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,122
Silent witnesses and bystanders are cruel...

152
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,015
I am just as guilty...

153
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,340
But what could I do?

154
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,040
He's a mad dog...

155
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,846
Asher Khan...

156
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:47,396
I never cursed you because you're my daughter's father...

157
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:49,510
But I do today...

158
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,950
For all your pride and conceit...

159
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:58,465
May God condemn you to helplessness!

160
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,375
Mr Khan...

161
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,587
You alright? Mr Khan?

162
00:17:28,277 --> 00:17:29,449
Hmm?

163
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,959
You alright?
-Yeah...

164
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,800
Just a bit... Dizzy...

165
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,330
For a moment...

166
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,511
My body felt lifeless...

167
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,803
First time I've felt that way...

168
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,510
But I'm fine...

169
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,917
Just get me some water.
-Sir.

170
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,436
Mum...

171
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,780
Mum!

172
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,722
Mr Khan...

173
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,290
Yeah?

174
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:45,899
I don't like to see you worried.

175
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,181
It pains me.

176
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,625
Everyone except you...

177
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,109
Thinks badly of me...

178
00:18:56,516 --> 00:19:01,999
But I don't care what anyone else thinks.

179
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,908
Care begets worry.

180
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:10,570
Why worry if you don't care?

181
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,350
For this estate...

182
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,264
My grandfather...

183
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:23,374
Got my father's only sister...

184
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:26,165
Married to the Bible...

185
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,930
I've seen my Aunt...

186
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,070
Breathe her last in great pain...

187
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,890
And my grandfather, perhaps much more...

188
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,519
I can't do the same...

189
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,650
That's why...

190
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,686
I want to secure my daughter's future.

191
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,694
You?

192
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,800
Why not?

193
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,207
Here?
-Yeah.

194
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,300
Can't believe it?

195
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,013
I couldn't believe it too.

196
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:28,697
But that's why we're different.

197
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:33,550
I'm right here but your lying, deceitful self can't believe me!

198
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,490
And I believed every lie...

199
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,067
Every fairytale, every illusion you conjured...

200
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,803
Like a divine revelation!

201
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,691
How'd you get out?

202
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,660
The Lord God...

203
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,250
The Lord of the Worlds...

204
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,290
Who makes the night fall after day...

205
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,830
Who gave us life...

206
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,900
And will give us death...

207
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,570
He said 'Let there be light', and there was light to light up my endless night...

208
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,755
And sent one of His most devoted and fearless servants...

209
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:20,610
But why are you here?

210
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm not here to beg for your love...

211
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,505
Love isn't even on my mind right now...

212
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:34,000
It's long dead... Buried...

213
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,052
You killed it.

214
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,859
It can rest in peace, knowing it will be rewarded.

215
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,850
I just thought I'd let you know...

216
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,660
In case you've missed it, He's angry with you.

217
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,123
I don't think He's gonna spare you!

218
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,254
What've I done?

219
00:22:57,254 --> 00:22:59,010
I just got even.

220
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,760
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth... Honour for honour...

221
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I just did to you...

222
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,740
What your old man did to my sister!

223
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,639
You think you're the lord of this world?

224
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:15,291
'Settling scores'?

225
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,853
Taking His matters into your hands?

226
00:23:19,282 --> 00:23:24,620
You think you can satisfy the Most Generous and Merciful by settling scores?

227
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,870
He's going to fill your rusted old begging-bowl with restless disgrace...

228
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,637
And leave room for nothing else!

229
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,508
What'd I do to earn any of it?

230
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,401
You got even with my Dad by punishing me...

231
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,670
Was I there with him back then?

232
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,478
Did I do anything back then?

233
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,250
I was just a girl... Little and innocent...

234
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,072
Probably somewhere else playing with my toys...

235
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,641
I curse you for playing with my life...

236
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:16,526
May He never have mercy on you in this world or the next!

237
00:24:16,526 --> 00:24:18,510
Please --

238
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,820
Don't say that --

239
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,023
It's scaring me...

240
00:24:23,023 --> 00:24:26,103
I'm afraid...

241
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:29,479
He's already heard it by now...

242
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,269
Who is it?

243
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:47,402
It's me, Saqib!

244
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,246
Would you like some water?

245
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,950
No, thanks...

246
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,622
Was anyone here?

247
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,487
I think I dozed off...

248
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,650
I did too...

249
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,218
But I'd know if someone knocked or rang the bell...

250
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,530

What happened?

276
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,960
An animal...

277
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,800
I -- Is it alright?

278
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,385
Aye...

279
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,086
Inside!

280
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:22,630
C'mon! Double time!

281
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,416
Here! Sit!

282
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:28,707
Sit if you don't want a bullet in your head!

283
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,746
S -- Saqib...

284
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,942
Shut.

285
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:33,430
Shut. Up!

286
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,259
First rule of business: Never trust anyone.

287
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:51,500
I broke that and the second rule for you.

288
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,360
I paid you what you asked for.

289
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,029
But you!

290
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,398
You didn't even think what Ruby could do...

291
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,580
If you turned traitor, did you?

292
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,847
I didn't betray anyone!
-Shut your gob!

293
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,540
You sold her to me...

294
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,880
And then sent a merc to set her free?

295
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,976
I sent no one! I swear!

296
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,176
He won't spill the beans...

297
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:19,272
He won't spill the beans... Make him!

298
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,127
Stop!

299
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,333
If it's true...

300
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,543
Take your money...

301
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,928
I don't need it!

302
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,045
Where've you kept it, eh?

303
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,730
AYE, WHERE'S IT?

304
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,467
Keep your voice down, my sister's laid up.

305
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,280
Aye...

306
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,414
Where've you kept it?

307
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,189
The room back there...

308
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:52,005
Under the bed... The suitcase between the crates...

309
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,904
It's all yours...

310
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,592
Go get it.

311
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:00,103
Double time.

312
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:08,150
Did you think you could betray Ruby so easily?

313
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,832
Found it yet?

314
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,968
Open it!

315
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:31,333
That's that sorted out...

316
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:35,270
Now...

317
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,951
It's time you paid the price for your betrayal.

318
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,681
Give him what he deserves!

319
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,814
I want to hear him scream!

320
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,790
Just like that!

321
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,906
Break every bone in his body if you have to! Make sure he suffers!

322
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,239
No one can escape Ruby!

323
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,119
What?

324
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,661
What is it?

325
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:43,741
I'm scared...

326
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,726
What happened?

327
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,251
I hold Mum's hand... Or lay my head on Dad's chest... When I go to sleep...

328
00:32:54,251 --> 00:32:56,820
I'm very scared...

329
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,477
Don't worry, I'm here...

330
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,356
May I...

331
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,433
Hold you hand?

332
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,015
Go...

333
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,237
Just -- Go...

334
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,166
GO!

335
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,433
Mum...

336
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,630
What happened?

337
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,445
You alright?

338
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,413
Mum...

339
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,690
I was so scared...

340
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,850
When I asked my b --

341
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,060
Shayan...

342
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,103
If I could hold his hand...

343
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:37,669
He --

344
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:40,961
He kicked me out of the room...

345
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,076
M --

346
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,845
Mum...

347
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,926
Mum...

348
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,981
God settles all debts, doesn't He?

349
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:32,712
Good and evil?

350
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:34,975
Doesn't He?

351
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,994
Yes...

352
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,204
He'll make him pay, won't He?

353
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,369
I'm sorry we couldn't save her...

354
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,980
I know it's hard...

355
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,750
But it's what the Lord willed...

356
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
