1
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,440
Not so fast!

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,929
Where are you off to?

3
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,429
Home.
-Home.
-Home.
-Home.

4
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:48,509
Just... Wow... So you'd celebrate with wide smiles and a truckload of makeup, but leave your grieving friend all alone when things go south?

5
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,988
Aye, we should see Roshni...

6
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,327
What was that?

7
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:12,790
It took me a lifetime to earn this honour... And you stained it in a moment!

8
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,634
I've saved it!

9
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:23,148
My daughter's eloped with someone, bearing the pall of your honour and ours!

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:47,366
I saved it before they could start gossiping how Mr Malik, the guardian of everyone's honour and dignity, couldn't guard his own from his granddaughter!

11
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,787
Mr Malik!
-Grandpa!

12
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:58,020
On the chair... Quick...

13
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,287
Sit...

14
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,935
I'll get some water.

15
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:01,916
Grandpa...

16
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,577
Mr Malik...

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,682
Please, calm down...

18
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:11,140
For your health... Grandpa... Please...

19
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,450
Upstairs?

20
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,651
Yeah, she's upstairs. Double time.

21
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,401
Wait.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,200
Where are you going?
-We thought we'd see Roshni...

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,447
You want to see her when she's so troubled?

24
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:28,038
Don't even think about it!

25
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,303
Please calm down, Grandpa...

26
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:39,023
Please...

27
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,401
Here. Have some water.

28
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,293
Slowly...

29
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,959
In the Lord's name...

30
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,944
Qutb...

31
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:56,112
Get Adam...

32
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:59,742
Quickly...
-Right away.

33
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:01,795
I'll call him.

34
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,706
Are you better now, Grandpa?

35
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,700
How was the show?

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,196
I have to admit, lies suit you like the air of Heaven suits the lungs!

37
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:43,557
If you're telling the truth, it is my duty to help you...

38
00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:48,138
If not...

39
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:51,466
I stand with you regardless...

40
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,428
Because...

41
00:03:55,428 --> 00:04:11,648
I'd rather believe someone's plea and leave the matter to the Lord than start suspecting him... It sounds so much more reasonable...

42
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,247
It's the police!

43
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:22,577
Quick! Come with me! To my room! C'mon!

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,960
Inside!

45
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,103
Search over there.

46
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,720
It's...

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,650
It's okay...

48
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,513
Sit here... I'll be back in a moment... It's safe... I'll go have a look...

49
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,908
Aye, hello?

50
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,266
I'm at the station. Just got here...

51
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,339
Got a lead on one of Saqib's friends.

52
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:14,315
If they're here, they won't slip past!

53
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:19,300
We can use him to make him fall right into our trap!

54
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,787
Tell Qutbuddin to get here with his guards right now.

55
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:28,465
Fear insults love.

56
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:33,656
My love commands immense respect in my eyes.

57
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,703
Get it?

58
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,988
You're still here?

59
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,021
No, I'm waiting for the chief inspector.

60
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:51,749
I told you he'll be here in three hours. Go.

61
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:54,438
I can't go out.

62
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,924
Why?

63
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,020
My life's in danger.

64
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,324
Who could it be?

65
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,904
I said I'll talk to the chief inspector about it!

66
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:11,401
Have it your way...

67
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,530
Seen her?

68
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,128
No, sir.

69
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,280
Take a good look.

70
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,422
I'm pretty sure, sir. We just sold three tickets today.

71
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,710
And you?

72
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:43,840
If you find out anything about her, know that I've got 50,000 in my wallet ready to help a poor man in need.

73
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:45,970
Anyone?

74
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,020
I'd like to take another look, sir.

75
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,044
Here's my card.

76
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,412
Here.

77
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,175
You stay around here?

78
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah, he lives in a room back there.

79
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,826
What are you afraid of so much...

80
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:31,577
That a lifetime with me can't help you get over?

81
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,380
I'm not afraid for myself.

82
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,040
I buried that with my parents' honour.

83
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,065
I'm afraid they'll kill you...

84
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,720
They'll try to keep me alive to save their honour and they'll fail... I can't live without you...

85
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,303
If nothing else, I'll kill myself...

86
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:03,774
Embrace the unending punishment than live an unending life...

87
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:13,384
The fear of something happening to you won't let me be happy just yet...

88
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,971
Everything will be alright.

89
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:17,828
Sure?

90
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,350
Saqib...

91
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,425
Everything's fine... Don't worry...

92
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:31,586
Just... Some people looking for you.

93
00:08:31,586 --> 00:08:34,196
The train's late, as usual.

94
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:35,366
What do we do?

95
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,598
There's --

96
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:41,144
There's a bus stop by the station.

97
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,541
Go and get a bus... Don't wait around here!

98
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,790
So... Where is he? I know he's been with you for a year! Works with you, too!

99
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,580
B -- By the Lord -- I have no idea... I haven't seen him for a week...

100
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,548
You've got two hours. Do whatever you must and tell me where he is!

101
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,670
Our family's honour - and my claim to office - breath their last...

102
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,835
If anything happens to either...

103
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,744
I'll make sure you stop breathing too!

104
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:30,590
Keep at it until he spills the beans!

105
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:33,970
Remember...

106
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,795
How you'd ignored my words of love the first five times?

107
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:51,340
Not <i>just</i> words... I remember everything I ever thought about you as if it were just yesterday.

108
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:59,231
The fifth time was when you stepped out of the bus...

109
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,720
I thought you didn't deserve a place in my heart after that...

110
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,269
What changed your mind?

111
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,510
Nothing.

112
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:13,327
What about the five times that followed?

113
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:21,040
I thought just that the moment you turned me down... And started on my way home...

114
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,520
Barely took a few steps before I realised... My heart's empty...

115
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,920
There's nothing in it without you...

116
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:40,260
A few more steps, and I realised that all it ever beat for was you...

117
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:48,980
I could go to a carnival of lovers and get nothing for it.

118
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,697
No one would want a heart so lifeless, so worthless... So... Empty...

119
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,360
A year and a half?

120
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:07,969
Yes, sir. And his old friend for 14 years...

121
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,219
Death claimed him before he could...

122
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:17,765
I always suspected Asher Khan...

123
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,783
Sergeant!

124
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,599
Sir?

125
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,775
Get the car out. We leave at once.
-Sir.

126
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,503
Come.

127
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,840
Hello? Aye?

128
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,909
Shayan's run away, sir!

129
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,870
My helpless body...

130
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,510
Stands before you...

131
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,520
Crushed by calumny...

132
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:53,431
My pride, my honour, and if you will...

133
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:56,750
My soul...

134
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:01,717
Lie dead and abandoned out in the open for them all to see...

135
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:11,208
She trampled everything under her feet...

136
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,090
Order me, Mr Malik, and I'll do it.

137
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:30,470
Before the stench spreads far and wide...

138
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:46,560
Birthing whispers and canards all around this place...

139
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,876
Find Roshni, will you?

140
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,473
Please...

141
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,948
Mr Malik...

142
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:02,460
I may finally die in peace... I may...

143
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,894
Mr Malik!

144
00:14:03,894 --> 00:14:06,016
Qutbuddin!

145
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,158
Qutbuddin!

146
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:14,768
Get the car out! Quick!

147
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,059
Grandpa!

148
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:18,479
Mr Malik?
-Grandpa...

149
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,418
Mr Malik...

150
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,015
Grandpa?

151
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,783
Saqib!

152
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,653
Hey!

153
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:33,967
Finish the story, will you?

154
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:36,260
Which one?

155
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,590
You know, just now...

156
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,668
The Ten Expressions of Love?

157
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,483
Not cricket...

158
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,387
You're laughing at my question... And my love...

159
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,787
I'm not laughing at anything...

160
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:10,978
It's just the delight of having you right by me... Always...

161
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:38,490
Did you think I'd be deaf to your sinister silence all these years?

162
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:47,046
I can hear the storm raging, defiant and rebellious as always, even as we speak!

163
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,023
You helped him run away!

164
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:53,880
No, Mr Khan -- I --

165
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,978
Shut up!

166
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:06,380
I could walk the road to becomming the mightiest of the Khans because of my brains...

167
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:17,385
Give me a name and I can give you everything that ever goes on in his head with the utmost precision...

168
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,720
You're my wife...

169
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,985
That was no mistake...

170
00:16:37,985 --> 00:16:40,622
It was your sin!

171
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,758
But I'll deal with you later...

172
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,696
Get out!

173
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,624
Out!

174
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,557
Guards!

175
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,389
Guards!

176
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,815
Sir?

177
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,589
Surround this area. Let no one in.

178
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:09,056
Yes, sir.

179
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:16,970
Let no bus, wagon, rickshaw, taxi, or truck pass without being checked.

180
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,837
Sir.
-Sir.

181
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,534
I want Shayan... No matter the cost...

182
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,315
Thank you so much, Uncle.
-It's nothing...

183
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:07,655
The bus stops there very briefly... 3 minutes, at the most... Go, now, quickly...

184
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:13,736
Leave for your destination. The train's too big... They'll be suspicious...

185
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:20,654
'Thanks' can't do justice to the favour you've done...

186
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:24,238
Don't say that, m'lad...

187
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:31,291
A man shouldn't have to live to hear words of gratitude...

188
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,009
Never forget that...

189
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:43,997
We don't help others... At the end of the day, we're all just helping ourselves...

190
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:49,571
He alone can help... The Lord... The Almighty...

191
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:56,360
Ask for His help - His help - if you must... He will listen...

192
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:08,810
Don't do injustice to His favours by thanking people around... Just... Ask Him... He will help... Come...

193
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,437
He's had three heart attacks...

194
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,597
His condition's serious...

195
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,949
We're trying our best...

196
00:19:37,949 --> 00:19:43,358
Get these medicines as soon as you can.
-Right away.

197
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,828
Hello?

198
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:56,809
Mehek?

199
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,442
Your Shahmir's throwing up. He's got a burning fever too. I'm coming to the hospital.

200
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,796
God help us...

201
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,407
Hello?

202
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,856
Hello? H -- ?

203
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,865
Hello?

204
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:21,422
Yeah, I'm coming to the hospital. Don't drive me up the wall!

205
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,260
Not a bone left in him now...

206
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,970
He said the same before and after we broke each one... 'I don't know'.

207
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,174
I've searched every corner of this city...

208
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:53,700
Honestly, it just makes me wonder if the air of righteousness around...

209
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,143
Actually, never mind...

210
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:58,480
I've uncovered many secrets tonight...

211
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,674
As for her, I think she's left the city...

212
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,684
What do I do...

213
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,772
Adam!

214
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:21,893
Adam... Shahmir's all out of sorts... Guddi's coming here...

215
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:27,120
But I can't even see my son... Please...

216
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,501
Take care of him, will you?

217
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,919
Got it?
-Here.

218
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,347
Just a minute...

219
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,243
Hello?

220
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:46,310
Sorry if I've disturbed you, mate...
-Not at all. What is it?

221
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,740
We've found the man you were looking for... Shayan...

222
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,978
He's the nephew of one of the biggies here, Asher Khan.

223
00:21:55,978 --> 00:22:00,960
Okay, text me the rest. I'll get back to you.
-Okay.

224
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,032
Mehek...

225
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:37,097
I know this is neither the time, nor the place, but...

226
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:40,326
You got to know this...

227
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,360
Congratulations... We've --

228
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:07,751
Your Grandpa's losing a battle for his life! Never thought I'd see you two going all lovey-dovey here!

229
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,761
Come!

230
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,517
Shahmir...

231
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,648
Blimey, he's burning for real...

232
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,133
Mehek...

233
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,418
Your Grandpa may well be breathing his last...

234
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:42,967
The doctors trying to save whatever's left of him! Could you not be so cold-hearted for a change?

235
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,670
Come with me!

236
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,782
M'bo -- Sh --

237
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,700
Come with me, sir.

238
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,882
Stop!

239
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:29,892
Orders, sir?

240
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:35,987
Surround the mansion. I want a man there, there, and there... Everyone else, form up on me...
-Come, Inspector.

241
00:24:37,107 --> 00:24:39,932
Step aside. Wait here.

242
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,817
Come.

243
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,928
Where are we going?

244
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:04,600
I've got an Aunt 'round here. Thanks to her, I never felt like I'd lost me Mum and Dad...

245
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:11,680
I never felt alone because I always had her.

246
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,286
She's been waiting eagerly for you.

247
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:15,934
Me?

248
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:21,848
Yeah. She knows just how much I love you.

249
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:26,869
I say we get married as soon as we get there.

250
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:28,020
Today?

251
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,735
Yeah.

252
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:39,531
I'm impatient to hear you say 'I do' and become mine forever.

253
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,626
I'll be back.

254
00:25:56,626 --> 00:25:57,978
Okay.

255
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:06,170
The doctor says he's fine now. His fever's not coming back.

256
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,267
Thank God...

257
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,760
May God give you everything you've ever wished for.

258
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,370
How's Grandpa?

259
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,650
Thank God...

260
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:27,082
The doctor says he's better... He'll come to by the afternoon.

261
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:29,994
You've been kind, O Lord...

262
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:33,652
I've been praying for his health all night...

263
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:38,980
But... Where's Guddi?

264
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,411
Sleeping... She found an empty bed around here.

265
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,903
The doctor says we can take him home.

266
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,120
I've sent Aunt home too... To get some rest...

267
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,917
Take Guddi and Shahmir home...
-Okay.

268
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:11,596
I will not say 'thank you', for your favours are too great for any amount of gratitude.

269
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,460
I bless you every time I pray... Every single time...

270
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,013
I'll go check on Grandpa.

271
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,590
We've found Shayan.

272
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,900
Congratulations.

You seriously here to arrest him, Inspector? Seems more like you're droppin' by for a nice little cuppa! Do you think he'd come and surrender just like that?

279
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,424
He'd run away, sir!

280
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:42,419
My men have surrounded the mansion.

281
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,187
Khan's got a reputation here...

282
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:55,487
Besides, he's only been accused... Got to show some respect... For now...

283
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:59,299
Grab a pew and don't you dare lecture us.

284
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,528
Where'd you go now?

285
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,602
Home.

286
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,352
And then, to Shayan...

287
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,168
Mind if I ask something?

288
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:49,918
Not at all.

289
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,720
How do you think he could bring himself to leave you for so long?

290
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,449
May I speak freely?

291
00:30:00,878 --> 00:30:04,175
You don't need to ask.

292
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:26,050
My eyes have longed to see him and my ears to hear the news that he's been found... I'd been standing in the searing sun, last in a long line...

293
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:34,508
When Grandpa's grief overtook me and stopped my feet from inching closer to the glimmer of hope...

294
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,552
Find Roshni first...

295
00:30:40,813 --> 00:30:44,777
I've just thought about myself...

296
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,400
It's time I changed things...

297
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,215
Before my fear of losing my own becomes my reality...

298
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,864
Please...

299
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:58,757
Find Roshni...

300
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,810
As you sa --

301
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:10,842
Dyw, what a lovely twist in our love story... From romantic to tragic!

302
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:20,170
She's got tears in her eyes... He's got some too, but of happiness... Seeing his love up close, after all!

303
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,530
I'm laughin' at the clouds so dark above... Get ready to be singin' in the rain!

304
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,585
I'll get going...

305
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,358
Your tyranny ends today!

306
00:31:59,358 --> 00:32:07,310
This man held his old friend captive for 14 years, and me for a year and a half!

307
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:13,054
Arrest him right now! Right now...

308
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,470
Good morning, sir.

309
00:32:18,507 --> 00:32:22,270
How are you, Mansoor?
-Never been better, Mr Khan.

310
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:35,720
I must say, sir, the kid's more than a bit hot-headed... He doesn't have the foggiest that we take orders from you...

311
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:42,235
Oh, the lies he told about you...

312
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:46,640
His audacity made me tremble...

313
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:55,840
I felt like giving him a proper pasting until I tired of it...

314
00:32:57,698 --> 00:33:01,740
But... He's family...

315
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,984
I couldn't help but kill my anger...

316
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:11,335
You deserve a handsome reward.

317
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,556
Thank you, Mr Khan.

318
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,394
You betrayed me!

319
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:22,393
Always a pleasure.

320
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:27,939
For what he's done for us, I'd gladly offer him my life.

321
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:34,810
No, Khawar... Please... Wait! For the love of God... Don't do this...

322
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,728
Tauqir!

323
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:36,768
Sir?

324
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,333
Get them all a cuppa...

325
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,692
Don't take my kids away... I'll die without them!

326
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:44,030
Get away!
-Shayan!

327
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:51,210
Please... Please stop him... He's taking my kids away... Says I'll never get to see them again... Please... Stop him...

328
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:59,370
Please, Khawar... Don't do this to me... I haven't dared raise my voice... For my kids... What've I done?

329
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,737
Mr Khan's orders.

330
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,462
Khawar!

331
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:10,955
Divorced her yet?
-You didn't order me to.

332
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,924
Do it.

333
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,370
I, Khawar Maqbool Hussain, do s --
-No!

334
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:25,550
Please, no... Don't do that to me...

335
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:32,219
Please... I'll do what you say... Please... Stop him... Uncle... Please save my family...

336
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:35,800
You don't need to do anything...

337
00:34:36,065 --> 00:34:39,431
Only your brother can save you now.

338
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,545
Tell him to do as I say.

339
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,855
Just do as he says... Save me... My family... My kids... Please...

340
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,248
Where's her cupboard?
-There.

341
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,437
Adam...

342
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,130
Promise me...

343
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,960
Do whatever you must...

344
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,012
To bring Roshni back...

345
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,320
Mum says...

346
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,506
If Roshni didn't come back...

347
00:35:57,506 --> 00:36:00,560
She'd kill herself...

348
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,838
I'm very scared...

349
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,648
'For my Roshni'?

350
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,882
'Lots of love, Saqib'...

351
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,460
That's him?

352
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,194
Yes.

353
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,016
If there's anyone more loyal to Mr Khan than his dogs, that'd be me.

354
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:33,312
I owe 80% of my body to Mr Khan's favours.

355
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:39,295
Your sister and her kids are just my duty.

356
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:49,370
Don't ever think of me as her husband or their father, for I am nothing but Mr Khan's humble servant.

357
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,517
Don't you fear the Lord?

358
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,400
You don't have permission to ask questions.

359
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:08,000
Do as Mr Khan says, or my tongue only needs one order from him to divorce her.

360
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
