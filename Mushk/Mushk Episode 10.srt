1
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,274
We need to talk. Just the two of us.

2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,570
His blood pressure's very low. He's running a temperature of over 104.

3
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,800
Yet you're insisting you'd rather not go to the hospital... You do realise his life's in danger, don't you?

4
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,475
I don't need to take him to the hospital...

5
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:01,732
When their best doctor's here.

6
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,093
As you say.

7
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,653
Munshi Nizam!

8
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,993
Sir?

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,970
Get the doctor whatever he asks for.

10
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,047
And...

11
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:19,250
He's staying here tonight. Make sure he's comfortable.

12
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,399
As you say, sir.

13
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:23,027
Okay?

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,888
You'll be fine.

15
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:41,217
Be a man!

16
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,510
Dyw, look at him... Like the Devil himself!

17
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,140
His sickness holds him captive...

18
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,610
I've heard everything about you from Qutbuddin!

19
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,930
And I know just what ails you! Well, almost...

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,880
Hello? Guddi?
-Ie...

21
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,438
Could you tell me what this shot's for? I sent you a pic.

22
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:03,303
Just a second...

23
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,200
Hello?

24
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:21,573
Blimey, Guddi... That's a slow poison... Kills slowly and without a trace... What are you up to?

25
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:24,122
I'll get back to you.

26
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,787
Dr Rana and your wife are giving you these shots of death...

27
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,390
So sorry...

28
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,317
But I meant to disturb you. It's time for your medicine.

29
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,682
My heart is heavy...

30
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,691
Everything tastes so... Bitter... Venomous...

31
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:15,327
I can't take any more...

32
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,460
Please... Do me a favour...

33
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,712
Pray tell. Your wish is my command!

34
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:27,719
Just throw the pills somewhere...

35
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:32,243
And tell my wife I've taken them.

36
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:33,739
Okay.

37
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,434
I can do that.

38
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,387
Let me rub your feet. I'm sure you're tired.

39
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:40,957
Let me rub your feet. I'm sure you're tired.
-Thank you, I don't really need --

40
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:42,699
Thank you, I don't really need --
-Oh, please... Allow me...

41
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,271
Oh, please... Allow me...

42
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,671
You haven't had anything.

43
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,249
Yeah. I'm not hungry.

44
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:16,888
Munna left something in the fridge for you.
-Go to bed...

45
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,854
Now, don't answer if you get a call from her number. Her Mam calls you to check.

46
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,553
Please, Saqib... Talk to me!

47
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,737
The stage is set for Aunt's downfall...

48
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:14,125
The time to act, Guddi, is now!

49
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:18,704
Can't you hear the clocks ticking?

50
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,250
I've been waiting for two days. Where were you?

51
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,490
Shush your lips and open your ears wide!

52
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,921
So wide that everything you hear goes straight in!

53
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:53,417
Roshni's Mam has betrothed her.

54
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,680
She's getting married one of these days.

55
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,945
What?

56
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:06,000
Before you start getting any ideas, lemme tell you that a contract man's itching to earn something for his kids.

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,550
What do you want me to do?

58
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,823
Pay attention, mush...

59
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,834
Psst!

60
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,227
What is it?

61
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,845
Come.

62
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,663
Quickly!

63
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,050
Patience - and trust in Guddi - always pays off! Told you!

64
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,138
What is it?

65
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,090
Here.

66
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,013
Talk to him.

67
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,767
Hello?

68
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,726
Roshni... It's Saqib...

69
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,099
Saqib!

70
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,340
I've waited so long to hear your voice...

71
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,060
Shed so many tears it hurts to close my eyes...

72
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,812
We don't have much time... Just listen to me...

73
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,080
So just do as Guddi says. I'm in touch with her...

74
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,734
And...

75
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:25,853
I love you so much I could never even imagine leaving you...

76
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,128
Bye.

77
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,250
Bye.

78
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,674
You want him, don't you?

79
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,110
Alright, then... Act 1 - Acquiescence! Just do as your Mam says!

80
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,310
Convince her you've surrendered before her honour!

81
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,066
Make the road ahead easy for us!

82
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,412
Okay.

83
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,809
As you say.

84
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,244
Shh!

85
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,857
What?

86
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,076
Tomorrow?

87
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:51,919
Hardly surprising, now, isn't it?

88
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,356
Isn't that what we always wanted? To get them married off at the earliest.

89
00:10:56,356 --> 00:11:01,980
They wanted some time... They'll tell us in the evening tomorrow. Sit...

90
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:12,427
It's for the best. The earlier they got married, the easier it will be for Roshni to get a visa.

91
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,048
How will we prepare in one day?

92
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:23,053
The Lord has given us everything. Even time bows before money.

93
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:29,570
I'm sure we can do it. Go and get gowns for Roshni and Mehek.

94
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,213
I'll take care of everything else.

95
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,873
As you say, Dad.

96
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,373
What colour do you want his suit to be?

97
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,649
Ehh?

98
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,810
What colour would you like Adam to wear? Adam, you know, the man you like?

99
00:11:52,810 --> 00:12:00,375
If you ask me, the man should pick what he likes... Whether you like him or not! What d'ya say, Roshni?

100
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,091
Let him pick what he likes... Or ask the one who likes him...

101
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,730
Hey...

102
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,560
Why are you wasting a hundred gee on his suit? He's just a groom for hire... Just rent one!

103
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,390
Return it with the man! How's that?

104
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,145
He's better now...

105
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,676
What are you doing here?

106
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,000
Just...

107
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,350
Checking on you...

108
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,910
Thought I'd massage your head... It hurts, right?

109
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,003
Who asked you to do anything?
-No one? I just thought --

110
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,147
Go... What if someone saw you here?

111
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,854
So what?

112
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:17,900
Just go!

113
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,498
Don't just barge in like that!

114
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,857
Go!

115
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,477
So you're the one!

116
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,153
Do you see anyone else around here?

117
00:13:56,153 --> 00:14:02,080
Of course... I can see the restlessness seizing your right hand...

118
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,550
And helplessness, or perhaps heedlessness (Or is it meanness?) clutching the little finger on your other hand...

119
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,550
And, of course, the burning flame that brought you here, the love in your eyes... That makes four of you!

120
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,504
By the way, I note you haven't got any notes. I don't like it one bit.

121
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:24,329
I would have them in my hands if they were a couple thousand... But I've got a hundred.

122
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:29,920
Blimey, you have the gift of the gab... Just like me! Neat!

123
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,134
But... How do you know Aunt gave me the money?

124
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,848
Oh, well...

125
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:39,172
You know this doctor close by? Let's just say he's <i>very</i> close.

126
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,338
Your mother-in-law called to tell him.

127
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,055
I don't know about the walls, but I have ears.

128
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:50,916
Not gonna lie to you, they can go to any lengths to hear what they want! How's that?

129
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,727
Thank you.

130
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,777
Just follow the plan.

131
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,207
Bye!

132
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,911
And...

133
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:08,060
This isn't the price for my help...

134
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,610
You're celebrating your love with some charity!

135
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,262
Adam!

136
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,722
First time I've seen a groom too busy with his horses to dress up nicely!

137
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,656
Groom?

138
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,013
Good Lord, what do you mean?

139
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:56,907
You're getting engaged this evening and all my friends are coming over to celebrate!

140
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,166
I'm just getting engaged, Guria... Not married...

141
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,340
Don't call me a groom just yet...
-Why not? You're a groom to-be!

142
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,114
And I can't tell you how happy I am for you!

143
00:16:15,114 --> 00:16:19,350
I'll be over the moon the day you got married!

144
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:28,854
Here... Mehek will be walking under the shade of this lovely cloth as they seat her with you!

145
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,900
You'll look so lovely together!

146
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,450
Aren't you happy?

147
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,820
Hmm?

148
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,346
When did I say that?

149
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,255
It's just --

150
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,878
I'll talk to you when I'm back...

151
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,630
I'll be waiting!

152
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,094
Hey!

153
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,300
Yeah?

154
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,600
Where are you coming from?
-Had to get my phone topped up. Something you need?

155
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,411
I called you so many times! You didn't even bother to answer!

156
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:30,564
Had to get some fresh air to top my energy up too. Got a problem?

157
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,018
Get all of this inside, Imam Deen.

158
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,998
Good Lord!

159
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:46,980
Blimey...

160
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:54,210
You've barely got the news that your brother's getting engaged, and you're putting up this show like it's his wedding!

161
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,020
Of course. He's my only brother. And a real prince at that!

162
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,358
Were it up to me, I'd make the entire city cut a rug!

163
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,416
Where are you off to, Adam?
-Adam!
-Here...

164
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:08,380
What happened?

165
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,200
Blimey, I haven't seen a groom so coy...!

166
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,565
Leagues ahead his bride!

167
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,716
It's nothing like that, just...

168
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:22,700
I got a few things to do...
-Hey! Wait a minute!

169
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,015
I got to go, Guria. I'll be back.

170
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:27,400
No. You gotta stay here with us.
-I told you, Guria... It's important...

171
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,758
I told you, Guria... It's important...
-We aren't singing or playing before you sit with us.

172
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,705
We aren't singing or playing before you sit with us.
-Aye.

173
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,277
Why are you bothering my son like that?

174
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:37,230
No one's bothering him! We're just celebrating with him!

175
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,170
He ought to sit here!
-But... I gotta go...
-Yeah, right here!
-Now we're talkin'!
-Okay...

176
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,959
As you like it!

177
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:48,800
But you're doing what I ask you to after an hour.

178
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,100
And... Get your brother a nice suit, okay?

179
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,610
And... Get your brother a nice suit, okay?
-Of course.

180
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,467
And... Get your brother a nice suit, okay?
-Of course.
-Yay!

181
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,768
Of course.
-Yay!
-Woo hoo!

182
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,709
Mehek...

183
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,500
(Guddi!)

184
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,060
Guddi!

185
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,294
(Here!)

186
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,987
Here!

187
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,755
Mum'll be back.

188
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,561
Grandpa?

189
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,575
Everything alright?

190
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,919
What are you doing?

191
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,835
You're happy with it, aren't you?

192
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,014
Don't worry.

193
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,940
Everything's going to be alright.

194
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,874
I hope indeed...

195
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,167
Bless you, my girl.

196
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,672
God bless you.

197
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,297
Go get some rest... You'll need it.

198
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,993
Do not disgrace me...

What's up? Why's he crying so much?
-He's got a fever. A real bad one.

225
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,571
What?

226
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,604
What happened? Shahmir...

227
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,400
And you're telling m --

228
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,413
Took you long enough to find out!

229
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:38,480
He was sleeping for a few hours. Got up and started crying just now. I found out when I touched him.

230
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,271
Here.

231
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,750
Where are you going? Let me dress your hair!

232
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,290
Forget it.
-Stop her, will you? Where's she off to?

233
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,870
Stop her, will you? Where's she off to?
-Just a minute...

234
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,852
Ehh?

235
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:55,217
Munna!

236
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:56,725
Munna!

237
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,821
Munna!
-Yeah?

238
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,383
Ask the driver to get the car out. Right now!

239
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:02,541
Everything fine?

240
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:07,924
Shahmir's got a bad fever! Quickly, now! Get going!
-Okay.

241
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,040
Where are you off to?

242
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,460
Uhh...

243
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,865
He's got a bad fever.

244
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:23,313
But why are you leaving when the guests are almost here?

245
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:26,038
I'm taking him to the doctor.

246
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,548
Why?

247
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:33,598
Where's his mother? Why can't she take him?

248
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,305
The car's waiting for... you...

249
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,917
There she is! I'm sure she can take him herself.

250
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,425
Just... Had to get my shawl... Here.

251
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,426
Guddi!

252
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,852
Guddi!

253
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,547
Guddi?

254
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,400
Come in.

255
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,934
You called me?

256
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:25,190
Go and get Guddi. I've been calling her for ages!
-She's gone!

257
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,676
But when? And where?

258
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:33,783
She's gone to the hospital with the k -- h -- her kid...

259
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:35,987
Okay, go...

260
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:50,470
What kind of trial is this that holds uncertainty at every turn, every step?

261
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:59,979
My son... My life... Is unwell... And I can't even take him to the hospital...

262
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:11,228
This is no trial... It's damnation! It's a curse! An unending nightmare...

263
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,936
Hello?

264
00:26:34,936 --> 00:26:37,680
Did you have to leave for the hospital right now?

265
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,830
Aye, as if I'd invited this fever that's ailing him!

266
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:45,667
What if it took you too long and I got married here?

267
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:51,334
It won't. Don't worry. It's just five minutes to the hospital. That makes fifteen minutes until he gets his shot and half an hour until I get back.

268
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:57,595
Just... Keep the stylists busy... Ask them to start over again. Just keep them busy, okay?

269
00:26:57,595 --> 00:26:59,769
Please come back quick...

270
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,720
Step on the gas!

271
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,931
Go and give this to the servants.

272
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:30,650
My son outshines every royal in the world today.

273
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,504
That's how charming you look.

274
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,453
Bless you.

275
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,566
Guria, bring him downstairs. Come.

276
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:46,620
Adam...
-Hmm?

277
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,257
Mind if I ask something?
-Of course not.

278
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:56,472
How does it feel to see your one cherished dream become a reality?

279
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,380
What do I tell you?

280
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,858
Just how you feel.

281
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:16,620
It feels like this room is teeming with happiness...

282
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,995
Every one of them looking me in the eye, smiling...

283
00:28:20,995 --> 00:28:24,240
Laughing... At me... Mocking...

284
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,913
It's all just... Happiness that'd bring you to tears...

285
00:28:32,913 --> 00:28:35,230
One blink and they'd roll down...

286
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,848
Blimey...

287
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,544
Bless you...

288
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,628
Tears of happiness!

289
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,537
Yeah, right...

290
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,936
Come.
-Yeah...

291
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,580
Just give me a minute.

292
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,270
Hello?

293
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,360
I've called you so many times! What are you doing?

294
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,870
I'm not getting a pedicure at a parlour, get it?

295
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,071
I'm getting your son treated, so you better watch what you're saying.

296
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,929
How's he?

297
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,170
The doctor says it's nothing serious.

298
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,527
He's given him a shot. I'm coming back.

299
00:29:51,527 --> 00:29:55,450
Good Lord... It must've hurt him so much...

300
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,243
Of course. Not like it's gonna tickle him, yes?

301
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:03,510
I'm on my way. Don't call me again.

302
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm here.

303
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,380
What's up with her?

304
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,312
No idea. It's been an hour and she's still in the loo!

305
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,234
I'm tired of waiting.
-Me too.

306
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:25,160
How much longer do you need?

307
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,544
I'm coming...

308
00:31:27,544 --> 00:31:29,510
What about the other functions?

309
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:33,617
We can't go anywhere because of her!
-Yeah...

310
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,708
Hello?

311
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,133
Where are you?

312
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:50,718
On my way. Halfway home.

313
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:53,964
They'll be here for me in ten minutes!

314
00:31:53,964 --> 00:32:06,004
And guess what, he's already there, waiting for you. Having killed his act of two-timing, he's standing close to the back gate, carrying its coffin!

315
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,913
Just be done with it already, Mehek... I'm on my way!

316
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,843
We gotta get back before these folks! I've got the jewellery with me.

317
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:53,950
They're blocking the entire road!

318
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,791
Just peep or something! Quickly!

319
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,405
Yeah... Good...

320
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:02,652
Quickly!

321
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,880
Faster!

322
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,614
Wonder what she's doing in there!

323
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,630
Where's Roshni?

324
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,145
She's been in the loo for half an hour!

325
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:06,295
We've got other clients too, just in case!

326
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,907
Roshni!

327
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,976
What are you doing in there? They're almost here.

328
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,350
Well --
-They haven't even done your makeup properly!

329
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,880
She hasn't even got her cloak on! What are you even doing here?

330
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,477
And what were <i>you</i> doing in there?

331
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:31,550
I've barely been in there five minutes!

332
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,117
Hurry up!

333
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,845
Get her ready quickly!
-Okay.

334
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:39,208
Close the door.

335
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,647
Blimey, this bride sure knows how to deck up!
-Mehek!

336
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:49,467
Mehek!

337
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,284
Adam's family just came in! I swear he looks like royalty!

338
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:58,939
I'm sure you won't even blink if you saw him!

339
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,250
Get ready quick, we've got to take you downstairs!

340
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,667
Could you go out for a minute, Salma?

341
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,512
My boy...

342
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,268
M'boy...

343
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,813
He's fine!

344
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:36,361
The doctor says the shot will kill the fever in no time. He'll be just like he was!

345
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:38,398
C'mon, now, get ready quick!

346
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:43,303
Adam's here, wearing a coat of lies over his truth!

347
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,732
C'mon!

348
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,968
Hello?

349
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,040
Hello.

350
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,334
You used to praying?

351
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:16,300
No.
-Why?

352
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:24,710
I prayed for something a few years back... Shed a few tears too... But my prayers were never heard... I don't really believe in praying now...

353
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:33,600
Well, then, rewind the clock and start praying. I'm about to snatch the bait from the lion's maw! Be ready. Bye.

354
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,740
God help us all...

355
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
