1
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,668
I've been waiting for ages!

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,258
I got up the moment I got word...

3
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:38,818
Had to stop when Mum asked me to...

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,458
There's something you must know...
-I'm all ears. Go on.

5
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,290
Munna...

6
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,620
Where's Grandpa?

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,841
In his room... Smiling to himself...

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,201
Okay... And Aunt?

9
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:09,201
In her room staring emptily at the ceiling. I asked her if she'd like to have breakfast but she didn't say a word.

10
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:18,240
Okay. Go and wait outside Grandpa's room... And come here and tell me the moment he steps out. Okay?

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,717
Okay.

12
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,369
Mehek...

13
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,719
I'm waiting.

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,180
What is it?

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,629
What should've happened long ago.

16
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:36,800
But better late than never...

17
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,658
What?

18
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,988
I want a divorce...

19
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,817
Good Lord...

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,820
What happened?

21
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:09,690
'Divorce'... They say the sound of it makes the heavens tremble...

22
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,463
That's why I exclaimed...

23
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,466
What do you think?

24
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:21,414
Shouldn't I be doing this?

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,351
I wouldn't dare call right what the Lord detests the most.

26
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,841
But... It's your life...

27
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:38,812
Your decision...

28
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:43,778
You can say that I'm wrong...

29
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:46,529
I give you the right...

30
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,900
Shayan's wrong.

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,290
In fact... It's a massive understatement...

32
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,848
He's depraved. Vile...

33
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,071
But you've made a mistake too...

34
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,801
Aye.

35
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,650
I know.

36
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,358
I couldn't see through his lies...

37
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:17,770
I lost my heart to him without a thought...

38
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,679
I've made a big mistake...

39
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:25,669
To love is not to err, Mehek, and I won't say you're wrong for loving him...

40
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:35,928
You should've looked him in the eye and asked him why he chose to betray you.

41
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,057
Strange, yes, but I've got this feeling that he's got his reasons... Something else...

42
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,900
It'd be most unfortunate if he chose to betray someone like you.

43
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,120
If you ask me, Adam...

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,470
The loyal don't give in to any kind of 'reasons'...

45
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,588
They'd rather die...

46
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,988
Than betray...

47
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,538
Get my divorce papers ready.

48
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,980
Think again.

49
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,098
Wait a day...

50
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:25,668
I've thought it over a hundred times...

51
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:29,763
I've come to the same conclusion every time.

52
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,171
I want a divorce.

53
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,209
Okay. Just one condition.
-I accept everything.

54
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,509
I'll go there myself.

55
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:44,959
Ask him why.

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,026
Okay...

57
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,008
But get the papers ready.

58
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,788
I'll get going...

59
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:04,490
Could you do me another favour?

60
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,966
I could give you my life.

61
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,238
You couldn't --

62
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:18,848
Give my son -- Your name -- Could you?

63
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,629
Aliya...

64
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,430
What is it?

65
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,539
Hear that drum? It's from inside!

66
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,147
Yeah...

67
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,280
Good Lord...

68
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:56,799
Don't worry.

69
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,830
It's a celebration!

70
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,552
A celebration... That's when it gets ready to strike...
-What?

71
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:06,381
Grief...

72
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,206
I'll get going... Got to get some papers ready...

73
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,031
I don't think you've got the time to have tea now, yes?

74
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,100
Yeah... Well... No...

75
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm so sorry...

76
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,755
No.

77
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,728
You don't need to be.

78
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,231
Have it your way.

79
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,148
Congratulations, Adam!

80
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,828
Didn't see you were here...

81
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,520
But -- Mr Malik...

82
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,270
What's the news?

83
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,530
I'm alive again!

84
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:18,085
One word of good news is all it took to scare every pain away.

85
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,070
Malik Jr's better!

86
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,760
Great...

87
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,590
Great indeed, Mr Malik... Congratulations!

88
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,830
Our prayers have been heard.
-Of course...

89
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:37,520
Munna! Get some flowers! M'boy's back! I want a grand welcome!

90
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,629
Everything's ready. Shall we?

91
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,900
Looks like that's Dad's car.
-Come.

92
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,007
How are you?
-Great!

93
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,538
Okay, that's enough, stop it!

94
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:38,978
In the Lord's name...

95
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,388
Why'd you tell them to stop? Don't you like it?
-Oh, I love it!

96
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:49,200
I just wanted to hear the happiness I see in your eyes.

97
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,329
Why'd you hide it? Why didn't you tell us you're feeling better?

98
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:59,400
You know me inside out.

99
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,760
I don't like to keep things half-done.

100
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,557
I thought I'd give you a lasting good news when I'm back to full health!

101
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:09,588
I hope you're happy.

102
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,339
Very.

103
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:18,092
Very happy to see you... So happy my eyes...

104
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:22,920
Are brimming with happiness...

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Adam!

106
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,371
Good to see you like this again, Mr Malik.

107
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:51,280
I don't remember thanking another man in my life.

108
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,110
But Adam's the only one who's been there for me.

109
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,010
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

110
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,788
You're embarrassing me...

111
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,240
I don't mean to...

112
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,493
I want you to be proud.

113
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,490
Right now, I'd just need your blessings...

114
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,302
Come. Everyone's waiting for you.

115
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:25,132
I'll be back in a while... Something came up.

116
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:28,920
Take care. Congratulations.
-See you. Thank you so much!

117
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,631
Why've you stopped it? Let's get back to it!
-Yeah, c'mon!

118
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,658
What are you looking at?
-Nothing...

119
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,988
Not you, at least...

120
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,151
Just looking at your shawl...

121
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,770
Gotta say, it's powerful...

122
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,410
Pleases the Lord when on your head...

123
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,820
And when you lower your gaze...

124
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,070
And your voice... And soften your tone...

125
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:46,718
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry would testify to your purity.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,878
Oh...

127
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:58,510
I wish I knew this before...

128
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,737
But it's too late for me...

129
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:07,390
I wish I could cover myself up like you...

130
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,950
But it's too late for me...

131
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,900
What are you saying?
-Oh, I wouldn't dare...

132
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,150
I won't even dare wish and think...

133
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,160
Bless you two... Adam and you...

134
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,862
Please, Mr Khan...

135
00:13:05,258 --> 00:13:12,758
Eyes used to staring and commanding don't deserve to be lowered like that!

136
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:19,474
Or is it that you've conceded defeat before the battle's even begun?

137
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,129
You know I haven't.
-Okay...

138
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:30,360
I didn't know you lowered your gaze when you've won.

139
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,860
First time I heard that.

140
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,578
I'm lowering my eyes...

141
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,938
So your rebellious eyes...

142
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:45,441
And my fury...

143
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:49,340
Doesn't defeat my restraint!

144
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,999
Because I value your life more than my victory.

145
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,718
You couldn't -- Give my son -- Your name -- Could you?

146
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,989
I don't think you've got the time to have tea now, yes?

147
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,398
Hey, Adam! Adam!

148
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,090
Where are you off to?

149
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:52,140
Home?

150
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,789
Doesn't look like it.

151
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,080
What do you mean?
-You left your place way behind.

152
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,129
Thanks.

153
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,163
Dad... I just prayed for one miracle all this time...

154
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:31,249
That you get better...

155
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,570
Bless you, my girl...

156
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Honestly...

157
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,050
I never believed it before...

158
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,668
But when you don't get what you wish for...

159
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:57,790
And you're drowning in helplessness...

160
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,748
Sometimes...

161
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:04,579
Grasping at the straws does indeed help...

162
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,908
Every time I saw a falling star...

163
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:12,188
I prayed for your health.

164
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,779
Thank you. All of you.

165
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:22,860
Where's Zulaikha? Why isn't she here to celebrate?

166
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,498
She's too surprised...

167
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,027
Too happy...

168
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,460
Like too much grief...

169
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,410
Too much happiness can be... Crippling...

170
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,208
I'll see her in a while.

171
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,080
I'll get Roshni...
-No.

172
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,957
I'll see her in a while too.

173
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,488
Mehek!

174
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,588
Why are you standing there?
-Good to see you back.

175
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,388
Good to see you too.

176
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,788
What is it?

177
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,120
Nothing?

178
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,968
What happened to those bright eyes?

179
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,270
Why do I see worry in there instead?

180
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,817
It's nothing like that...

181
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:12,173
It better <i>be</i> nothing like that.

182
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,030
If there's something - or some<i>one</i> - bothering you... Just let me know.

183
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:25,020
Malik Jr's back from sick leave...

184
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,140
Sickness dares not change him one bit...

185
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,520
Care to knock?

186
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,080
No!

187
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,740
I don't care about anything...

188
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,900
Except plucking every thorn in Mr Khan's side!

189
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,361
Try me. I'm right here.

190
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,613
How dare you?

191
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:04,833
I'll show you!

192
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:09,530
What happened?

193
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,850
Feel weak yet?

194
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,121
I'll divorce your sister!

195
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:17,111
How?

196
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:22,909
Gonna scream it in your dying voice? Write it down with a bloodied hand?

197
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,650
I'll do the same with Masooma!

198
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,218
Get it?

199
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,178
Now get out!

200
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,121
Yeah, I'm leaving for the courthouse.

201
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,478
Hmm...

202
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,174
Divorce, yeah...

203
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,610
I need the papers for a divorce...

204
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,008
Yeah, it's urgent.

205
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,628
Yeah, I'm coming.

206
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,248
For Mehek?

207
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,523
Yeah.

208
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,079
What about you?

209
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,409
I just want some peace...

210
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,490
How'd you get it?

211
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,218
By seeing everyone happy.

212
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:49,480
What about your happiness?
-I just told you...

213
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,920
I'd be happy to see everyone happy.
-No, Adam...

214
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,080
The one who's spent his life making everyone happy...

215
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,446
Deserves happiness more than the rest of them.

216
00:21:03,446 --> 00:21:05,987
Pray for me, then...

217
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,410
Pray that the Lord does what's best for me.

218
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,221
Pray for me, will you?

219
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,410
Guddi?

220
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,117
What?

221
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,201
I want to see her.

222
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,668
Why?

223
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:51,849
You don't know how much it hurts to hear a 'why' from a son who never said anything but 'yes'.

224
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,979
I'll tell Munna to introduce you to her.
-And yes...

225
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:08,300
Never forget that my son is more than just a caring heart and a shoulder to cry on.

226
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,997
I won't let anyone's tears curse the man that he is.

227
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,348
Take care.

228
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,630
Behold...

229
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:37,090
What light from yonder window breaks...

230
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,750
It is the east...

231
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,960
And Guddi is the sun.

232
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,572
And so I rise to welcome the day...

233
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:51,261
Why are you doing this?

234
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,111
Get used to it.

235
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,995
You've got to listen to my compliments all your life.

236
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,568
Just give me some time...

237
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,160
Your ears, your hands...

238
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,880
Have been so lonely...

239
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,600
I'll get you some earrings and bangles tomorrow.

240
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,182
Lovely kid, by the way.

241
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:29,250
Go.

242
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,861
I'll be coming in a sec.

243
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,868
I'll get going...
-Gotta say...

244
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:44,680
Your husband is -- <i>was</i> -- so unfortunate...

245
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,711
In his place...

246
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:52,520
I would've stood up against the Reaper...

247
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,470
Had it come to take me away from you.

248
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,092
I'd never have left you...

249
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,157
Step aside.

250
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,680
Too coy...

251
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:19,168
Sometimes, it feels like it wouldn't suit anyone else...

252
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:53,525
Just give me the order and I'll divorce her and take the kids away.

253
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,958
I'd gladly --

254
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,738
No.

255
00:25:01,388 --> 00:25:03,458
Not just yet...

256
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:09,178
My daughter's life is at stake.

257
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,462
Go.

258
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,687
There!

259
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:22,889
Bless you, Asher Khan.
-Thank you for giving me your time, Reverend.

260
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:29,969
I had a feeling you're going to need me last night...

261
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:36,129
Who knows, I might've called you in a while myself...

262
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,128
I'm in awe of your powers.

263
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:43,479
So, what is it that worries you?

264
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,142
First time I'm --

265
00:26:46,142 --> 00:26:48,911
Afraid...

266
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,359
Because --

267
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,510
The one who never dared to look me in the eye...

268
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,860
Is now poised to pounce on me like a lion!

269
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,781
He doesn't fear anything now... Says my daughter will be widowed... Or divorced...

270
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:11,510
He says it like he means it...

271
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,608
God forgive him!

272
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:23,358
Don't worry, Asher Khan... I'm with you. Or is it that you no longer believe I can do anything?

273
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:28,778
I need your help, Reverend.

274
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:35,718
I got my little girl married off to him because you said so. Only you can help me.

275
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:41,970
Don't worry. Everything will be fine... I'll be back in a week...

276
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,778
What if it's too late? What if he --

277
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:47,039
God forgive you...

278
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:55,230
You have turned to disbelief in every way, Asher Khan.

279
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,738
It's a long way down.

280
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:02,298
No, Reverend...

281
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:05,107
I'm relieved to hear it...

282
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,938
Thank you...

283
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,447
Can't believe you got that little girl married off! How cruel!

284
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,290
It'd be cruel if a saint did it...

285
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,958
Cruelty is but a habit for some of us...

286
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:33,870
The only thing I can't believe is it's his own daughter...

287
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,030
You've got daughters too!

288
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,666
Don't you dare say another word!

289
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:41,440
You better mind your tongue.

290
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:50,170
I can bludgeon you with the silverware I just brought you if I wanted!

291
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:59,630
What a shame it'd be if they heard your powers couldn't even save you from your own wife!

292
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm sorry... Just got a bit angry because you mentioned my girl...

293
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:17,320
Maybe next time, you could try drowning your anger in a glass of water, chanting your deceptive spells, and gulping it down!

294
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,665
Keep your voice down... What if one of my disciples heard it?

295
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:27,180
How dare you shut me up?

296
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:35,400
Just pray you never face someone who can see right through you! It'll be your end!

297
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,361
For God's sake... Keep your voice down!

298
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:41,953
I'm doing all of this for you!

299
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:45,414
So you can live comfortably...

300
00:29:45,414 --> 00:29:51,640
Were you out of options that you chose this deceptive trickery in the guise of a saint?

301
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,775
What could I do?

302
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:57,699
I remember how hard I worked...

303
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,790
As a labourer...

304
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,380
As a driver...

305
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,327
Served people with loyalty...

306
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:15,938
Served people who'd give me what I deserved like they were doing a favour!

307
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,090
And...

308
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,948
That's when I decided...

309
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:23,930
To take my share..

310
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,808
Of their riches...

311
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:33,139
Fear. That's the only thing that you can deal in.

312
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:36,519
Make them fear...

313
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,990
Make them feel helpless... Don't let them make head or tail of it...

314
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,540
Tell the mighty their downfall awaits them...

315
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,170
Tell the wealthy...

316
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,090
They're about to be broke...

317
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,691
Have your men as their servants...

318
00:30:56,691 --> 00:31:00,092
So you know everything...

319
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:05,112
Add 'Reverend' to your name...

320
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:07,830
Look the part...

321
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,748
Move out... And live a good life...

322
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,908
But aye...

323
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:15,590
Keep praying for me...

324
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:24,990
I fear that one day I'd be facing someone who can see right through me... It'll be the end of me!

325
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,538
His Highness is here.

326
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:33,468
Tell him I'll be coming in a second...

327
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,601
Get my lunch ready... I'll be back...

328
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:41,501
Another coward's here for my help...

329
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,570
I'll be back...

330
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,760
Shahmir!

331
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,841
Munna!

332
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,987
Go.

333
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,360
Munna! Water!

334
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,627
Aye, Mr Malik!

335
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,248
Mum?

336
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:56,158
Mum? What happened?

337
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,347
Mum?

338
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,211
What is it?
-No idea. Heard something break inside...

339
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,801
What happened, Dad? Heard something break...

340
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,790
It's nothing...

341
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:22,383
The glass slipped from Munna's hand...

342
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,160
Fell and broke...

343
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,490
That's all.

344
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,240
Don't worry, Mehek...

345
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,478
Go.

346
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:41,628
Okay.

347
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,750
I -- I'll get another...
-No!

348
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,098
Just. Go.

349
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,200
Whatever happens, do not come near my room.

350
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,209
Yeah?

351
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:57,469
I need a few things. Right now.

352
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,269
Order me.

353
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,328
Sure. On my way.

354
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,740
Munna!

355
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,238
Here!

356
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:18,039
Yeah?

357
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,920
I'm so worried... I want to see Shahmir... Hold him again...

358
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,747
Please bring him here.
-Just a sec.

359
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,090
Here...

360
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,850
The best coal I could find...

361
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,822
And the strongest rope...

362
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,150
I expected no less.

363
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,787
I wouldn't dare turn you down.

364
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,937
What'd you do with it?

365
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:10,408
Tie things?

366
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,028
Of course.

367
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,478
I'm gonna tie something too...

368
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:19,540
And...

369
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,340
What'd you do with coal?

370
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,086
Light a fire?
-Aye...

371
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:29,258
That's what I'm gonna do too...

372
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,688
But why?

373
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,420
Don't worry...

374
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,730
I'm not gonna burn your sister...

375
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,840
Go back to the estate and call me...

376
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,070
I'll tell you what's next...

377
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay.

378
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
