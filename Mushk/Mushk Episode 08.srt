1
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:44,528
I don't have the courage to hear you turn me down...

2
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:51,800
So... Should I ask for it?

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,650
I hold you in the highest regard, Mr Malik.

4
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,038
It'd be an insult to my respect to hear you ask me for something.

5
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,130
Well, then... I say...

6
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,187
Marry my Mehek.

7
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,480
Sir?

8
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:30,630
I can't tell you how I've gathered the courage to say it...

9
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,261
His name's Shayan. Studied with me at University. Yeah... We got married...

10
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,998
Aren't you happy to hear me say it?
-No...

11
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,750
No... I mean, I didn't mean... Like... 'No'...

12
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,360
It's just... I didn't expect you'd...

13
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:06,158
My age and my relation to Mehek won't let me talk to your family about your marriage...

14
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,938
But...

15
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:15,578
I'm sure you can ask them to come here with a proposal.

16
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,460
But... So suddenly...

17
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,658
Is everything alright, Mr Malik?

18
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,019
Of course.

19
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,901
Everything's good...

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,496
Just... It isn't the right time...

21
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,248
I need your help...

22
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:49,850
And you have the right to refuse...

23
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,380
But everything would be fine if you accepted it...

24
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,181
Did you ask Mehek?

25
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,590
She won't have a problem.

26
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,277
Give me a day.

27
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:10,467
I'll see you tomorrow.

28
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,830
I...

29
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,888
I'll take my leave...

30
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:16,828
Good night...

31
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,156
I've got word at last...

32
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:40,210
Shayan's Uncle... Asher Khan... Lives in Rajanpore...

33
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:48,868
I don't know... But I got a feeling Shayan's somewhere there...

34
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,010
Please do me a favour...

35
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,872
Find him...

36
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,140
A million people live there, Mehek...

37
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,720
It won't be so easy...

38
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,600
It isn't impossible either...

39
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,508
Please...

40
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:11,298
Please... For me?

41
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,207
Do you have a picture?

42
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:18,647
Yeah... I do... On my phone...

43
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:20,438
Here...

44
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:23,820
Any other?

45
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,507
Any other?
-Yeah... This one... Look... Here...

46
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:30,109
Yeah... This one... Look... Here...

47
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,716
Send them to me.

48
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,991
But what'd Mr Malik just tell me?

49
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:43,182
I'll talk to you later...
-But -- Hey!

50
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,410
Mum!

51
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,129
What are you doing?

52
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,409
You out of your mind?

53
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:15,840
What happened, Mum?

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:24,322
I told you... Parents' Day at our school. I'm playing the bride in this drama...

55
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,760
Ah, yes...

56
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,210
I forgot...

57
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,401
I thought...

58
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,490
What?

59
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,300
Nothing...

60
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,090
Seeing you like this after all this time...

61
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,420
Felt... Nice...

62
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,927
You look good...

63
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,129
He's here...

64
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,388
Tauqir!

65
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,664
Give him something nice to wear.

66
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:45,250
Give <i>him</i> something too... He's an old friend...

67
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,792
I'd hate it if he didn't join in the celebration.

68
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,760
Get ready.

69
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,688
Close the door.

70
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,580
Put it on...

71
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,620
Or... You'll catch a cold...

72
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,868
Brr... It kills me...

73
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,538
Starve yourself...

74
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:36,710
If you think that's gonna make him come back to you, be my guest.

75
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,880
Ever thought how your mother would feel if she saw you like this?

76
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,890
He's not cheating on me...

77
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,028
I'm sure he has his reasons...

78
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:55,360
That's your pure and innocent heart shutting up your mind and speaking out.

79
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,508
It's shutting your ears!

80
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,400
He called me.

81
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,348
What'd he say?

82
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,758
He refused.

83
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,630
He said...

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,520
'We're just friends'!

85
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,450
I begged him... I pleaded with him not to ruin my daughter's life...

86
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,521
But he said he doesn't want to say anything else and hung up.

87
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,188
Mum...

88
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,620
No...
-Calm down...

89
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,480
That's not like him, Mum... I know he's not like that!
-There, now... Come.

90
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,327
Come with me...

91
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,830
Sit down.

92
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,531
No need to show the respect you clearly don't have...

93
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:37,412
Getting up won't prove that you respect me one bit...

94
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:41,643
How do I prove it, Grandpa?

95
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:49,843
You'll tell me the truth when I ask something...

96
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:55,029
And do as I say.

97
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,610
So...

98
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,640
Was he here to see you?

99
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,530
I swear by you...

100
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:12,160
I swear by my late parents... No!

101
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,611
Then you should have no problem in doing what I ask you to...
-Your wish is my command.

102
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:21,381
I've decided to get you married...

103
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,801
I've decided to get you married to Adam.

104
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,400
If you can bring yourself to it...

105
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,599
Save my last breaths, my last moments...

106
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,440
From disgrace.

107
00:10:53,750 --> 00:11:01,260
Anyone in your place - including me - would've found it difficult to believe me...

108
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,290
Anyone would've thought I'm lying. But...

109
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,660
Sometimes, a bit of hope is all you need to go on. And I can see you desperately need it.

110
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:19,417
I'm sure you can see I ain't giving you <i>just</i> a bit of hope! I'm giving you your life.

111
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,887
Believe what?

112
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,374
Your Mam's lying.

113
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,381
Shut up!

114
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,380
Ie... Anyone would've shut me up...

115
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:40,481
But when someone so close is trampling your happiness under her feet...

116
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:44,139
And family ties blind you to everything...

117
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,480
But someone else tries to open your eyes... It is quite natural to shut her up!

118
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,068
Give me his number.

119
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:57,939
If I couldn't see right through him in a moment, I'll shut up for the rest of my life!

120
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,720
So?

121
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,962
Welcome back, m'boy! How are you?

122
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,191
Everyone kills time when waiting... But waiting for you nearly killed me!

123
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:34,411
Look... They've all been waiting to welcome you!

124
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:35,801
Come.

125
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,811
Welcome.

126
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:40,722
How are you, Shayan? Bless you.

127
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:44,192
How was the journey?
-Great...

128
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:51,000
Come. Your sister's waiting for you... You're in for a real feast!

129
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,330
Welcome, Mr Khan.
-How are you, sir?

130
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,551
Mehek?

131
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,250
What happened?

132
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,600
Aren't you happy to see me?

133
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,031
How could I be anything but happy to see you?

134
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:34,132
I'm just asking because I can't believe my eyes.

135
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:37,772
Is Adam around?
-He's in his room.

136
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,960
From my earliest days...

137
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,770
My youth...

138
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,380
To my waning...

139
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,040
Wrinkled state now...

140
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:25,620
I don't remember apologising to anyone for my biggest sins...

141
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,410
Not truly, at least...

142
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,550
But today... I apologise from the core of my heart...

143
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,060
To you... And to myself.

144
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,770
I know why only too well...

145
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,950
But I wonder why you're apologising to yourself.

146
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:09,360
My worry for you gave me sleepless nights all this time...

147
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,020
I don't know how many lies I had to tell myself to comfort me...

148
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,720
I'm sorry for all of that.

149
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,520
That's why...

150
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,810
I'm apologising to myself...

151
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,110
I've accepted it...

152
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,190
So you might as well...

153
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,000
Way to twist my arm!

154
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:49,478
A bit of arm-twisting's gonna save you from every trouble headed your way.

155
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,180
Think of it as a godsend,

156
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,387
And it'll ward off every fear, pain, and punishment...

157
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,821
What if I didn't?

158
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,480
Good one.

159
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,110
What if I'm serious?

160
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:34,720
Let's just say your death's gonna give me sleepless nights...

161
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,949
C'mon... Enjoy the feast!

162
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,570
Adam...

163
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,360
Mehek?

164
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,770
Please, sit.

165
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,153
You didn't tell me what Grandpa asked you to do.

166
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:12,031
I felt it was more important to listen to you...

167
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,480
Mind if I ask you something?
-Go on.

168
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,620
Do you ever get punished for being innocent?

169
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,040
May I ask you something?

170
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,360
Sure...

171
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,577
After telling me...

172
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,400
Happiness can be very high-headed...

173
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,441
Before coming in, it likes to make sure you've paid its price by suffering enough...

174
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,751
May God will that is so...

175
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,192
What is it?

176
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:11,510
Why is life more harsh on me than my feeble heart can take?

177
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,742
Feeble hearts need someone's mercy to beat.

178
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:19,220
It pleases the Lord when they do...

179
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,710
And He is fair and just.

180
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:29,300
He doesn't want to leave them without reason to be rewarded on the Day of Judgement.

181
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,900
That is why He tests them by going harsh on them.

182
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,100
And the Doomsday we live to see in this world?

183
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,521
It'll be the day we are rewarded...

184
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,912
It's just... Trying times...

185
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,390
Jesus... Just how...

186
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,378
Just how do I face everything?

187
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:05,908
I've been trying to gather the courage to turn Grandpa down, but it slips from between my fingers like grains of sand...

188
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:14,587
Okay... I'll just text him a 'no' and leave this place for no less than a year... I can't live here...

189
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,348
You'd leave me alone?

190
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,459
I can't help it, Mehek.

191
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:26,429
Won't you stand by me?

192
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,450
When'd I say that?

193
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,161
What do you want?

194
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,820
Just say yes...

195
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,460
You're married to someone. How can you get married to me?

196
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,330
You've just got to say yes... Because if you don't... He'll get me married to someone else...

197
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,100
What happened, Mehek?

198
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:05,958
Someone... Someone came to see Roshni... But Aunt blamed me! I have nothing to do with it!

199
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,861
Halt! Mr Khan's orders!

200
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,420
Javed! Hanif!

201
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,150
What orders?

202
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:42,471
Mr Khan asked me to stop you if you set foot where you are, threaten you if you didn't stop...

203
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:49,630
Aim for the head if you didn't listen, and shoot you the moment you took a step out the gate.

204
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:59,930
It'd pain me, sir, but no pain would let me disobey Mr Khan. I'd pull the trigger.

205
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:05,138
Okay... Have it your way...

206
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:31,720
That's why I want you to talk to your Mum... Come over with a proposal before I'm married off somewhere else...

207
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,120
Adam!
-Yeah?

208
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,570
Mum wants to see you.

209
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,810
I'll be back.

210
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,660
Don't worry. I'll be waiting...

211
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,781
You don't know how much you've delighted everyone here!

212
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:02,050
What do you mean?

213
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,020
I heard the thing about the proposal.

214
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,838
Hey!

215
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:15,498
Blimey, are you coy!

216
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:35,820
I'm sure Aunt's shamed and disgraced tears would calm the wildfire craving for revenge a bit if Roshni eloped with her lover!

217
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,280
But first, I need to get to him!

218
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,140
Didn't even smile.
-Got anything better?
-Just poor jokes, I tell you!
-Lemme tell you about --

219
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,979
You know the bank 'round here? I went there with some money...
-Okay, back to the game, mates...
-Aye...

220
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,260
Hello?

221
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,670
Wow... You sound as pure as a mother's love for her son...

222
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,797
Who is it?

223
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:23,049
Someone who's witnessed tears in Roshni's eyes.

224
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,070
Who?

225
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,457
A friend.

226
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:29,738
Why aren't you taking her call?

227
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:32,580
Why do I need to tell you?
-You don't.

228
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,618
Just listen to what I say.

229
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:38,928
One, she's about to commit suicide and I'm stopping her.

230
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,128
What?

231
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:46,289
You heard me. Now, don't answer if you get a call from her number. Her Mam calls you to check.

232
00:23:46,289 --> 00:23:50,870
And why should I believe you?
-Your problem. Figure it out.

233
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:56,461
Just take my call. I've kept Roshni alive on half-truths and white lies.

234
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:57,572
How's she?

235
00:23:57,572 --> 00:24:00,882
Take my call and she'll be fine.

236
00:24:01,592 --> 00:24:02,943
Hello?

237
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,584
Hello?

238
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,701
Her lover's asking about his love... It's gonna be a doddle, it is!

239
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,892
Yeah? Who is it?

240
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,628
Where's Mehek?

241
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:40,730
Mehek? I think I lost her somewhere in my scarf. Mind taking a look?

242
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:46,285
What are you saying?
-No, seriously! Take a look! C'mon! Here!

243
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,621
Always lookin' for Mehek!

244
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,210
Where are you going? Mehek!

245
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,698
Home.

246
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:13,239
'Far as I know, home's that way!

247
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,648
Oh yeah...

248
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:22,397
Sorry...

249
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,671
I hope Grandpa didn't ask about me.
-He did.

250
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:37,571
What?
-He asked where you were. I told him you were up in your room.

251
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,160
Thank you.

252
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,180
Anytime.

253
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,170
I've been thinking why my daughter had to go through all of that...

254
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,622
When I realised that she'd seen nothing yet...

255
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:02,038
But not now... She's safe now...

256
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:10,808
What if he'd cheated on you after you got married?

257
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,243
I can't understand anything...

258
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:23,350
I've got this sinking feeling... I'm restless...

259
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,410
Just... Don't do anything that'd disgrace me.

260
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,450
Just accept whatever match Grandpa finds for you,

261
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:37,000
Or you'll taint both my honour and my upbringing in one stroke. It'd kill me!

262
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,371
And it'd bury me alive!

263
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:42,201
I'm your mother...

264
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:46,330
God always listens to mothers.

265
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,491
I'm sure He'll do something for you.

266
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,770
If He listens to mothers...

267
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,230
Pray that Saqib comes back.

268
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,681
I did.

269
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:06,116
But it was never heard because it was not good for you.

270
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,772
Mum!

271
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,208
What are you doing?

272
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,990
Please don't taint my honour...

273
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,481
Do as Grandpa says...

274
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,517
Water...

275
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,914
Wa -- Water... You -- Tyrants...

276
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,978
W --

277
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,450
Any --

278
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,280
Dry...

279
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,538
W -- Water...

280
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,788
Water...

281
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,460
W -- Water...

282
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,290
Bloody -- Tyrants...

283
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,930
Water...

284
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,198
W --

285
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:44,418
All -- Dry...

286
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,951
Please...

287
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,440
Any -- One...

288
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,070
Mum...

289
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,391
Mum!

290
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,300
Mum!

291
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,290
What happened?

292
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,630
Nothing... Back to sleep...

293
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,040
Please tell me.

294
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,230
I don't know...

295
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,440
I just felt so... Restless...

296
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,563
I feel like we're about to hear some very bad news...

297
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:05,554
I've felt this way once...

298
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:09,867
Your Grandpa passed away back then...

299
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,760
It's nothing... I'm with you...

300
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,420
Don't worry...

301
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,681
Lie down...

302
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,758
Easy there...

303
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:29,450
M -- Mum...
-There, now... Easy...

304
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,320
O Lord...

305
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,530
Hey! Get up and have something!

306
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,831
You heard me?

307
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,040
I'm keeping it here...

308
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,951
He'll have it when he gets up...

309
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,930

Sir...

339
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,861
Adam's here to see you, sir.

340
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:05,740
Send him in.
-Okay.

341
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,200
And... We'd both like some tea.

342
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,068
Sure.

343
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,410
Come in, Adam.

344
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,550
Good morning.

345
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,101
'Morning.

346
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,711
Take a seat.

347
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,382
After you.

348
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,761
How are you?

349
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:48,641
Same as you left me.

350
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,250
Still waiting for your reply...

351
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,930
Yeah... About that...

352
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,031
Well, Mr Malik...
-Wait...

353
00:36:01,031 --> 00:36:02,040
Wait...

354
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,310
If you're here to refuse...

355
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,450
Don't say anything.

356
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,662
In fact, don't mention it at all...

357
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:15,490
Just... Talk about anything else...

358
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,451
Have a cuppa, and leave...

359
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,170
I've never heard you turn me down.

360
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:32,140
I fear my head may bow down in disappointment.

361
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,000
No, Mr Malik...

362
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,771
I haven't come here to refuse.

363
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,700
I'm here to tell you that your wait's over.

364
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,000
Mum will be here with the proposal in the evening.

365
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
