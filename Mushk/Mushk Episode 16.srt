1
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,627
What's the matter?

2
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:40,717
Untie me and I'll untie you.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,969
Naw, mate... I can't do it...

4
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,840
I can't even untie myself...

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,060
Wait... Lemme help you first...

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,018
D'you know why we've kept <i>you</i> with them?

7
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:19,528
I tried to run away...
-Nah, ain't that...

8
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:24,918
You broke out before... Came back too...

9
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:37,330
I've chained the good Samaritan in you who would've helped them break free, whether you like it or not.

10
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:48,580
To the devil with them... I just saw the gun in his hand... Thought it's like the movies... A knight here to save his princess...

11
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,853
It's not like I really saw <i>you</i> as villains! Remember that actor bloke?

12
00:01:55,853 --> 00:02:04,820
He told me that everyone comes here to play the knights... They only become villains if they're forced to...

13
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,457
I thought I'd help the knight...

14
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:12,548
I've told you the truth...

15
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:18,730
Please untie me... I've got this awful itch in my head...

16
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,340
Well, guess what, without the villains...

17
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:35,370
The knights can do little besides play with the kids or get the groceries...

18
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,178
Speaking of which...

19
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:45,697
The knights are as heroic as their villains evil!

20
00:02:46,310 --> 00:03:00,100
But in the legend of Ruby... There's just this great villain who's got the puny knight chained and helpless!

21
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,638
Madame!

22
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,558
C'mon, now...

23
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,838
Move back...

24
00:04:03,913 --> 00:04:05,883
Back...

25
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,888
Quick!
-How?

26
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:29,308
Untie me! Quick!

27
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,918
You're sending her to school?

28
00:04:39,388 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah...

29
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,688
She's got an exam today...

30
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,982
Look at yourself...

31
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,909
She's about to get married...

32
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:05,440
Instead of getting the girl ready for her marriage... You're sending her off to school!

33
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,689
It's your responsibility too, just in case!

34
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:11,529
Thank goodness...

35
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,220
You don't normally think this way, but...

36
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,868
Thank goodness you said she's just a girl.

37
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,511
Shut up and get me breakfast.

38
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,977
No one's going anywhere.

39
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,217
Get her dressed properly.

40
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,578
Hello?

41
00:05:55,578 --> 00:06:00,210
You're so fake!
-I'm as real as it gets in love.

42
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,790
You lost your mind?

43
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,271
When you asked me to hold your hand...

44
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:09,761
My eyes were fixed on you.

45
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:13,402
I lost my mind the moment I saw your beauty...

46
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:17,011
You might even find it lying 'round there...

47
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:22,001
Don't prolong this scene with another monologue.

48
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:26,951
Now, listen to this... The thorn on our side is the reason we get to see each other.

49
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:30,530
Don't let her know her new worth.

50
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:37,068
Give her husband what'll cure him... Not what'll kill him! He'll cure her himself!

51
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:44,500
And... Get back to work... Don't mourn losing your mind. I can give you a piece of mine if you want.

52
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,318
Got it.

53
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,021
Untie me!

54
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:00,181
Hey!

55
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,761
Where are you off to?

56
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,151
Shut up!
-Untie me and --

57
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:08,332
There's no better time to run away! For God's sake, untie me!

58
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:10,344
Please... Untie us...

59
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:16,984
You off your head? Because I'm not... Not most of the time, at least...

60
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:25,060
You want me to set you free so you can get away with your girl while Madame Ruby eats me alive?

61
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,070
Or d'you want me to come with you?

62
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,210
For the love of God, just do me a favour and help me? Please?

63
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,740
Favours will be rewarded on the Day of Judgement. I don't care about anything that won't help me now.
-Please... You're a woman too!

64
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,400
That's precisely why, genius! I'll go tell her I had the chance, but didn't run away!

65
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,490
She'll appreciate it... And reward me! Ta ta!
-Untie me! Hey!

66
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,248
You can't do that! I helped you because you said you'll help me! Hey! Wait!

67
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,538
Anyone there?

68
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Aliya?

69
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,938
Aliya?

70
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,718
Anyone around here?
-Mum... What happened?

71
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:34,839
What is it?
-Aliya...

72
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:38,190
I just saw her in my dream...
-Who?

73
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,888
Roshni!

74
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:43,928
There's this lake... She's drowning...

75
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:50,150
And they're all watching her beg for help...

76
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,518
They're laughing at it... Enjoying it...
-Mum...

77
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,328
My girl...

78
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,288
Madame...

79
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,378
Madame Ruby?

80
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,418
Madame R --

81
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,219
God forgive me...

82
00:10:55,798 --> 00:11:00,829
I made such a big mistake... A grave mistake...

83
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,320
Please don't punish me like this...
-You've made a mistake...

84
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,700
A mistake...

85
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,858
That we're all being punished for...

86
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:19,188
Grandpa...

87
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:21,727
Had a heart attack...

88
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,588
Change of plans.

89
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:45,580
Now I've got the money... And Madame Ruby's jewellery! I'm open do do any favours I can!

90
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,461
So, what would you have me do?
-Just untie me...

91
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:52,630
And guess what...

92
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,348
I got your gun too!

93
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,879
Untie my hands... Yeah...

94
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,958
C'mon!

95
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,800
Where d'you think you're going? I'll fix you!

96
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,611
Get off her!

97
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,579
Quick!
-C'mon!

98
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,250
Stop them! Guards!

99
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,930
Guards! Where are you?

100
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,360
Guards!

101
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,430
What the --

102
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,240
No!

103
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,861
Jesus...

104
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,452
Get up! Get up, you morons!

105
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,958
Outside!

106
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,188
Here.

107
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,250
Come!

108
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,328
What th --

109
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,748
No! Hold your fire!

110
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:07,090
You let them get away! Useless, incompetent morons!

111
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,751
Double time!

112
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,412
Faster!

113
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,808
Just a sec!

114
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,881
Other side! Get in!

115
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,990
♪ <i>Some say I'm Guddi...</i> ♪

116
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,750
(Humming 'Some say I'm a sweetie')

117
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,210
First time I've taken a U-turn...

118
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,769
I don't normally change my mind, Dr Guddi!

119
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,795
I'd die if I heard that again...
-Please don't talk about dying...

120
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:49,440
Don't get on my bad side, okay?
-But you are on the bad side...

121
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,768
Ehh? What?

122
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:57,820
You're on the good side and the bad side... I don't see anyone else!

123
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,770
Go, now...
-Huh?

124
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,958
Don't let Madame suspect there isn't even her shadow on your heart...

125
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,019
Ah, yes... Okay... I'll get going.

126
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,839
Dr Guddi!

127
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,018
Shayan!

128
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,411
The Reverend will be here today.

129
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:50,491
You're getting married on the day he picks.

130
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,748
Congratulations to you.

131
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,918
Congratulations to you too.

132
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,249
Be done with it now, okay?

133
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,440
We're twice as close now...

134
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,629
You're also gonna be my son-in-law.

135
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,830
Tauqir!

136
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,148
I got you these suits.

137
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:33,131
Pick your favourite.

138
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,909
Show him, Tauqir.

139
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,898
Try the other one.

140
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,938
Ah!

141
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,679
They're all yours. Keep the ones you like.

142
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,950
I like this one.

143
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,098
Show him the rest.

144
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,808
Gotta say, you're clever...

145
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,000
You had your car ready!

146
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,378
You planned for everything, didn't you? Anyway... Who's she to you?

147
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,708
Ah, yes...

148
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:15,949
And... I nicked this phone on the way...

149
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,920
Just switched it on...

150
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,600
Wanted to see what kind of a man you are...

151
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,323
Looks like it's locked...

152
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,624
Someone's calling...

153
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,184
Hello?
-Thank God! Hello? Adam?

154
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,538
Thank God! Hello? Adam?

155
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:40,600
First time I've prayed since my GCSEs!

156
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:50,030
But I'm glad now... I thought the Lord wouldn't hear me after everything I've done... I guess they're right after all... Wish sincerely and He gives...

157
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,280
What'd you ask for?
-Your phone switching on, and your voice reaching my ears.

158
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,391
You know me inside out, you know I know you inside out.

159
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,860
Why don't you just say it?

160
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,478
When you start caring for someone, he ought to know you need something.

161
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:11,350
What d'you want?
-Just told you. I wanted to hear your voice.

162
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,608
I know my heart inside out.

163
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:18,263
It's gonna want to see you. And I know the trick...

164
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,823
I'm gonna get back to praying that you come back!

165
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:43,248
We're at the bus station. We part ways here. Take care.
-Thank you.

166
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:06,431
I've called out to you fifty times in the last thirty minutes.

167
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:09,849
But you don't say a word...

168
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:12,738
Not even 'hmm' me...

169
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,358
Zulaikha...

170
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,878
Guria...

171
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,058
Mehek...
-What happened?

172
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,560
Not a word from Adam all night... No idea where he is...

173
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:00,401
I said I got to clean the room... If Mum saw me crying, she'll ask why...

174
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:05,341
She'd be distressed if she found out...

175
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,970
His phone's switched on!

176
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,418
Why don't you take it?

177
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,211
Hello?

178
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,871
Where are you?

179
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,782
On my way.

180
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,741
On your way where?

181
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:39,730
Home.

182
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,656
Got anything?

183
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,376
Yeah.

184
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,698
What?

185
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,827
I'm coming back with my promise.

186
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:55,847
What? She's with you?

187
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:58,868
Yeah. Right here.

188
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,367
Could I talk to her?

189
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,468
Here.

190
00:21:04,778 --> 00:21:06,858
It's Mehek.

191
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,710
H -- Hello?

192
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,141
You alright?

193
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,740
Don't know...

194
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,228
I just know I'm coming back...

195
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,963
I'm very scared... Mum will kill me...

196
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:38,380
No one will say anything... Just... Get back here quick...

197
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,480
Before we're all disgraced before everyone.

198
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,338
We're on our way.

199
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:51,828
Give Adam the phone.
-Okay.

200
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,585
Yeah?

201
00:21:56,376 --> 00:22:05,910
I don't think we can ever pay back this favour...

202
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:12,333
But I pray all your dreams become your reality...

203
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:17,579
May He guard the honour of your family and your descendants...

204
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,250
May He give you everything you wish for...

205
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,470
However distant it may seem...

206
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,698
You know that can't happen...

207
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:30,259
Uhh...

208
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,448
I mean...

209
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:38,610
Once I've brought Roshni back...

210
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,387
I've got to take someone to her destination.

211
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:47,658
Please be ready. I am.

212
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,618
Take care.

213
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:54,918
Something you must see, Mehek!

214
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,179
I got to go home... Got something I must --
-Just a minute!

215
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,038
How d'you like these?
-Lovely... I'll have a look later... I gotta go. Bye!

216
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,520
Good Lord... So unfortunate...

217
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,058
She missed her chance to rejoice!

218
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,692
Have some water?

219
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:33,789
You didn't tell me how you got there.

220
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,618
Don't worry. It's between us.

221
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,929
Ah!

222
00:23:55,528 --> 00:24:02,160
I thought I'd grab your hand and stop you... But remembered I gotta ask for it...

223
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,268
It'd hurt me if you didn't let me...

224
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:14,728
So I thought I'd rather not grieve my heart when I can take a good look instead...

225
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:20,150
Talked to Madame?
-Tried my best.

226
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,619
Tried until I thought trying would hurt my ego.

227
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:30,649
That's when I came out... Don't worry... She'd call me any moment...

228
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,300
There!

229
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,412
Where are you?

230
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,339
Right here...

231
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,018
I'm sorry...

232
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:52,687
I've lost my mind ever since Roshni eloped... I can't think of anything...

233
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:58,559
Come here quick... I need you.

234
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,739
Okay.

235
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,428
What'd she say?

236
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:06,350
She says she...

237
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,954
'Needs' me!

238
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,315
Holy Mary... Bless you... Are you actually happy, or am I just seeing things?

239
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:23,305
You won't believe it!
-What?

240
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:29,810
Adam fulfilled his promise! He's found Roshni!

241
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,327
He's on his way.

242
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,428
I'm needed elsewhere...

243
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,150
Shh!

244
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,637
He's just dozed off! Don't disturb him!

245
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,445
Guess what! They've found Roshni!
-Great!

246
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,568
Good Lord...
-I'll go check...

247
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,628
Help us, O Lord...

248
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:54,818
He's helped us.
-What do you mean?

249
00:26:54,818 --> 00:27:02,159
The shroud of honour you'd woven all your life...

250
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,310
Has been saved...

251
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,417
What happened?

252
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:11,968
We've found Roshni!

253
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,879
Really?

254
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,770
You've been kind, my Lord...

255
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,008
Very kind indeed...

256
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,137
Thank You...

257
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,517
What happened?

258
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,700
Nothing.

259
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,378
I was washing the glass when it slipped...

260
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:50,221
But why are you crying?

261
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:55,069
Just my luck!
-What happened?

262
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,101
One of the glasses had to break by my hand!

263
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,941
The set won't be complete now...

264
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,340
I hate to see incomplete things...

265
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,618
Even if it's 5/6 of the way.

266
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,928
Move aside...

267
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,461
I gotta clean this?

268
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:29,069
By the Lord... I talked to Adam myself. Talked to Roshni too.

269
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:33,458
She's fine, isn't she? Where was she?

270
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,581
I was so happy I couldn't even think about asking...

271
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:44,521
I just ran to you the moment I heard it.

272
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,341
Aunt...

273
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,211
What does Dr Rana say?

274
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:53,651
Congratulations, Aunt...

275
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,680
The Lord saved us...

276
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:01,371
Swear you mean it...

277
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,401
I swear.

278
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,640
By?

279
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:10,723
By my love for Grandpa.

280
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:16,593
Call her... I want to talk to her.
-Right away...

281
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:29,959
Hello?
-Yeah, Adam?

282
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,490
Adam...

283
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,850
Where are you?
-On my way.

284
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:40,349
Where's Roshni?
-With me.

285
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,771
Could I talk to her?

286
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,680
Who is it?
-Your Mum.

287
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,489
Here. They're all so worried...

288
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,058
Roshni...

289
00:29:59,227 --> 00:30:01,337
My dear...

290
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:04,807
How are you?

291
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,037
For the love of God... Say something... Please...

292
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:19,930
For your Mum's sake... Please, say something...

293
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,268
Anything...

294
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:26,844
Why'd you have to give us this fright?

295
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:32,955
I'm sorry, Mum... I shouldn't have done it...

296
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,464
Just... Come back...

297
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:40,075
We're all waiting...

298
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,450
Reverend...

299
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,266
Reverend...

300
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,860
Your Holiness...

301
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,270
Hope you're fine.
-The Lord's blessed me...

302
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:31,519
And you, Asher Khan?
-Just whiling the days waiting for you.

303
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,998
Hope you had a great journey... Come in.
-Yeah, thank the Lord...

304
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:38,818
We've all been waiting...

305
00:31:51,340 --> 00:32:00,658
Good news, great news, and awful news that may kill you. But don't die just yet - you've got to kill. What do I start with?

306
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,620
Good news... And great news...

307
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,480
Been ages since I've been happy...

308
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,830
Good news first... You're gonna be fine soon.

309
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,939
I pray...

310
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:18,710
Great news... Adam's found Roshni. He's on his way.

311
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,470
Thank You, O God...

312
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,010
Thank You so much!
-Aww, please don't cry!

313
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:30,088
Save your tears for the bad news... 'Sec.

314
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,288
Now pay attention.

315
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:48,379
They didn't just intend to kill you... They'd half done it! Were it not for me seeing Dr Rana throw an empty vial and confirming my suspicions...

316
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,659
I won't forgive this betrayal...

317
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,738
I won't spare them!

318
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:04,388
Be my guest. But you got to get back on your feet first. Here.

319
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:23,199
Just a few more days... Keep stoking the flames within...

320
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,781
Munna!

321
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,208
Munna!

322
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,618
What are you doing here?

323
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:38,720
Dr Rana asked me to give him his pills.

324
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,147
Done?
-Yes.

325
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,864
Go.

326
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,228
Call Munna.
-Okay.

327
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:35,871
Why d'you want to drown our happiness and that of our children in your tears?

328
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:40,522
Don't mothers don't weep at their daughters' happiness?

329
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,444
So... Are you happy?

330
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:48,249
No.

331
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,781
First time you've said 'no' to me.

332
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:07,081
It was always about me...

333
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:10,230
But now...

334
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,551
It's about my daughter...

335
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,920
She's just a girl!

336
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:28,122
As if you'd brought her as your dowry! She's my daughter too.

337
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,549
Cover your grief in happiness, if you must!

338
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,680
Because I won't value anyone's happiness...

339
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,529
Or life... More than my happiness.

340
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,348
Tell her and Shayan to get ready.

341
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:57,930
The Reverend's here to fix a date for the wedding.

342
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,027
Quickly.

343
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,629
Masooma!

344
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:11,779
Yeah?

345
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,748
That'll be enough...

346
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,939
Your days of joy, fun, and games end here...

347
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,588
Roshni's very worried...

348
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,899
I talked to Adam...

349
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:50,309
He swore by God before her...

350
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:55,234
That no one will say anything...

351
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:01,370
So... I beg you...

352
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,129
Please don't say anything to her.

353
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:09,790
We've got to threaten her before she dares to do it again.

354
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,000
Shut up!

355
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
