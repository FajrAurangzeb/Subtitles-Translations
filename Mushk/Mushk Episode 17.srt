1
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,239
God is the greatest...

2
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,101
Munshi Nizam!

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,516
This gift is perhaps the only thing that's longed to see you as much as me.

4
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,602
Get the kids here...

5
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,797
O Lord...

6
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,355
My nephew...

7
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:07,787
Greet him... Take your blessings.

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,201
Reverend...
-Bless you... Take a seat.

9
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,463
Hey! What d'you think you're doing?

10
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:19,566
You'd sit next to the Reverend?

11
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:23,020
Sit on the floor, or stand where you are...

12
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,764
Sorry...

13
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,261
It's okay if he doesn't know...

14
00:01:28,572 --> 00:01:40,722
Whoever we turn to and look at for a moment thinks he's fortunate and safe...

15
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:46,831
Asher Khan has been one of my most devoted followers...

16
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,028
My eyes bless him all the time...

17
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:56,501
I've been very fortunate indeed...

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,546
Bless her...

19
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,820
May you live long...

20
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,825
Please, sit...

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,891
Your daugher's grown up so fast...

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:24,198
Asher Khan's daughter and her happiness is about to become the key to your fortune.

23
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:30,177
I hope that - like everyone else - it matters to you.

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,568
Take care of Asher Khan's daughter.

25
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,568
Orders, sir?

26
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:49,890
I'll have lunch before I leave...
-Please...

27
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,561
Stay here a while... Honour us with your presence.

28
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:59,720
I've got a few things to do... Sorry...

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,063
I got to go...

30
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:08,131
Tomorrow and the day after would be a great time.

31
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,647
Pick either one.

32
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,856
Thank you so much, Reverend.

33
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,921
Go back to your Mum...

34
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,860
Bless you.

35
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,076
May the Lord give you good fortune...

36
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,125
Thanks.

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,029
And?

38
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,970
And he told me he was going to get the Reverend...

39
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,700
For our marriage...

40
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:13,080
I was delighted to hear him talk about getting married...

41
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,720
But there was this constant fear...

42
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,661
That he won't come back...

43
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:27,800
There was this voice in my heart...

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,103
That something's off...

45
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:35,954
Turns out something <i>was</i> off after all...

46
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,870
He never came back...

47
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,075
I'm so worried, Adam... I don't want to go back...

48
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:27,058
Don't worry. I talked to them. No one's gonna say anything. And if they did... You know I'm right here.

49
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,010
I don't want to live...

50
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,200
You're out of your mind? What are you doing?

51
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,258
Don't be silly, Roshni...

52
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:36,000
What's wrong with you?

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,550
I don't want to go home...

54
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,150
Don't ever say that again...

55
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,198
What if you --

56
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,230
Fear God...

57
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,444
And promise me you won't do it again.

58
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,611
Promise me!

59
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,938
What if something happened to you?

60
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,151
They're all waiting for you...

61
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:08,891
I've gone through so much just to bring you back...

62
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:12,111
Please... Don't even think about it...

63
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,520
Here we are. Home...

64
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,318
Shall we?

65
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,738
Look...

66
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,278
Please...

67
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,070
Believe me... Everyone's waiting for you... We've all been so troubled...

68
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,857
I just can't...

69
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,251
I'd used up every last bit of courage to step out...

70
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,110
How can I go back?
-I'm right here with you...

71
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,780
No one's gonna say anything, no one's gonna do anything.

72
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:42,300
It's not about that... What if Mum just asked about her fault...? What she'd not done for me?

73
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,380
What if Dad - too ill to say anything - just gave me a look, asking me about how I'd disgraced him...

74
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,668
I've got nothing to tell them... Nothing to tell anyone...

75
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:57,448
Not even myself... I don't want to go in...

76
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:08,373
I would ask you why you didn't think of any of this when you stepped out... But I know love better.

77
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,030
I don't think the question suits me...

78
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,530
I know love a lot better than you...

79
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,980
Love rewards itself through trials... Even if your beloved does not...

80
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,607
Your love tried you. You faced it. You triumphed.

81
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,390
But love lost before your lover.

82
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,700
They're all so worried, Roshni...

83
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,330
They're all so worried, Roshni... Mehek...

84
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,170
They're all so worried, Roshni... Mehek, Grandpa...

85
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,747
They're all so worried, Roshni... Mehek, Grandpa... Mum...

86
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,577
C'mon.

87
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,799
No...

88
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,057
I don't feel like...

89
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
You gotta come with me...

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,568
Please... No...

91
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
C'mon.

92
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Here.

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,501
It's okay...

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,728
Roshni!

95
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,536
How are you? I hope you're okay...

96
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,921
I'm not...

97
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:42,602
W -- What happened?

98
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:46,991
I'm s -- scared -- so scared...

99
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,541
What are you scared of?

100
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,988
We left fear far behind...

101
00:09:56,598 --> 00:10:00,670
You've looked defeat in the eye...

102
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,338
But never think it got the better of you.

103
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,817
M -- Mum... Where's Mum?

104
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:16,590
Inside. Waiting for you. Come.

105
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,696
What'd I tell her?

106
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:24,528
I've disgraced her before the world.

107
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:27,260
No one got a word!

108
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,857
Aunt picked a row with the groom's family...

109
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:33,961
Kicked them out...

110
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,200
Don't worry...

111
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,700
If the wound's not too deep...

112
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,900
It's not like I missed!

113
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,078
It struck right where it hurts!

114
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,148
And I'm ready to strike again...

115
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:58,420
Before it dares start healing!

116
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,490
Come in, dear...

117
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,390
They'll be delighted to see you...

118
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,930
No one's gonna say anything...

119
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,989
Come.

120
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:09,090
Curse me...

121
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:18,400
His sweet talk blinded me to my family's honour...

122
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,010
No...

123
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:23,388
Roshni...

124
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,770
God's making you think this way...

125
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,904
Because He doesn't want you to forget it...

126
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,658
No one's gonna say a word...

127
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,568
No one.

128
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,380
Oooh...

129
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,270
Someone give this crybaby an Oscar!

130
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,480
Looking at her innocent tears...

131
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,750
No one would believe how eager she was to run away!

132
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,101
Come.

133
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:00,850
C'mon in...
-Come...

134
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,538
If looks could kill!

135
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,035
So... Enchanting...

136
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,530
My blood was boiling...

137
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,140
Like, literally!

138
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,820
Felt like cursing... Insulting...

139
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,572
But one nonchalant look had that warmth...

140
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,861
I wonder how it'd feel if you looked like you cared...

141
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,946
But I'm only making an exception for you...

142
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:25,130
Aunt's gonna burn in the flames of Hell... By my hand... I gotta make sure of it...

143
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,920
I swear...

144
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,820
I'll char her black as this night...

145
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,457
Calm down, Zulaikha...

146
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:41,008
She's on her way...

147
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,407
No idea how she's been... How she'll be...

148
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:51,248
Let's pray she's fine... Everything's gonna be alright...

149
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,958
Mum...

150
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,339
My dear...

151
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,941
My only hope...

152
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:20,110
I've cried so much waiting for you... Come here...

153
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,658
Mum...

154
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,118
I --

155
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,042
Don't worry...

156
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,298
I won't say anything...

157
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:47,768
I won't ask anything...

158
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,177
Not even how you could forget our honour so easily...

159
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:10,849
Or how you could forget everything I've taught you and leave its bloody corpse just out the back door...

160
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,870
Don't worry...

161
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,060
I won't say a word...

162
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,878
I've promised Mehek...

163
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm sorry, Mum... So sorry...

164
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,791
No...

165
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:33,602
I'm sorry...

166
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,060
I've failed as a mother...

167
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,167
No, Mum...

168
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,059
My upbringing...

169
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,930
You're back...

170
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,828
Thank you...

171
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:03,169
Thank you so much...

172
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,788
Mum...

173
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,828
What are you doing?

174
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,213
You're such a good son...

175
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,609
So upright...

176
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:49,388
No words can ever thank you enough for what you've done...

177
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,697
I'll thank you the way you want me to...
-It's nothing.

178
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,570
The Lord God alone decides...

179
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,370
Who to honour and who to disgrace...

180
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:16,200
He wanted to save your honour, and I just happened to be His agent... That's all I am - His agent...

181
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,279
He could just as well have sent someone else.

182
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,370
But I beg you...

183
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,860
Honour lost once...

184
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,448
Isn't always won back...

185
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:48,140
Please... Honour it and don't say anything to Roshni...

186
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,281
I promise you...

187
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:56,101
Order me... You've done me a great favour...
-It's nothing, really --

188
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,732
Come here... Here...

189
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,990
Rest your head on my lap...

190
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:12,026
Let me stroke you... Caress you... I'm sure all your sorrows will turn to dust...

191
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,260
Come here...
-Mum...

192
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,748
I'm sorry...

193
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,318
You don't know what you've saved...

194
00:18:20,318 --> 00:18:23,309
I can't do anything today...

195
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:27,840
But I'll be where I can one day...

196
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,308
And...

197
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,708
I'll make sure you get everything you ever need.

198
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:38,408
No matter what it takes... You won't even have to ask for it...

199
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,149
Thank you so much...

200
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,539
Adam...

201
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,970
For Christ's sake, please don't insult my sincerity with this...

202
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,630
Sometimes, I wonder...

203
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,240
What I've done to earn your help whenever I need it...

204
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,300
Sometimes, I wonder...

205
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,240
What it is I couldn't do...

206
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,018
What?

207
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:35,608
Nothing, really...

208
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,259
Mehek...

209
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,070
You're happy, aren't you?

210
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,738
Happy?

211
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,786
What is happiness?

212
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,000
What does it mean to be happy?

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,950
I've forgotten everything...

214
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,560
But yeah...

215
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,257
I will say...

216
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm relieved...

217
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,558
And that means so much more...

218
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,868
Thank you so much...

219
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,670
May God grant you everything you wish for...

220
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,669
Mehek...

221
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:22,966
Grandpa wants to see you...

222
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,640
Go. I'm coming...

223
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,018
Okay.

224
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,537
See you...

225
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,138
See you...

226
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,580
May you always be happy, Adam...

227
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,775
Mehek...

228
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,278
We...

229
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,099
We're going to see Shayan tomorrow...

230
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,418
Tomorrow?

231
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,078
Yeah.

232
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
But...

233
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,040
What do I tell them?

234
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,787
No idea...

235
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:12,854
All I know is I'm taking you where you belong.

236
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,988
Okay.
-Be ready.

237
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,990
♪ <i>Love faded as tears took over</i> ♪

238
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,330
♪ <i>Yea, took over...</i> ♪

239
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,220
♪ <i>The redolence faded as sobs of love took over</i> ♪

240
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,414
♪ <i>Yea, took over...</i> ♪

241
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,660
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful...

242
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,498
C'mon...

243
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,998
Easy...

244
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,930
By Grist, ain't we up to something!

245
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,920
Let's try again, shall we?

246
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,460
Again?

247
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,912
Okay...

248
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,053
If you say so...

249
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,257
Whoa!

250
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,525
Wonderful!

251
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,569
Gotta say that's splendid!

252
00:23:14,569 --> 00:23:19,030
Plan B's all set to go just when Plan A started failing!

253
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,890
Okay, that's enough... Tomorrow?

254
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,321
Tomorrow.

255
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,928
Mum...

256
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:46,238
I'm sorry, Mum... I made a big mistake...

257
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,588
I'm so sorry...

258
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,587
Mum...

259
00:24:14,949 --> 00:24:18,269
You're not angry with me, are you?

260
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,891
Swear by me?

261
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,133
Can't believe you're saying that, Adam!

262
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:39,794
You haven't blinked an eye, waiting for her to see your love...

263
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:43,345
Are you seriously going to hand her over to someone else?

264
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,940
He's not just anyone else...

265
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,580
He's her husband...

266
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,910
Her little son deserves to see him...

267
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,138
Deserves to be with him...

268
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:01,778
Are you off your head?

269
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,668
Yeah, I'm off my head...

270
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:14,920
If taking her to her husband... And taking her son to his father means I've lost it, then I'm glad I have.

271
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,980
I don't care about anything else...

272
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,260
Not one bit...

273
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,088
I don't care about anything else...

274
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,592
For the love of God...

275
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:38,288
Anyone got food...

276
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,887
Water for me?

277
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:43,270
Hey! Where are you going?

278
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,877
For God's sake...

279
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,989
How'd you come in?

280
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:54,106
The door was open... I thought someone could...

281
00:25:54,106 --> 00:25:57,066
Please, leave... I'm sorry...

282
00:25:58,126 --> 00:25:59,616
Wait.

283
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,630
In the Lord's name...

284
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,880
In the Lord's name...
-Go...

285
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,370
In the Lord's name...

286
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,680
Here.

287
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,108
So much?

288
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,500
Pray for me, will you?

289
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,959
I --

290
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,895
I'm having a tough time...

291
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,442
I knew when I saw it...

292
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:48,112
I don't get it.

293
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:52,266
No one gives anyone so much unless he's having a tough time.

294
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:56,256
Those who are happy barely give a few quids...

295
00:26:56,256 --> 00:27:00,425
Those who are grieving or fear ill fortune...

296
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:03,869
Give far more...

297
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,818
I've just one thing to say.
-Yeah?

298
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:09,490
Bow and beg before Him.

299
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,420
Beg before Him and He won't disappoint.

300
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,134
I've got so many more to pray for.

301
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,050
May you find happiness.

302
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,808
O Lord...

303
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:17,040
You help whoever begs before You with humility, tears, and sincerity...

304
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,949
You know the pain and the anguish in his heart...

305
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,130
You could give me Mehek...

306
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,478
Couldn't You?

307
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:45,340
But my love won't let me conquer her... My love isn't so weak as to be blind to hers...

308
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,680
So I only want the courage, my Lord...

309
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,822
I just want courage...

310
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:02,110
And I pray that You...

311
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,490
Give Mehek her happiness...

312
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:15,450
I promise You, my Lord...

313
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:23,461
If You gave Mehek her happiness, I'll try my best to find mine in hers...

314
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,796
Please give Mehek the peace and happiness she deserves, my Lord...

315
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,098
Amen.

316
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,888
Wait.

317
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,658
Yeah, Guddi?

318
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,457
G -- Guddi!

319
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,820
It was for Roshni!

320
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,238
Aye. Was for her. Ain't no more.

321
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,839
I thought it's mine.

322
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:12,063
Anyway, go tell Adam to see me in the backyard. Right now.

323
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:13,797
Why?

324
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:17,637
Who are you to ask me anyway? Me Tad?
-'Course not...

325
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:21,870
But -- What do I tell him if he asked why?

326
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,140
Tell him the world's about to end.

327
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,350
God forbid...
-Oh, please... Can it...

328
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,450
It ain't the end of your tiny world. Okay?

329
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,649
Go! Double time! That way.

330
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,280
Adam...

331
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,608
Mehek told you I've been crying for ages, didn't she?

332
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:51,679
You weren't taking my call!

333
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,769
Why didn't you come home?

334
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,518
Well, Guria -- I --

335
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:59,328
Come.

336
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,933
I --

337
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,730
I'm fine...

338
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,800
Just -- Come...
-Some friends are coming over... I need to see them... It's important... I'll be back once I'm done.

339
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,691
Some friends are coming over... I need to see them... It's important... I'll be back once I'm done.

340
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,898
Promise.

341
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,618
Get back quickly.

342
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,198
I'm fine...

343
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,087
Masooma...

344
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:32,607
Uncle got this gown for you... From the city! What d'you say?

345
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:35,764
Lovely!
-Innit?

346
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:40,270
The veil's lovely too.
-I'm wearing red too!

347
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,058
Twinning with you!

348
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:46,368
Like it?
-Love it!

349
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,950
Where is he?

350
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,218
No idea. I'm sure Adam knows though.

351
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:37,979
I didn't ask you! Just talkin' to myself.

352
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,139
I heard it though...

353
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:44,020
Oh, you did? You better lock that tongue inside your mouth and shut your gob!

354
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,538
Get going!

355
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,130
What is it?

356
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,233
Munna said --

357
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:59,610
The world's about to end...
-God forbid -- but that's what he said.

358
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,281
Is it true? What Mehek said...

359
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,591
That you've found him? You-know-who?

360
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,878
Yeah.

361
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:14,668
You ain't lying, are you?

362
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,002
I don't lie.

363
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,480
Well, unfortunately...

364
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,120
That's the problem with your type.

365
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,140
You don't normally lie...

366
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,590
But you think it's a virtue...

367
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,137
To lie for someone's happiness.

368
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,620
Don't do anything for her happiness... It isn't meant for you.

369
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,128
It's always about profit and loss for you, innit? Everything, every feeling...

370
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,870
Not really...

371
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,370
But avoiding losses can be a great profit too!

372
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,976
I've lived a life of avoiding losses, Adam... So I know it well...

373
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,578
Someone's coming...

374
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,248
It's you!

375
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,036
Aye, had to ask Munna to -- I'll get going --
-If you're done...

376
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,619
Yeah?

377
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:33,468
I want to ask something too...

378
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:34,998
Go on.

379
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,821
Why can't all men be like you?

380
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,257
Why d'you want to curse everyone?

381
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,378
It pains to be me...

382
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,315
Every feeling weighs a ton...

383
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,947
On my heart...

384
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,787
Every beat hurts... But you gotta go on...

385
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,540
For all that you've done for me...

386
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,088
I'll pray for you...

387
00:35:22,277 --> 00:35:28,597
Whoever sees you will know you've earned someone's blessings.

388
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,948
Thank you.

389
00:35:32,928 --> 00:35:35,758
It's getting late. Go.

390
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,510
'Earned someone's blessings'...

391
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,088
Psst!

392
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,698
Come here.

393
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,307
Ie, here.

394
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,571
What are you afraid of?

395
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:58,300
God forbid -- I hope I haven't scared you!

396
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,320
C'mon, don't let me debase myself so much!

397
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,891
So many times, I've asked the mirror... So many times, I've heard just praises...

398
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,352
I never even thought that...

399
00:36:12,287 --> 00:36:14,354
So... What d'you want?

400
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:15,997
Look...

401
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:23,920
Newly-broken hearts - like Roshni's - long for a shoulder to cry on.

402
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,410
And there's no shortage of shoulders looking to give refuge to broken hearts.

403
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,220
So... Be careful, okay?

404
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,539
Thanks for droppin' by!

405
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,647
Goodbye!

406
00:36:40,647 --> 00:36:44,000
Ie... If ever there's anyone...!

407
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
