1
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,177
Open this door!

2
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,407
Anyone!

3
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,299
For the love of God... Please...

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,968
Anyone there...

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,638
Please... Open this door...

6
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm dying in here...

7
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,038
OPEN THE DOOR!

8
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,939
Please...

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,810
Sure, Mr Gardezi... She'll be there by 8.

10
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,409
Okay.

11
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,994
Go and ask Sheena to get ready.

12
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:34,940
Please... Open this door...

13
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,611
Please...

14
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,698
Please, Madame... Open the door... She's been crying her guts out.

15
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:54,928
Not as much as you did when your brother-in-law sold you. Did I open the door for you?

16
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:56,538
No.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,078
Let her starve for a day.

18
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:05,618
Hunger will make her see some sense.

19
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,819
Ma'am.

20
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,658
Yes?

21
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,250
Water.

22
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:33,428
Water... Everywhere... This sinking feeling...

23
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,929
I meant... Do you want water?

24
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,320
No...

25
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:48,967
You really should. You've been crying buckets, drying your heart out, giving it a hard time.

26
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,838
No.

27
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,667
I know how you feel...

28
00:03:54,946 --> 00:04:03,867
You're brave... Back at the pentref, Bano eloped with Miskin, the barber... It wasn't even an hour before her Mam and Tad...

29
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,747
Let's just say they chose death over disgrace.

30
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:11,857
Thank the Lord you still stand strong.

31
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,127
Sorry if it's something I said...

32
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:24,467
Please, drink some, okay? I'll leave it here.

33
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,699
You're sitting here!

34
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,777
Yeah? Your oul' fella's place, is it?
-No...

35
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,769
I couldn't care less if it were, okay?

36
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:54,348
They're here.

37
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:56,689
Everyone?
-Yeah.

38
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,378
And Grandpa?
-Of course.

39
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,519
Just barely didn't make it...
-What?

40
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,060
Nothing... I hope Grandpa's right as rain now!

41
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,488
Yeah.
-Okay.

42
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,079
Now get out of my sights!

43
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:22,027
Tears, grief, heart attacks, honour... You bilkers disappoint me! Couldn't even claim one of 'em!

44
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,728
Thank goodness you're here...

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,378
Alright... Stop here...

46
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,503
You sure you can walk?

47
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,078
I'll try.
-Come.

48
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,380
Hello?
-Where are you?

49
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,908
How are you? How's Grandpa?

50
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:16,049
I'm as fine as Grandpa.

51
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,323
He's better.

52
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,388
So am I.

53
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:21,898
He's back.

54
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank the Lord...

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
Got word yet?

56
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,537
Aye... But just a word...

57
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:35,067
But don't worry, I'll be in Karachi by the morning. Find out everything I can.

58
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,767
Tell me you'll find her...

59
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:41,707
If we could find Shayan, I'm sure we can find her too...

60
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:43,898
I promise you, Mehek...

61
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:47,567
I'll do everything I can to bring her back.

62
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:51,597
And... As soon as we're back...

63
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:55,157
I'll drop you at Shayan's.

64
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,941
Take care. I'll get back soon...

65
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,828
Yeah? Everything alright?

66
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:20,358
Why are you doing all of this? <i>Any</i> of this?

67
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,831
Why? Well...

68
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm doing this because... Mehek...

69
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,028
Because I...

70
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:34,178
I...

71
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:37,708
I really...

72
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,148
Yeah?

73
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:48,413
I really care for you... I know how you feel... We've grown up together...

74
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:54,178
<i>You</i>'ve grown up... I'm still stuck somewhere back there I guess...

75
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:56,210
I don't get it.

76
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,811
Who'd know it better than me that you don't get it?

77
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,900
Let's just say the Lord's enlisted me for this.

78
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,881
Don't worry. I'll bring Roshni back.

79
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,270
I'll get back. Bye. And please... Don't worry.

80
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,920
Bye...

81
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,675
Don't even think of going out... Wait here.

82
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:15,470
An unpleasant death awaits you outside.

83
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,670
But I care for you... You could say I'm a friend...

84
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,199
I want to save your life.

85
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,699
Tell me...

86
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,070
They've done something to my Saqib, haven't they?

87
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:40,322
They haven't -- God forbid -- Killed him, have they?

88
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:51,030
<i>Your</i> Saqib? He was never yours, girl! He sold his 'love' and your honour to Madame Ruby for two million.

89
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:58,840
They're very dangerous. Resist and they'll kill you.

90
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,948
If you don't believe me... Look at this...

91
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:11,530
And now, we turn to a gruesome incident from Karachi. Two young girls were found dead at Clifton Beach this morning.

92
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:17,983
Sources identify them as Suraiyya and Ruqaiyya. They'd come to Karachi from a hamlet in the Punjab in search of a job

93
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,511
Madame Ruby bought them too.

94
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,791
Very upright, both of them.

95
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:29,211
It's just a matter of a few months... Just do as Madame Ruby says...

96
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:34,435
Win her trust, and when you get the chance... Run away!

97
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,050
Why are you so restless, Mr Gardezi?

98
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,588
I've sent her... She'll be there any moment.

99
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,488
On her way right now, of course!

100
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:16,788
But you disappoint me... Just one thing I asked for... And you...

101
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:22,292
You've told them? Great. Thank you!

102
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,028
Bye.

103
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,878
Done.

104
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:35,758
I've scared her so proper I could see it in her eyes!

105
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,998
You can put her pictures up now.

106
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,638
What's up with the telly?

107
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,368
Call the cable guy. It's time for my favourite drama.

108
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,269
Just a sec...

109
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,252
Guddi!

110
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,959
Take my hand.

111
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,238
C'mon!

112
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,088
Now let go.

113
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,758
Boundaries.

114
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,018
Shamim!

115
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:25,294
Get me some cold water!

116
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,758
Have something.

117
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:38,530
And what are you doing?

118
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,007
Please, have something.

119
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,689
I don't feel like it.

120
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,016
I beg you...

121
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:56,560
Stop my tears...

122
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
Save my life...

123
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,311

Why are you helping me?
-No.

134
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:17,180
Guddi doesn't help anyone. She always helps herself when she wants to, and she wants when...

135
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,110
How say we leave that for another day?

136

Our knight marches forth. Surely, he won't disappoint!

139
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,540
By the way, don't let anyone know you're better now, okay?
-Sure.

140
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,030
See you in the morning. Nighty night!

Gotta say, you make such a lovely Mam...

144
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:11,040
Because you're such a lovely granddaughter already, you ought to rush down to be the lovely niece!

145
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,381
Your Aunt's grieving because her daughter turned out to be... You know...

146
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,020
I mean... Because her daughter's run away... So she's down there, alive, but not quite...

147
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,113
She won't eat. Won't drink water.

148
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:32,131
She'd rather weep at her lost honour and drown in her tears.

149
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:37,211
Guess why she isn't going into her room? She's worried what she'll tell her husband. Like, seriously?

150

Look after Shahmir. I'll be back...

Don't get on my wick. I want my money.
-But how...?

Here...

163
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:36,368
Sell these tomorrow... Keep everything you get...

164
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:40,065
How dare you?

165
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:43,145
I'm asking for my pay.

166
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:49,515
I'm not your servant or a blimmin' blackmailer! I need my money, and I need it tomorrow.

167
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,348
You'll get it.

168
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,148
Roshni!

169
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,568
Get up, Roshni!

170
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,388
'Morning, Mum...
-Morning. Go have breakfast.

171
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,768
Get up, Roshni!

172
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,258
Not now, Mum... Gimme two minutes...

173
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:25,548
What good is it? Your sister's gone downstairs too... Get up and have breakfast; you're getting late!

174
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:28,277
Get up, Roshni!

175
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,719
Saqib...

176
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,107
Saqib!

177
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,598
Shayan!

178
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,888
Get up!

179
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,019
Good Lord... Wake up, mate!

180
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,240
Shayan!
-Mhm...

181
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,438
Get up! I'm getting late...

182
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,958
Shayan?
-Hmm?

183
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:08,798
I've been screaming for ages! Get up already!
-Mhm...

184
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:14,267
Okay... You asked for it!

185
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:18,691
Get up! Now!

186
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,450
Okay! Hey! Stop!
-Shayan!

187
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:27,088
I have to go to University! Got an assignment to submit!
-Be done with the water already!

188
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:30,175
Get up!
-Okay...

189
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,241
Shayan...

190
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,917
Shayan...

191
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:14,688
I've got a maths exam...

192
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:19,180
Could you help me with this question?

193
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,470
What's up, Mr Romeo?

194
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,160
You say no day is complete until you've seen me...

195
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,898
I was looking out the window all the way today...

196
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,740
I didn't see you.

197
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,708
Roshni...

198
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:16,169
I've given you an anaesthetic... Let me know if it hurts.
-Sure...

199
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,559
Who is it?
-'Sec...

200
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,618
Yeah?

201
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,857
Where's Dr Rana?

202
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:32,630
He's busy right now...
-Tell him it's Guddi.

203
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,917
I told you he's busy.
-I told you to tell him it's me!

204
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,688
Okay... Doc...

205
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:45,289
It's a certain Guddi... Wants to talk to you...
-Yeah, give it here...

206
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,738
Yeah, just a sec... Here.

207
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:50,208
Hello?

208
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,100
I need to see you. Right now.
-Right now?

209
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,241
I'll be there in an hour.

210
00:20:56,241 --> 00:21:04,901
It's 15 minutes to the mansion. Get here before the 16th, or I ain't callin' you or lookin' your way again.

211
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:10,131
I'm stitching up this patient, Guddi... I just need...

212
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:11,532
Hello?

213
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,191
Guddi? Hello?

214
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,117
Here...
-Sir...

215
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,650
What are you doing?
-Nothing you can't finish, I'm sure?

216
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,208
Doctor!

217
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,356
Doc!

218
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,390
Doctor's orders, I guess?

219
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,750
Hey...

220
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,310
Do it only if you know how... Don't try something... You know...

221
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,637
Don't worry, sir... It'll hurt a bit, but only for a moment...

222
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,218
Ow!

223
00:21:57,218 --> 00:21:58,578
What?

224
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:00,419
Madame Ruby?

225
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,518
You know her?

226
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,360
Mr Nusrat said you're such an upright man...

227
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,593
Why?

228
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:14,547
What makes you... Doubt it?

229
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:21,134
You want to journey into the abyss... Yet you're so afraid of the scars...

230
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,869
What does she do?
-Ehh?

231
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:32,649
Don't you know her? Who are you kidding? Why are you here if you don't know her?

232
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:42,557
Please don't ask anything... Just think someone's life is at stake and tell me what you know...

233
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:50,150
Few are famous for being upright... Very few...

234
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,508
Let's just say Ruby's the other sort.

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,669
I need to pay her a visit.

236
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,180
Why are you here?
-Please don't ask any questions... Just tell me what you know.

237
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:10,471
I swear to God you'll be rewarded for it. Someone's in trouble.

238
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:23,748
One of my friends... A businessman... He's quite close to this Ruby...

239
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:29,038
I'll talk to him... Fix an appointment for you...
-Please.

240
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:34,669
When?
-Right now. Call him right now. Tell him it's now or never.

241
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:37,458
Okay... I'll see what I can do...

242
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,220
Just three seconds away from being too late!

243
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,260
I could've done anything to stop those three seconds from passing! Clipped their wings if I had to!

244
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,548
Gonna ask me why I've called you?

245
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,096
Lemme take a good look... Before I... Start asking...

246
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:07,388
You can ask while you look, and look while you ask...
-Aye... Normally, yeah...

247
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:10,589
But you're so special...

248
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:13,670
Anyway... Here goes...

249
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,660
Why'd you call me here?

250
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,778
I've never had a dream in my sleep... Not for a moment... But only when awake...

251
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:27,359
Before last night. Guess who I saw in my dream?

252
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:32,430
I pray you say my name! I'll give everyone sweets!

253
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,018
Well, then...

254
00:24:34,018 --> 00:24:36,508
What are you waiting for?

255
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,138
Your wish is my command.

256
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:53,078
Your guest... Is ours...

257
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:58,108
Don't worry... We'll give him a warm welcome.

258
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,417
Did she have anything?

259
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:13,587
Of course. She's so scared to see the murder videos she's doing everything I say! I've got her wrapped around my little finger!

260
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:16,518
Get Roshni ready...

261
00:25:16,518 --> 00:25:19,938
Make sure she looks extra lovely.

262
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:22,688
But don't go overboard with the makeup.

263
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,950
Too much makeup would be so... Insulting to her youthful charms...

264
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,060
Blimey... Every word you say is so poetic...

265
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:39,108
Oh, please... Put a sock in it... Go.

266
00:25:43,305 --> 00:25:48,486
Just a minute... I'll check with the doctor and...
-Is he here yet?

267
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, he's inside... Please, wait here.

268
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,497
Doc...

269
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:02,770
Hmm?

270
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,500
The patients have been waiting for an hour!

271
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:10,240
Let them...

272
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:13,720
I haven't got the time...

273
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,100
Too busy thinking of someone...

274
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:22,642
Okay, Doc... Doctor's orders, I guess?

275
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,482
Guddi...

276
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,581
Guddi...

277
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,437
Guddi...

278
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,587
Oh, how these tearful eyes must've driven your lover mad...

279
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:29,328
Gotta say, you're one lovely maid...

280
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,948
Munna... Here...

281
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,339
I'm sure you're tired...

282
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:53,220
No... I just love his little eyes, cute little hands and feet... I want to be with him all day... Play with him all the time...

283
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,859
Okay...

284
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,318
Go. I need to talk to Mehek.

285
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:03,205
Lemme play for a moment?
-What?

286
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:09,526
D'you think he's a blimmin' bat or ball? Ask him to leave, Mehek... We need to talk.

287
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:13,871
Give him to me and go...

288
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,868
Easy there...

289
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,951
Your money's in your drawer.

290
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:35,850
My love, you take my questions away! Neat! Thank you!

291
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,857
M'boy...

292
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,699
Looks like he's here...

293
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,248
I'll go see...

294
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:29,408
Who d'you want to see, sir?

295
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:32,659
The name's Adam. I'm here to see Madame Ruby.

296
00:29:35,889 --> 00:29:38,350
We need to search you, sir.

297
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,321
Adam, is that you?

298
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,658
Yes.

299
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,778
Khan...

300
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:54,766
We don't search our guests.

301
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:55,889
Ma'am...

302
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:57,730
Let him in.

303
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,677
Come. Here.

304
00:29:59,677 --> 00:30:01,495
Thanks.

305
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,040
I've had enough of tittle-tattle...
-Bienvenue!

306
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:21,780
You hear me? If I don't get the money tomorrow, I'll crumble his false sense of honour like a tissue paper and throw it in the bin!

307
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:28,040
Don't you dare threaten me with the cops. Rosy doesn't fear them.

308
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,200
You know your place... Don't try to trick me!

309
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,927
Aye... I want the money tomorrow.

310
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,998
Mind if I ask something?

311
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:45,095
No.

312
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,505
You had a lover like Adam...

313
00:30:47,505 --> 00:30:53,269
Who lives in wait of the day he'd get to die for you... But you had to marry that rat Shayan!

314
00:30:53,269 --> 00:31:00,580
Keep your voice down! I'll be doomed if someone heard that!
-You're doomed, except you don't see it.

315
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:06,800
When a husband deserts his wife and baby, she's doomed, so to speak.

316
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:18,549
Come in. Make yourself at home. Please...

317
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,669
Take a seat.

318
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,483
My apologies...

319
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,948
I've apologised... Won't you say thank you?

320
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,348
Well, thanks...

321
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:53,590
Wow, you're so simple... You didn't even ask why I asked for a thanks.

322
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,898
I know why...

323
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:01,249
You stopped the guards before they could search me...

324
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,109
Oh...

325
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:09,458
Looks like you're smart after all...

326
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:14,978
Mr Waqas Hassan is rather self-concerned...

327
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:22,548
He isn't usually so concerned about someone else...

328
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:31,060
Before you came in, he told me I'll be having an important guest... Asked me to take care of you...

329
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,888
Naturally, I agreed...

330
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:38,208
Gave him my word, so to speak.

331
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,730
And you got to stand by your word.

332
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,580
Willy

333
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,444
Willy-nilly.

334
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,427
Not cricket. You didn't tell me...

335
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:00,678
You don't get admirers like Adam just like that.

336
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,410
How'd you miss him?

337
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,069
It's nothing...

338
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:08,652
We grew up together... I guess that's why...

339
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,508
Adam's a good man...

340
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,260
Naw, if he were <i>just</i> that, he'd be in the BASW or something...

341
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,770
But he only helps you.

342
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,737
Because he's much more...

343
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:29,767
He's a devoted lover...

344
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,826
Please...

345
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,960
Keep swiping...

346
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,348
Just stop at the one you like...

347
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,090
How'd you like some sandalwood syrup?

348
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,258
God, I love it so much...

349
00:33:59,258 --> 00:34:02,650
The aroma, the flavour...

350
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,983
What a lovely feeling... Orgasmic...

351
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,018
Whoa...

352
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,799
Gotta say, you're quite the connoisseur!

353
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,848
Get her here...

354
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,348
Please, have a sip...

355
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,378
I don't think it's working!
-Shut up...

356
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,408
I mean it...

357
00:35:38,408 --> 00:35:41,674
Some tea for you... Please, have some.

358
00:35:41,998 --> 00:35:44,828
Don't want it. Get out.

359
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,209
As you say...

360
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,647
(Like I care!)

361
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,498
I've been dying for this moment!

362
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,300
I've been living for this moment!

363
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,120
Come in.

364
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,350
Don't be shy...

365
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,177
Greet him.

366
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,277
Good day, sir...

367
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
