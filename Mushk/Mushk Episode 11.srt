1
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,980
A child... A daughter is the dearest of all...

2
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:41,125
A hundred pearls cannot come close to a single tear falling from your child's eyes.

3
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:49,683
She's in tears before you two got married!

4
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,040
So...

5
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,461
What is it?

6
00:01:55,773 --> 00:02:06,046
I braved every sorrow, hoping that my daughter would be repaid in happiness for everything I suffered.

7
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,014
You extinguished that hope.

8
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,734
Let me take a look...

9
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,450
I don't like this eye makeup... Please start it over again...

10
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:48,062
For the love of God... We've done it over three times! We've got other weddings to go to, you know.

11
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:51,085
Please do it over. I don't like it one bit.

12
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:54,497
Hey! Why aren't you ready yet?

13
00:02:54,497 --> 00:03:01,240
Just -- Just fifteen more minutes, Mum... They haven't done my eyes very well... They'll start over.

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,920
I wish your ads could give a better idea about your work!

15
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,820
Hey!

16
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,204
Shut up and 'Hey' your Mum like that! Quickly, now, get to it!

17
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,440
There's something I wanted to tell you...
-Yeah?

18
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,845
They're here for Roshni... Adam's here too.

19
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,842
Is that it?

20
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:25,973
I've welcomed them myself.

21
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,887
I know...

22
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,895
What is it then?

23
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:32,742
Mehek's in there, crying.

24
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:34,506
Why?

25
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,028
She's getting married to the man of her dreams... What's her problem?

26
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:48,610
She says her Mam would've held her hand and taken her downstairs if she were with us.

27
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,788
Why aren't you talking to me?

28
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,414
Mum?

29
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,457
Yeah?

30
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:14,890
I'm gonna need twenty minutes or so... Why don't you go take Mehek downstairs?

31
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,869
It'll delight her... And Grandpa.

32
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,733
What's the big deal? I'll take you both downstairs together.

33
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,350
It wouldn't really be the same...

34
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,215
But... As you wish...

35
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,647
Okay.

36
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:41,460
I'll escort her downstairs. Get ready quick.

37
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,668
Yeah.
-Get to it!

38
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,450
Come, Guddi...

39
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,963
Yeah, the eyes...

40
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,974
Actually, forget it. I can do the rest myself. Go. I don't think you can do it.

41
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,600
Go!

42
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,092
Aren't you getting late for somewhere or something?

43
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,912
Blimey...

44
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,381
Let her have it her way...

45
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:24,430
My heart wants to tell you everything I've gone through...

46
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:32,250
But my mind makes every betrayal come to life before me, and shoots my heart dead with it!

47
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,513
Why did you agree, then?

48
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:43,021
Uncle's might... My helplessness... Neither would budge one bit.

49
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:49,550
So you want me to give his might and your helplessness free rein to kill my daughter's happiness?

50
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,303
I don't fear his threats.

51
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,993
My sister loves her kids so much...

52
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:08,634
He said her husband would divorce her and take the kids with him if I didn't give in.

53
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:14,015
If only you had an ounce of that love for <i>my</i> daughter!

54
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,300
What do you say? What should I do?

55
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,160
Wait here.

56
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,966
I'll be back.

57
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,104
Why aren't you answering my phone?

58
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,040
I'll go get my bag...

59
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,351
♪ <i>My heart was set on a dream</i> ♪

60
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:03,788
♪ <i>That's falling apart at the seam</i> ♪

61
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,440
Roshni! You ready?

62
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,926
Yeah.

63
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,195
Hello?

64
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,356
Ie.

65
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:26,390
I'll be at the gate with Roshni in about eight minutes. Where are you?

66
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,821
Close by. In the back alley.

67
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:51,780
I'll go have a look. Check if anyone's around. I'll watch out for you. Just be ready to move on my signal. And hide this bag behind you, okay?
-Okay.

68
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,747
Here.

69
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,840
Leave this place.

70
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,865
They'll catch me again.

71
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:09,720
You say you're fearless, but hesitate so much.

72
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,700
No time to waver. You'll lose everything if you don't do anything. So... Which way is it?

73
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:23,032
And what if I got there but didn't get what I'm doing all of this for?

74
00:09:23,032 --> 00:09:27,363
Stand firm against Asher Khan's tyranny.

75
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,980
I'll clear the way for you downstairs.

76
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,363
Get out by the back gate.

77
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,050
I should take a look...

78
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,357
What if it's someone else?

79
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,545
Dad?

80
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,270
Love, care, affection...

81
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,566
I couldn't give you anything, my dear...

82
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,404
But now that I see you leaving... It feels like you're taking my world with you...

83
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,548
There'd be nothing left of it the moment your steps took you out of this place... It'll all be so... Empty...

84
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:11,468
Why are you saying that, Dad?

85
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,834
Please... Forgive me for everything...

86
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,713
God bless you, love.

87
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,821
He better not throw a spanner in the works!

88
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,978
Munna...

89
00:11:45,978 --> 00:11:51,170
Take him downstairs. The guests are here. It isn't proper... C'mon, now...

90
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,260
Gettin' all dewy-eyed, are we?

91
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,749
Wait here. I'll be back.

92
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,433
Fine now?

93
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:27,940
Shahmir's seriously ill...

94
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,155
On your feet, Roshni! Double time! Shut the door!

95
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,087
Close it already!

96
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,721
Quickly!

97
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,989
All clear! Come!

98
00:13:16,989 --> 00:13:20,630
Hey! Where are you off to? Back gate, remember?

99
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,154
Come.

100
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,822
Guard!

101
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,252
He's gone. Come.

102
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,155
You're clear.

103
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,903
What happened?

104
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm not doing something wrong... Am I?

105
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,380
Of course you are. Very wrong, in fact. Stopping for the most ill-timed questions!

106
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,021
Get going, mun! Double time!

107
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,880
Guard!

108
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,771
Get me these medicines.

109
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,378
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:22,659
Quickly! Get back quick, okay?

111
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,398
Go!

112
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,994
Psst!

113
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,135
I've sent the guards away. Your way's clear for half an hour.

114
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:52,328
Whatever happens, just... Don't be afraid. Take up arms against tyranny and you'll find that fate stands with you like a mother.

115
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:54,108
Quickly, now!

116
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,553
Thank you, Aunt... Thank you so much...

117
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,015
I may be on the side of the unfaithful... But I'm not one of them!

118
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,189
Come in.

119
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,270
I hope you like the room.
-Of course, thanks.

120
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,446
Just call 313 if you need anything.

121
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,556
Go and change. I'll get something for us.

122
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,001
Roshni!

123
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,925
Roshni! Where are you?

124
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:57,106
Everyone's ready!

125
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,088
Roshni?

126
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,818
Now where'd she go?

127
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,988
What's for dinner?

128
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:17,647
I'll tell you in a sec. Thank you.

129
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,997
Where's your wedding gown?

130
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:32,078
Threw it away with the same unease, agony, and grief I'd put it on with.

131
00:17:34,577 --> 00:17:37,177
Get me a new one, okay?

132
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:40,357
I give you my life!

133
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,908
We leave in an hour and a half. As you like it.

134
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,239
Want to have something?

135
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:51,797
No.

136
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,378
Where were you?

137
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,785
Putting him to sleep. He's not well, you know...

138
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,863
Let's go get Roshni.

139
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,527
Mum! Mum! Roshni isn't in her room!

140
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,798
What?

141
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,388
Must've gone for a stroll... Go see the guests. I'll get her.

142
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,138
Roshni!

143
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,505
Roshni!

144
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,690
Roshni?

145
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,718
Roshni...

146
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,213
Roshni!

147
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,638
Roshni...?

148
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,548
Roshni!

149
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,479
Roshni...!

150
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,041
Roshni!

151
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,007
Roshni!

152
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,449
Wait.

153
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:32,400
Where?

154
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,874
Aliya said you called us to get Roshni.

155
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,481
I'll call you when she's ready.

156
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,122
Go.

157
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,088
You'll get petrol for 50 Rupees, I tell you!

158
00:19:56,088 --> 00:20:00,020
Aye, the day you become the Prime Minister!

159
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,450
You havin' a Turkish?

160
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,260
No, we're just waiting for the day.
-Celebrating in advance, you know?

161
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,355
Qutb!
-Grandpa?

162
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:07,953
Come here.

163
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,468
It's getting late. The Reverend's waiting. Go and get Roshni.

164
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:26,540
Sure... By the way... They're filling nominations for the local election next week... You made me a promise...

165
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,838
And I will honour it, but go get Roshni first!

166
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,129
Grandpa!

167
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,910
Get going already!

168
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,960
What a twit!

169
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,548
Zulaikha!

170
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,468
Zulaikha...?

171
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,968
Zulaikha...

172
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,978
Good Lord...

173
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:51,150
Your teary eyes, your worried face, your heart growing restless by the moment... That's all it'd take to kill me...

174
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:58,871
Please wipe your tears. Stop worrying, and get a hold on yourself!

175
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:01,020
How?

176
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,058
Just... How?

177
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:11,921
My daughter ran away, desecrating my honour with her filthy footsteps!

178
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,040
It's her wedding... They're all down there...

179
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:30,338
And their questions wait out the door, mocking... Look at them jeer at me, knowing I have no answer...

180
00:23:30,338 --> 00:23:34,468
How do I get a grip on myself?

181
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,610
Zulaikha...

182
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,657
Don't worry, even if things go out of hand...

183
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,280
Would you rather wait for a quiet death...

184
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,010
Or try your best to get out?

185
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,180
So... Which way is it? A quiet death in inaction or giving your best shot to survive?

186
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,875
For the love of God... Help me... Save me from this disgrace...

187
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,937
I will.

188
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:20,487
You have my word.

189
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,410
But there's something you must do...

190
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:33,650
Order me. I can give you my life.

191
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,540
In that case...

192
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,331
Wipe these tears...

193
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,381
I can't see them.

194
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,860
There.

195
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,740
Now, listen to me and do as I say...

196
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,238
Two tickets to Karachi, please.

197
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,916
What happened?

198
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,839
No idea...

199
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:15,850
Why do I see this fear in your eyes?

200
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:24,020
Your eyes should be glowing to see your destination...

201
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:30,183
Don't insult your destination by looking at it with such fear and sorrow...

202
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,760
C'mon.

203
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,348
It's all an illusion...

204
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,899
A trick I'm playing on myself...

205
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,739
But Lord... What a lovely illusion...

206
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:08,149
They say illusions are lovely until you find out it's a trick...

207
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:12,010
I know everything about it...

208
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,099
But this illusion refuses to lose its appeal for me...

209
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,353
Sorry...

210
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,640
You're fine, aren't you?

211
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:44,328
Got word of Shayan?

212
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,290
Not yet...

213
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,590
But I'm working on it... Hope to hear something soon...

214
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,431
And how are you, little one? Lookin' lush, not gonna lie! Congratulations!
-Thank you.

215
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,640
Bless you, bless you all! Especially our two stars here! Would you look at them!

216
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,570
Don't let it go to your head, okay?

217
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,297
I ain't callin' you stars because you're looking as lovely and bright as the stars.

218
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:31,560
You're the stars of this show, right? Puttin' up your best act? And, dyw, this groom for hire here's a real gem!

219
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,210
Ward the evil eye off them, will you? I'll be back!

220
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,317
Rana...

221
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:53,699
Do you think it'll be anything close to as easy as it sounds?

222
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,889
My confidence won't let doubt creep in.

223
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:10,118
Someone's gotta be disgraced today...

224
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:17,367
Just... Do as I say and I assure you... It won't be you.

225
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,937
We can wait here, Saqib.

226
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:28,798
Not here.

227
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,218
Over there. Come.

228
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,504
Here.

229
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,770
Want to have something?

230
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,248
Bye.

231
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,940
See you...

232
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,988
Hey!

233
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,330
Why are you out here in the dark?

234
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,585
We're just... You know...

235
00:30:24,585 --> 00:30:29,825
It's getting late. Why don't you wait in there?

236
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:36,250
Except if you're... Hiding something?

237
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,240
H --

238
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,098
H -- How do you know?

239
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:46,690
I have enough experience reading that silence.

240
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:56,468
In your case, I read worry... And a fair bit of fear...

241
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,557
What is it?

242
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:01,680
I can help.

243
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,547
Well...

244
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,548
Zulaikha...

245
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,221
Who told you?

246
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,488
Grandpa...

247
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,260
How does he know?

248
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,778
He planned it!

249
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:35,110
What are you saying?

250
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:41,705
Grandpa says I can stand for the local elections this --

251
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,238
Roshni's eloped!

252
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,467
Roshni...?

253
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,809
Run away...

254
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,900
I couldn't even govern my house...

255
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,493
How'll I run this country?

256
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,930
The end of my political career...

257
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,668
The end of my political career before it even began...?

258
00:32:12,918 --> 00:32:15,029
What'll they think?

259
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:33,030
Take up arms against tyranny and you'll find that fate stands with you like a mother.

260
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,950
Where to?

261
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,030
Where's the detective chief inspector?

262
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,841
He'll be here in three hours.

263
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,201
Three hours?
-Yes.

264
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,031
I'll wait here.

265
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,390
Please call the bride. It's time for the nuptials.
-I'm getting late too.

266
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,350
She'll be here in a moment... I sent for her...

267
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,618
Qutbuddin will be here with her any moment...

268
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:36,298
Girls these days...

269
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,428
Girls these days... You know...

270
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:39,479
Girls these days... You know... Take forever...

271
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:42,780
Girls these days... You know... Take forever... What with friends and all...

272
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:54,290
Take a good look, m'girl. Few kids get to see their Paw as a groom...

273
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,440
Excuse me, siùir!
-God forgive you!

274
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,389
How easily you 'siùir'red your wife!

275
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,430
What are you saying?

276
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,608
Whose kid? Whose wife? And what marriage --?

277
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:17,179
My marriage to you! Our daughter! You lying cheat!

278
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,928
Oh, shut up! Stop accusing my son!

279
00:34:20,928 --> 00:34:25,078
Happy now? Always wanted to ruin my life, didn't ya?

280
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:30,040
Snatched your son back from me so that you could give him to someone else?

281
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,829
What are you saying?

282
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:35,368
Only the truth...

283
00:34:35,729 --> 00:34:44,219
He didn't send a penny home for three months, and my poor little daughter's been starving...

284
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:46,819
And he's here getting married!

285
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,209
He's the most upright man around here!

286
00:34:49,209 --> 00:34:51,209
Another word and...!

287
00:34:51,209 --> 00:34:53,059
What do you think you're doing?

288
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:58,019
I don't know her, and I sure as anything don't know her daughter!

289
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,310
Why should we believe you?

290
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:04,280
I swear by my daughter's life...

291
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,087
He's my husband!

292
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,890
And -- If you didn't believe me... I'll burn myself to death right here!

293
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:26,428
And you! You better come back right away, or the cops will be lookin' for you!

294
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,520
Twenty years running a clinic here...

295
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,108
All I've earned here is respect.

296
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,520
I vouched for you...

297
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:47,349
And you thank me by betraying my trust!

298
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,781
Get out! Right now!

299
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,353
Out!

300
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:56,760
You have no right to do any of this, Doctor.

301
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,570
Just let chaos reign...

302
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,010
Your honour depends on it!

303
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,577
Zulaikha asked me to do this. I swear!

304
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:12,078
Out!

305
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:13,820
Get out!
-But -- Doc!

306
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,780
Just listen to me!
-Why'd she lie?
-I don't know, but she was!
-But we mean it for real! Out!

307
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:25,090
Please -- Listen to us!
-Get going! We don't want to hear anything! We won't take any of that nonsense! Out!

308
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:32,188
Never thought you'd be so shameless! Out of my sights! Out!
-I swear she's lying!

309
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,790
I better not see you coming this way again!

310
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
