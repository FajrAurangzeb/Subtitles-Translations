1
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,530
Don't worry...

2
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,830
I'm not gonna burn your sister...

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,959
Go back to the estate and call me...

4
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:38,190
I'll tell you what's next...

5
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,969
Okay.

6
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,410
Mr Malik wants to see Aunt.

7
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,839
What's the hurry? I ain't done yet...

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,944
Go...

9
00:01:47,944 --> 00:01:50,590
I'll send her in a sec...

10
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,931
Ie...

11
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,568
You played your move...

12
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,321
My turn now...

13
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,950
I'm punishing you for tormenting me...

14
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,936
That's what you think, innit?

15
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,673
No.

16
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,820
I'm punishing you for what you've been up to with Dr Rana!

17
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,433
Come.

18
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,172
Over here.

19
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:32,280
I want to take a good look at you... Back to full health...

20
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,930
A father's a lord...

21
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,748
Your wish is my command.

22
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,410
I wanted to say something...

23
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,800
Yes?

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,391
Go on...

25
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,334
If someone you trust...

26
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:53,410
And count among your dearest friends...

27
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:59,529
Pulls you into an embrace only to stab you in the back again and again...

28
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:03,669
Without you ever finding out...

29
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,817
What's the most tragic part of it?

30
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:11,154
It's all very tragic.

31
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:20,432
But perhaps never finding out that your enemy masquerades as your dearest friend is the most tragic.

32
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,240
And to find out...

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
Is the Lord's favour, yes?

34
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,406
Hmm...

35
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,904
Who are you talking about?

36
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:43,690
Promise me you won't stop me from punishing this enemy...

37
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:52,300
And that you'd thank the Lord without taking it to heart...

38
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:58,213
For the truth bows and waits to be heard in your court...

39
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,810
I promise.

40
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,470
My dear Zulaikha... Let the powerless worry...

41
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,690
I've started poisoning Malik Jr as you wanted...

42
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,765
Death will come to him like a fever... Just a slight cough... Before a sudden and painful death.

43
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,700
For a moment, I thought the codger got his ticket...

44
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:42,810
I know just what can put him to sleep... Awaiting orders.

45
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,340
No... Not just yet...

46
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,658
My husband goes first.

47
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,678
It's nearly this man's time anyway...

48
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:53,760
And then?

49
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,989
We'll seize the day...

50
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:01,270
And live our life... Our way... Together...

51
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,218
No, Dad.

52
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:11,686
You promised me you'll let me sort it out my way.

53
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,481
You promised me you won't take it to heart.

54
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,220
Okay.

55
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,658
Masooma...

56
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,859
Masooma...?

57
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,720
What happened dear? Why are you crying? Tell me, I'm so worried!

58
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,440
Dad...

59
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,148
No one wants to play with me...

60
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,500
We thought we'd play hide and seek...

61
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,587
But everyone chose to hide from me... For real...

62
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:07,187
And -- When I called Mishil...

63
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:15,230
She said her Mum had told them not to play with me because I've grown up...

64
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:21,961
When I asked if she's coming over, she said, 'Never'...

65
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,970
Dad...

66
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,099
My dear...
-I haven't grown up, have I?

67
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,989
Wait.

68
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,408
You don't need to earwig...

69
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,400
When you can just ask...

70
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,683
I'd gladly tell you everything I'm going to do.

71
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,058
I'm going to my lawyer...

72
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:24,720
Sort out some matters about inheritance...

73
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,138
Sort out my marriage... File for divorce.

74
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:35,280
Sort things out with Dr Rana by killing him...

75
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,590
And finally sort out my issues with my wife... Punish her for what she's done...

76
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,796
Before marrying my English rose... You.

77
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,983
In your dreams.

78
00:08:49,358 --> 00:08:53,212
What?
-Our marriage.

79
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:56,353
<i>Our</i> marriage...

80
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:59,961
Thank you for saying we're but one...

81
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:03,362
But I wonder why you refuse...

82
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:06,196
I love someone else.

83
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,680
Don't worry. I'll sort him out too.

84
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,663
Hello?
-Ie, where are you?

85
00:09:52,663 --> 00:09:55,895
Going to see Shayan.
-Get back here.

86
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,560
What happened?
-Malik Jr's gonna kill Dr Rana.

87
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,768
Ask him to hide somewhere... Leave this place...
-What?

88
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:07,450
For the love of God, could you just cut the questions? Dr Rana's in danger. You don't have time.

89
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,502
But why?

90
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,879
Okay.

91
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,240
Munna!

92
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,370
Yeah?
-Get me the keys!

93
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:20,996
No idea. I don't know where they keep it!
-Find it! You got to! Someone's life is at risk!

94
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,157
Try there.

95
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,540
No luck?

96
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,288
Where could it be?

97
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,985
Come...

98
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,080
My dear Zulaikha... Let the powerless worry...

99
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,600
I've started poisoning Malik Jr as you wanted...

100
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,441
Death will come to him like a fever... Just a slight cough... Before a sudden and painful death.

101
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,123
Close the door.

102
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,938
What happened?
-Where d'you keep the keys?

103
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:58,540
No idea. What happened?
-Find it. I want it before this moment!

104
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,950
What happened? We're so worried...

105
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,700
Your Tad asked Qutbuddin to get some rope and coal. Your Mam's locked in and I smell ashes!
-What?

106
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,962
Hush!

107
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:12,545
Grandpa won't let us open the door if he found out.
-Mum...

108
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:17,748
But we haven't got the keys.
-Well then, we gotta find them! Double time!

109
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,200
Check here. I'll look downstairs.
-Aye.

110
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,680
Mum!

111
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,480
Mum? You alright?

112
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,979
Say something!

113
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,733
Mum!

114
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:47,530
You haven't got time to waste, Doc... I'm here to help you, so if you can't let me in, could you just come out here for a second?

115
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,229
What if I don't?

116
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,670
Your misfortune...

117
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,433
If I did?
-You'll be saved.

118
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,344
Found it?
-No.

119
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,960
What happened?

120
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,748
Malik Jr's locked his wife in the room and I smell ashes...

121
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,601
He slapped her before me...

122
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:28,270
And we can't find the keys to this lock...

123
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,300
I've got some spares... Try those.

124
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,046
Here.

125
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,600
Try this one.

126
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,662
God help us all...

127
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,625
Lemme try!

128
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,577
Mum!

129
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,184
Mum!
-Mum?

130
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,000
Mum!
-Mum's gone to the loo!

131
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,119
Got out this way...

132
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,490
Where's she?
-Somewhere that's safe...

133
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,490
Why'd she leave her phone?

134
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,156
First time you've asked me to see you.

135
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:09,362
Everything's not alright, innit?

136
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:15,401
You're two steps ahead of your thoughts.
-And you read fortunes without reading palms...

137
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,531
Leave this place.

138
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,280
I don't know whether I should be laughing... Or shocked...

139
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,315
Nothing, as long as you leave this place.

140
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,854
Why?

141
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,731
Your life.

142
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:36,087
What's the worst that could happen?

143
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,863
He's gonna kill you.

144
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:42,370
Who?

145
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,619
He?

146
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,534
He's up there...

147
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:51,610
What do you know what He's got planned?

148
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,054
I've got my reasons to believe so.

149
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,170
Goodbye.

150
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:04,360
Talking about death and wishing me God be with ye...

151
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,796
I'm praying I don't have to pray for you.

152
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,870
Take care.

153
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,030
I won't run away so easily!

154
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,430
I'm gonna look it in the eye!

155
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,820
Have it your way...

156
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,033
Mum will be back. Don't worry...

157
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,130
Aliya...

158
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,366
Get up. Have some water... Here.

159
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,550
Mum... When'd we see her?

160
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,935
Mum... When'd she come back?

161
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,741
She'll be back...

162
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,899
Don't worry... Easy...

163
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,340
I've got the courage, Mr Khan...

164
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,950
I can face whatever's thrown at me.

165
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,250
All I lack...

166
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,639
Is the courage to see you worried...

167
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,352
I beg you, Mr Khan...

168
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:59,050
Please... Don't worry yourself...

169
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,810
Shayan spews venom with every word...

170
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,742
Every syllable kills me...

171
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,020
His eyes mock me... Saying...

172
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,550
That I've been cruel...

173
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,940
To my own daughter...

174
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,363
I've saved her, Khawar...

175
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:45,205
She's got a right to everything that's mine...

176
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,890
I've prayed a lot...

177
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,650
That He give me a son...

178
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:58,630
He gave me everything I never wished for...

179
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,973
But never gave me what I always wished for...

180
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,063
A son...

181
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,500
This land is like my mother...

182
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,860
I can't even think of giving it to anyone...

183
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,949
I can't give away my mother...

184
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,600
But I couldn't turn the Reverend down either...

185
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,933
You've got your way out where you live.

186
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,426
I don't get it, Reverend...?

187
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,466
Your nephew...

188
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,116
Your family can retain everything it owns.

189
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,550
I'm sorry for saying this, but...

190
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:05,780
For someone as upright as you, the land you own is like your mother...

191
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,990
Don't let Shayan go back without getting him married.

192
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,730
But -- Reverend... He leaves in two days...

193
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,526
And Masooma's too young!

194
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:27,000
The trouble that awaits you...

195
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,680
Is too great for you...

196
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:37,881
Your daughter's age... Or averting your destruction... It is up to you...

197
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,852
Which is why I say again - do not let him go back without getting him married.

198
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,970
As you say, Reverend...

199
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,790
You did the right thing, Mr Khan...

200
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,650
I'll always stand by you.

201
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,980
Hello?

202
00:22:23,784 --> 00:22:25,195
Yeah...

203
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,869
Yeah, I'd need backup... Two or three men...

204
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:33,117
Okay.

205
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,795
I'll call you as soon as I'm in the city.

206
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:40,941
Thank you, sir. Bye.

207
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,510
Who's here so late?

208
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,596
You're here so late?

209
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:08,060
Yeah.

210
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,780
Believe your eyes.

211
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,486
Step aside...

212
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:36,121
I thought I'd dress up like this when I - God forbid - got married... But thank goodness that never happened... Why does it feel like I'm looking death in the eye today?

213
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:52,323
You know, don't you?
-Who?

214
00:23:52,323 --> 00:23:54,486
You know why.

215
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,801
No.

216
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:00,797
I know you know everything.

217
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,083
Roshni...

218
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,915
I've got my reasons for saying no.

219
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:10,980
Just speak your heart out.

220
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:18,010
Mum jumped from the window, risking her life to save herself from the fire...

221
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,650
You're the only one here who doesn't have any questions...

222
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,609
You haven't got time, Roshni...

223
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:31,502
Can't waste it looking for answers...

224
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:39,302
Start praying that your Mam's fine before you blink again.

225
00:24:39,302 --> 00:24:43,892
She's made a run for her life.

226
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,180
For the love of God... Just tell me what you know...

227
00:24:51,530 --> 00:25:01,427
The purest thing God ever made is the respect kids have for their parents.

228
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:05,410
My respect for that purity keeps me quiet.

229
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:10,425
So please... Don't ask why and start praying.

230
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,716
Yes, Doc?

231
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,330
Two cups, clean as crystal...

232
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,534
Some milk, and teabags...

233
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:42,771
A kettle of hot water and one and a half teaspoons of sugar...

234
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,420
Put it up there to welcome our guest.

235
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,626
It's someone very special.

236
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,060
I'd like to serve him nothing but the finest tea.

237
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,180
Go.

238
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,193
Why didn't you tell me before?

239
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,530
I love you so much.

240
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:14,303
Don't you love Mehek?

241
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:20,230
She gave you her life... And her family's honour...

242
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,820
You've got me in a fix...

243
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,959
I can't say you're wrong even though I know you are...

244
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:36,940
Because my misfortune is just as guilty as you.

245
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,795
No. This isn't your fault.

246
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,430
Saving your marr --

247
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,440
Protecting your happiness... It's my duty...

248
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,700
You've been through so much...

249
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,520
You suffered so much...

250
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,730
But didn't even let out a sigh...

251
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,970
Brothers don't need strength to carry the weight of their sisters' troubles.

252
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,777
They just need a heart that beats.

253
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:17,079
Shayan...

254
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:30,280
For the love of the Lord... For the sake of your sister's honour... Promise me you'll reward Mehek's devoted love and long wait by giving her the happiness she deserves.

255
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,740
Orders, Doc?

256
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,500
Is Mr Malik here?
-No.

257
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,320
But Mrs Malik was here.

258
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,783
What'd you say?

259
00:27:57,783 --> 00:28:00,720
Everything you'd told me.

260
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Tell me properly. I want to be sure you didn't forget something.

261
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:15,090
I told her that the Doctor said I should tell her he doesn't want to meet, see, or have anything to do with you.

262
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,638
What'd she say?

263
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,340
She was quiet...

264
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,610
Eyes dripping...

265
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,942
I saw one drop fall...

266
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:30,410
But I shut the door...

267
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,614
But I shut the door before a second could fall.

268
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,675
Good.

269
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,958
Go.

270
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,400
You're done for the day.

271
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,480
Don't weep for the living!

272
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,819
Just thank God she made a run for her life!

273
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,569
Tell her, will you?

274
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,821
Hello?

275
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:30,113
Aye, I'm in the city.

276
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:31,638
Okay.

277
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:34,920
I sent you the address. Get there ASAP.

278
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,706
Thank you.

279
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,260
What now?

280
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,417
The flames of rebellion shall rise...

281
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,339
I'm with you.

282
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,650
I know.

283
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,977
Get off, Qutbuddin...

284
00:30:14,977 --> 00:30:18,995
I don't think you should be coming with me.

285
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,941
Okay.

286
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,200
If it isn't the esteemed Mr Malik! Come in!

287
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,780
On his feet! I see you don't need a wheelchair anymore?

288
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,470
Glad to see you.

289
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,500
Please, take a seat...

290
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,968
Touched to see your delight...

291
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,020
Hmm?

292
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,840
One of Shayan's friends is here to see him.

293
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,489
His friend?

294
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,470
Where's Khawar?

295
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,580
He said he'll be back tomorrow.

296
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,170
What's his name?

297
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,704
Adam.

298
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,810
Who are you?

299
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,668
A guest.

300
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:14,996
Want to see Dad?

301
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:16,562
Mr Khan?

302
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:17,724
Yeah.

303
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:20,020
You're Shayan's sister?

304
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,067
He's not my brother anymore.

305
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:26,660
What do you mean?

306
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,258
We've gotten married... How can he be my brother now?

307
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,822
Anything else?

308
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:47,900
He said he's a friend from University. Here from London.

309
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,320
Mentioned a few other friends too... Class-fellows, roommates...

310
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,240
Sohail, Mehek, and Khadim...

311
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,650
Don't let Shayan find out.

312
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,198
Where's Adam?

313
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:09,190
I asked you something!

314
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,017
In the lounge.

315
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,052
I never made tea for anyone...

316
00:33:27,052 --> 00:33:30,270
You're the first to have the honour...

317
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,890
And I swear...

318
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,118
I'm so glad to be serving you.

319
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:41,183
Your humble servant is delighted.

320
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,532
What are you doing here?
-Mehek sent you?
-Yeah.

321
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:04,077
(Don't mention her before him, okay?) Lovely surprise, mate! It's Christmas!

322
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:07,264
'Evening.
-Good evening.

323
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:09,500
You're his Uncle?

324
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,031
Yeah.

325
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,000
He loved to talk about you.

326
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,462
Did he?
-Gotta say, you're rather famous 'round here! I just asked where you live... But they wanted to drop me here themselves!

327
00:34:18,462 --> 00:34:26,370
Gotta say, you're rather famous 'round here! I just asked where you live... But they wanted to drop me here themselves!

328
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,820
I heard odes to your glory all the way.

329
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,892
Please, take a seat. I'll get you some tea.

330
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:39,339
Shayan... Come with me...

331
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:42,312
No, thanks, Mr Khan...

332
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:46,700
I'd love to show my guest some kindness.

333
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:52,088
I won't hear a no from such an honoured guest!

334
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,221
Shayan?

335
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,170
Take a seat.
-Thank you.

336
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,906
We've had our tea...

337
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:21,079
Looking each other in the eye...

338
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,878
Saying not a word, hearing not a word...

339
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,210
I'm still thinking of where to start...

340
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:38,142
Start wherever you want... I'm sure it'll end up making sense. Please, begin in the Lord's name.

341
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,532
Third time I'm thanking you...

342
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,600
Thank you for treating me... Getting me back on my feet...

343
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,470
Oh...

344
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,171
I couldn't help it...

345
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,290
I thought it's pronounced 'It was my duty'.

346
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,930
I thought it's pronounced 'It was my duty'.
-No.

347
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,954
No.

348
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,491
I know and mean exactly what I'm saying.

349
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,870
I've sinned a thousand times...

350
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,346
But lying is not one of them.

351
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,230
Thank you for the fourth time...

352
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:30,860
The most priceless of trust is that between husband and wife...

353
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,730
Cursed are those...

354
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:44,640
Who leave this world, unaware that their wives...

355
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,200
Chose to two-time shamelessly right under their noses...

356
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,160
Why'd you stop at wives?

357
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,249
I've seen a few cheating women...

358
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,980
But countless more cheating men...

359
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,510
Only because...

360
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,900
I'm talking about <i>my</i> wife...

361
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
