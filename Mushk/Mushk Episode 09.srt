1
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,160
I don't know what to say.

2
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,104
You don't need to.

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,500
Just... Be happy...

4
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,699
I'll get going...

5
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,978
Adam...

6
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:55,840
Wouldn't you like some tea?

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,768
In the evening...

8
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,778
Sure.

9
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:04,062
Alright.

10
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:06,005
Take care.

11
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,948
That's dresses and sweets for everyone...

12
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:33,555
One for Aunt... And one for Mr Noor...

13
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,711
And this one for my daughter-in-law.

14
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:42,065
I'm gonna give Mehek 20,000.

15
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:43,626
Guria!

16
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,563
We leave after the prayer.

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,775
The Lord will bless us for what's to come.

18
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,135
Of course. I've taken care of everything. I've even got something for the servants.

19
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:56,133
They're very well-off... I hope they're happy with it.

20
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:59,487
My son's getting what he always wished for!

21
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:08,010
The kind of son who'd rather stay hungry than bother anyone else...

22
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,850
His heart's as white and soft as a cotton ball...

23
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,968
Well, his patience has been rewarded...

24
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:20,468
The dream that he always had will now be his reality.

25
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,868
Hello, Mum.
-Hello.
-Hey.

26
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:31,900
I've kept things for charity. Keep it on the terrace after he's blessed it. It'll ward the evil eye off him if the birds had it.

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,017
I'll go get it.

28
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,410
You didn't have to do all of this, Mum.

29
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,958
Please don't be so happy...

30
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,698
I mean...

31
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:49,695
We don't need to be so... Extravagant...

32
00:02:49,695 --> 00:02:51,806
What are you saying?

33
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:58,093
It's the happiest day in the life of my only son!

34
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:03,583
Were it up to me, I'd provide for every being in every corner of the city.

35
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,447
Not so fast!

36
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,849
Over here.
-Eh?

37
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:14,053
C'mon.

38
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,460
Done?

39
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,600
Thanks to You, O Lord, I live to see this day.

40
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,530
The Reverend's here after ages.

41
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,157
Come with me...

42
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,136
He'd bless you.

43
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,863
I think I'll pass.

44
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:56,352
I said you're coming, so you better come!

45
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:15,018
No, doctor... Please spare me... For the love of God...

46
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:22,670
Don't give me another shot... It only makes me worse!

47
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,080
This shot's going to relieve you forever, sir.

48
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,480
I don't think you'd need any more than... Five, maybe?

49
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,050
Then, you can kiss all your troubles, pains, and misery goodbye, farewell, adieu... Forever.

50
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,130
I don't want another shot!

51
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,830
No way, Zulaikha!
-Stop being childish!

52
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:57,580
Zulaikha! Tell him I don't want another shot! I don't! Not ANOTHER!

53
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,124
There, now... That's all it was...

54
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:04,459
Doctor!

55
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
I knew there was something dodgy going on here... And in Aunt's mind!

56
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,880
Let go...

57
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,926
That's all...

58
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,690
Doc --

59
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,197
Ehh...

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,908
Give him some water.

61
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:33,937
I'll take my leave.

62
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,944
Come in.

63
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,741
How are you?

64
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,926
Fine...

65
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,639
You wanted to see me?

66
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:15,588
Yes... Someone's coming here with a proposal for my girl today...

67
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:26,468
I want you to prepare for a welcome so warm they know we accept before we even say a word.

68
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,610
Who's the proposal for?

69
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,354
Mehek.

70
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,305
Who is it?

71
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:41,297
Adam's mother is coming.

72
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,791
Mind if I ask you something?

73
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,861
Not at all?

74
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:58,885
How do you know they're coming if they haven't already proposed?

75
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:01,935
Just do as I said.

76
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,640
Okay.

77
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,006
Take care.
-Take care.

78
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,122
At last...

79
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:41,260
I swear, I tried to stop myself from paying a visit in your thoughts...

80
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,180
But, I guess...

81
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,331
It didn't work...

82
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,020
Something's come up.

83
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,634
Yes?

84
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:58,920
You mentioned a match for Roshni two months ago... The charming boy from the family on easy street, remember?

85
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,807
I said she's gonna study further.

86
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,162
Yeah. What is it?

87
00:09:06,648 --> 00:09:11,890
Tell them we accept their proposal...

88
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,551
As long as they can come here today!

89
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,998
Today?

90
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,750
Right now.

91
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,740
My honour is at stake...

92
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,994
And yours...

93
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll do something.

94
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,504
Wait!

95
00:09:41,504 --> 00:09:43,470
Over here.

96
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,386
I hear Adam's family is coming here to propose your marriage?

97
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,350
No idea.

98
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,987
Really? Way to run the show, then.

99
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,316
What do you mean?

100
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:14,866
The man with you that night... Was it, by any chance... Adam?

101
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:19,500
The night you besmirched my pure and sinless daughter's name.

102
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,746
The Lord knows every truth.

103
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:27,948
Funnily, some liars know it too.

104
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:36,690
I'm sure time will clear everything up... And when it does, the weight of your lies will stay your tongue. And these questions shall be silenced.

105
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,128
You know, I sometimes wonder...

106
00:13:07,128 --> 00:13:16,207
How your son would feel when he grows up and his friends constantly remind him his Mam's past...

107
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:20,502
What've I done that'd embarrass Shahmir?

108
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:22,541
Oooh... Big words...

109
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,603
Lemme give you an example...

110
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:30,930
Let's say he's in Year 11, and he gets into a row with a friend...

111
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:45,980
He has the strength to fight back and the finest four-letter-words to mouth, but don't you think it'd burst his bubble of courage, strength, and ego if someone asked him about his Tad?

112
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,504
Then again, I know how clever you are... You'll come up with something!

113
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,640
So... How clever am I?

114
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:12,695
Got a Mam for hire. Got Adam for hire. I'm sure it ain't that hard for you to get him a Tad for hire.

115
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,975
You're artful, I give you that!

116
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,648
I've got my cloak, Mum...

117
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,002
I don't need to put it on before Aliya.

118
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:53,340
It's not a cloak...

119
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,704
It's a request...

120
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:58,580
An imploration...

121
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,520
A prayer... A mother's prayer to her daughter...

122
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,351
What are you saying, Mum?

123
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,150
I can't bear the sin of making you beg me...

124
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:15,809
Your mother's dignity and honour are in your hands.

125
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,528
Please... Guard them well...

126
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,767
What do you want me to do?

127
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,110
Someone's coming with a proposal for you in the evening.

128
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,738
They're very good people. Please, accept it.

129
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,183
But how?

130
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,373
And why?

131
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:38,002
I just can't...

132
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,393
No...

133
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:48,148
You leave me with no choice but to end my life!

134
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:54,336
May I try Saqib's number... Just once?

135
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,253
Okay.

136
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,086
I pray he answers it.

137
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,690
Now, don't answer if you get a call from her number. Her Mam calls you to check.

138
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,595
Your turn, Saqib... What are you waiting for?

139
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,280
What happened?

140
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,527
He rejected my call.

141
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,003
Mum...

142
00:16:51,003 --> 00:16:55,583
Mum... I can't watch you cry...

143
00:16:55,583 --> 00:17:01,089
Then ask your sister to say yes and wipe my tears!

144
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:08,357
My mouth can't utter it...

145
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,898
You can take it as my silent acceptance...

146
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,006
My girl...

147
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,394
Dad...

148
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,952
Yes?

149
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,792
Is everything ready?

150
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:05,160
Yes. I've also done what you asked me to do two days back.

151
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,981
What?

152
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:15,927
Someone's got a proposal for Roshni. It's a very good family. I like them. They're coming to see you this evening.

153
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:19,781
Good. Very good indeed.

154
00:18:19,781 --> 00:18:22,307
I'll make ready, then.

155
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,116
Thank you, O Lord...

156
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,920
Don't take anything Guddi says seriously.

157
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,594
She says anything...

158
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,953
You're my son.

159
00:18:47,953 --> 00:18:50,190
You're me.

160
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,508
I won't let anything happen to you.

161
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,236
You're innocent.

162
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:02,081
An angel...

163
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:06,888
The Lord won't let your prayers go unanswered.

164
00:19:08,386 --> 00:19:13,780
Plead with Him in His court with your little hands...

165
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:23,921
Tell Him the moments weigh on your mother like eons.

166
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,867
Tell Him she's tired... Broken...

167
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,998
Pray to Him...

168
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:47,918
Ask Him to help me find your Dad...

169
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:54,820
My prayers don't seem to work...

170
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,977
As if they're cursed to never reach Him...

171
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,084
Pray for me, will you?

172
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:11,740
You're my boy...

173
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,884
You're me...

174
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,140
What's he doing with you?

175
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,977
Well...

176
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:30,626
His mother's -- In the kitchen -- To get something...

177
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,292
Something's not right...

178
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,950
Uh...

179
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,610
What?

180
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:44,786
If you ask me, it looks far more like you're Guddi's maid than the other way around!

181
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,138
Anyway... There's something you need to know.

182
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:56,700
The Lord has blessed my Roshni with a wonderful match. They'll be here in the evening.

183
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:03,680
Tell your dearest Adam he better not show up before they're gone!

184
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,310
But -- Aunt --
-That will be all.

185
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,957
You better not say you don't even talk to him...

186
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:14,180
Because I'm not falling for this one... Not now...

187
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,340
Such undying love...

188
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,282
Seldom lets you fall out of touch...

189
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,876
I hope we're clear.

190
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,088
I'm thinking of fielding you in the election...

191
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:44,210
What do you say?

192
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,067
Think about it, okay? Go.

193
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,698
Yes, Munshi? Did you talk to Hatim?

194
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey...

195
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,208
He's gone.

196
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,123
He was old, you know...

197
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:22,071
He fought Asher Khan's tyranny and his loneliness until his last breath...

198
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:30,286
He survived the last year and a half thanks to you...

199
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,600
His loneliness took over him the moment you came here...

200
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,220
And his solitude took his life...

201
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,547
Mr Khan!

202
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,580
Mr Khan!

203
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,823
What is it?

204
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:53,144
The prisoner's dead.

205
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,610
How?

206
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,934
No idea.

207
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:02,930
Where the devil were you?

208
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,360
Come. We need to get rid of the body.

209
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,715
Come.

210
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,340
Please, come in.

211
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,760
Here.

212
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,986
Good evening.
-Good evening.

213
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:42,040
Good evening, Mr Malik. How are you?
-Good evening. Please, sit.

214
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,250
Thank you.

215
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,497
'Evening.
-'Evening.

216
00:23:45,497 --> 00:23:49,320
They're the ones I told Mrs Zulaikha about.

217
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,619
Bless you. Pleasure to meet you.

218
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,474
Dead?

219
00:24:05,474 --> 00:24:07,159
Yes, Mr Khan.

220
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,894
What do we do with the body?

221
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:19,745
The priest would make sure the entire town hears it... We need to do something else...

222
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:22,655
I'll pray for his soul.

223
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,697
Munshi...
-Sir?

224
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,980
We'll bury him around here.

225
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,457
Get the gravedigger.

226
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:38,005
Yes, sir.

227
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,734
So glad to see you... You may not know it but your grandfather and I are friends from college.

228
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:41,985
Wow... That's wonderful...
-Indeed...

229
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:46,100
I'll bring Roshni here.
-Sure.

230
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:58,380
And how are you doing, Mr Malik?
-Fine, with His blessings.
-I hope you're taking your pills on time.
-Of course.

231
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,379
Bless her.

232
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:09,599
She's lovely. Come.

233
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:28,243
She's just the type I wanted for my son.

234
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:37,000
I know just what you're gonna say next!

235
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,654
Pray tell?

236
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:42,410
You're gonna say, 'We accept her'.

237
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,985
Of course. We're just waiting for Mr Malik's reply.

238
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:54,060
You're leaving for England in 15 days. When are you coming back?

239
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,973
A year from now? Two at the most.

240
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:01,099
A year?

241
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:03,559
Isn't it too long?

242
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:12,121
I'm eagerly waiting to get him married off. They can get married next week if it's fine with you.

243
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:15,864
I want him to take her to England with her.

244
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:18,948
That's great.

245
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:25,691
I'll ask for a day's time. I'll tell you tomorrow.

246
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:29,872
It's for the best.
-Okay.
-Alright.

247
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,928
I'm going...

248
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,420
To bury him...

249
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,179
Make sure he's comfortable, okay?

250
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,438
He's lived a hard life...

251
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,946
Lower him gently...

252
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,300
Consider these the first thing I gave my love...

253
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:57,430
Take care of them... Treat them with respect befitting royalty.

254
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,720
O God, the Creator and Redeemer...

255
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:37,833
Tell the gravedigger to keep his trap shut... Any way you see fit!

256
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,047
Okay?

257
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,028
Shall we lower him?

258
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,918
Yeah. Go.

259
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,354
In your hands, Oh Lord,

260
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:54,675
We humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.

261
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,860
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;

262
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,585
Deliver them now from every evil

263
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:03,086
And bid them eternal rest.

264
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:06,636
Forever and ever. Amen.

265
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,887
Okay, that's enough...

266
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,875
What happened, sir?

267
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,783
Ma'am! They're here! They're here, sir!

268
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:00,804
Keep it there.

269
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,077
Hello.
-Hello.

270
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:10,260
How are you?

271
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:16,550
Hello.
-Hello. How are you?
-Bless you. Come.

272
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,547
Please, have some.

273
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,587
Thank you so much.

274
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:05,068
Excuse me for speaking so freely... But we've come here with a lot of hope...

275
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:13,067
I'm here to ask for your daughter Mehek's hand in matrimony for my son, Adam.

276
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,160
Don't worry...

277
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,525
I'll care for Mehek like my own daughter... If not more!

278
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,407
We've got many hopes... Please don't turn us down.

279
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:40,051
There'd be very few men in the world like Adam.

280
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:47,963
My Mehek would be very fortunate to have someone like him.

281
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:50,094
So you accept?

282
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:53,971
Of course. I'm chuffed.

283
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,763
I was thinking if you've asked Mehek...

284
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:09,667
I know my girl... She knows what I decide will be best for her.

285
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:17,013
I don't think I'll ever find a better family for her than you.

286
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,182
Roshni's fiancé doesn't live in Pakistan.

287
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:41,260
They're insisting because of, or should I say, forced by the fact that he won't be back for a couple of years - his job won't allow it - that they be married as soon as possible...

288
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:48,954
They don't have time. They'd rather have them married off in two weeks.

289
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,457
If you wouldn't mind...

290
00:33:53,148 --> 00:33:56,430
Of course not.

291
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:59,040
But I do...

292
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,515
Yes?

293
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:15,065
Mr Malik... Before he passed away, Dad had me promise...

294
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:22,190
That I'd get my sister married off before I get married... And she's just started her bachelor's...

295
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,960
So I thought if we could get some time...

296
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:36,813
I'd rather... Mehek and I can get engaged when Roshni gets married... It'd give us some time...

297
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,817
I can understand.

298
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,993
Your father was a close friend of mine.

299
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,042
I know.

300
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,870
It's my duty to honour his promise.

301
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,187
Thank you.

302
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,273
Too bad the lights had to go out at this delightful moment!

303
00:34:56,273 --> 00:35:04,620
I told you not to vote for that bloke! But you didn't listen to me.

304
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,680
Go and turn the generator on.
-I'll go have a look.

305
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,470
I'll go have a look.
-No, Qutbuddin will take care of it.

306
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,160
No, Qutbuddin will take care of it.
-No problem.
-Yeah, go.

307
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,983
No problem.
-Yeah, go.

308
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,909
He's your son.

309
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:16,729
A son-in-law's just like a son.
-Of course.
-Munna!

310
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:18,574
Munna!

311
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,137
Munna!

312
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:26,095
Yeah, Adam?

313
00:35:27,028 --> 00:35:28,653
Why isn't the generator on yet?

314
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:32,390
It's out of petrol! Just a minute!

315
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,431
Hurry up!

316
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:56,160
Would you look who we have here! Adam! Oh wait, you don't know him, do you? Let me tell you...

317
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,960
I'm sure <i>you</i> know who he is though. Your wife-to-be's son!

318
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,511
Lower your voice before someone hears you!

319
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:05,510
Aww, not so fast, bytt!

320
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,650
You haven't even met your almost-stepson yet!

321
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,859
Shahmir... Adam. The man for hire.

322
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:18,775
For hire... Don't you get it?

323
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:20,108
Let me put you wise.

324
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:30,840
Like cars, tents, and labour for hire, your Mam's got herself a husband for hire... Your Tad for hire!

325
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,367
He's her man for hire!

326
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,944
That's right.

327
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:43,428
I'm a man for hire.

328
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:51,600
But I'm here to help someone out. Lend a hand.

329
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:58,632
I've been hired for this job by my Lord, and I'm doing this to earn His reward.

330
00:36:58,632 --> 00:37:02,414
As if what you're doing is worth rewarding!

331
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:05,840
Can't believe you think He'd reward you for getting engaged to a married woman!

332
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,560
Look at yourself... And look at her, hiding her face in her nods!

333
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,240
You seriously think you're earning His favour?

334
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:20,799
Gentle reminder, your shoulder devil's having a hard time keeping up with your long list of sins!

335
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,556
Gotta say, though...

336
00:37:28,556 --> 00:37:31,050
In darkness and light... You look lush!

337
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,853
Mind if I take a good look?

338
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,890
Aye?

339
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,900
That isn't the sweet smell of happiness... It's gunpowder!

340
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:58,880
I'm just waiting for it to get to Aunt's room... Engulf this entire place...

341
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,120
Before I light the fuse!

342
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:06,000
For now, though... Gotta write more scenes for our heroic villain, Saqib!

343
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
