1
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,470
Grandpa! Please! Open the door! Please give me a chance to explain...

2
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:47,550
I never cared one bit about the ways of this village for you...

3
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,278
I sent you to London to study when no one sent their daughters even to Karachi!

4
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:17,110
My heart says you haven't done anything... But my eyes and ears testify against you... It feels like someone torched everything I've built before my eyes... Disgraced me...

5
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:24,537
Please, Grandpa... Open the door! Grandpa!

6
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,150
Grandpa! I haven't done anything, I --

7
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,988
Grandpa!

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,378
I --

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,840
Grandpa...

10
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,580
By your love... I don't even know who he was!

11
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,250
I just heard some noise... And saw him with Roshni wh --

12
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,861
Enough of your lies!

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,965
Enough of your big, bad, white lies!

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:15,900
I can tell you, Dad... We didn't tell you the story so it doesn't trouble you... Let me tell you what I saw her doing!

15
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,980
Aunt!

16
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,291
Easy there, girl... Let me do the talking.

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,531
I heard the flowerpot fall. I walked slowly...

18
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:34,660
I heard laughter as I approached...

19
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,000
I leaned from behind the wall...

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,090
And saw them holding hands...

21
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,560
He freed one hand, swept the hair on her head aside, and leaned closer...

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
Grandpa!

23
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,100
G -- Grandpa!

24
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,950
Are you alright?

25
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,180
What happened?

26
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,628
Grandpa... Please!

27
00:02:55,628 --> 00:03:01,079
Hang in there, I'll get the doctor!

28
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,548
Dad?

29
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:40,028
I haven't told you my story to let my tears give you company when you're out...

30
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,138
Wipe your tears...

31
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:48,988
Eyes on your destination...

32
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,380
Take it slow...

33
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:02,419
The devil wins when you get too hasty...

34
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:11,159
Asher Khan and the devil are inseparable bedfellows...

35
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,680
Take it slow...

36
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,938
And I'm sure you'll win...

37
00:04:19,938 --> 00:04:22,528
Yeah, you will...

38
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,039
I'll free you.

39
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,229
I don't want to be free.

40
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,109
Not now...

41
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:47,310
I'll be happy to hear your love story didn't end so...

42
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,911
Tragically...

43
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,668
'It is time'...

44
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:07,760
My breaths tell me everyday...

45
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,660
Any breath could be my last...

46
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,800
Any moment...

47
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,860
My time...

48
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,290
But you...

49
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,360
Time is on your side...

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,828
Be patient... And don't make haste...

51
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:44,468
Don't... Make haste...

52
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,319
You'll prevail...

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,880
His blood pressure dropped...

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,910
It could've been dangerous...

55
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,320
If I got late...

56
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,250
He's safe now.

57
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,321
Get these pills. Make sure he takes them on time.

58
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,880
He's fine, isn't he, doctor?
-Of course. Except circulation, that is...

59
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,300
His heart isn't pumping as hard as it should.

60
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,810
But don't worry. I've given him a pill for it. Don't worry.

61
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,968
I'll take my leave.

62
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:39,517
Take the doctor to his car, Munna.

63
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,647
Please...

64
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,712
Grandpa...

65
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,620
Something going on here?

66
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,689
Who told you?

67
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,690
No one. You're gonna tell me. What happened?

68
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,831
Nothing.

69
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,572
Munna... Back to your room.
-Ma'am...

70
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,998
Bless you.

71
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:24,515
His blood pressure dropped? That all?

72
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,135
Yes.

73
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,997
For a moment, I thought the codger got his ticket...

74
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:37,770
I know just what can put him to sleep... Awaiting orders.

75
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,329
No...

76
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,488
Not just yet...

77
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,319
My husband goes first.

78
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,880
It's nearly this man's time anyway...

79
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,158
Goodbye.

80
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,520
Take care.

81
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,518
Back off!

82
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,608
Get away!

83
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,649
Grandpa...

84
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,559
Get out!

85
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,850
Out!

86
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:40,720
But -- Grandpa...
-If you value my life, get out of my sights!

87
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,878
Out!

88
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,567
Anything you need?

89
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,341
Saqib was here to see me...

90
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:36,141
But Mehek's been disgraced...

91
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:42,900
I'm responsible for what happened to Grandpa.

92
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,400
I should tell him everything...

93
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,388
Or my guilt won't let me sleep...

94
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,401
What were you thinking?

95
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:41,440
I asked you something!

96
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,297
Nothing...

97
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:50,988
Itching to tell the truth, eh? Your guilt led you downstairs, didn't it?

98
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,780
How much do you value my life?

99
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,028
What are you saying, Mum?

100
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,639
Mum...

101
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:13,901
I swear, I'll slit my wrist if your dratted affair tainted my upbringing!

102
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,030
What can I do?
-Well, shut up, for starters!

103
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,372
Guard my honour in exchange for a life with him.

104
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,448
I told you I'll see him.

105
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,250
A life without guilt... Or without him...

106
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,388
It is up to you.

107
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
Back to your room!

108
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,560
Anything you need?

109
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,333
No.

110
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:10,570
Want me to rub your feet? I'm sure the exhaustion's bothering you.

111
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,400
I told you. No.

112
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,019
Okay...

113
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,760
Oh I'd love smothering you!

114
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,830
You've killed every trace of humanity around you!

115
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,350
Well, guess what, your downfall's coming with a wedding procession!

116
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,631
You thinking what I'm thinking?

117
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,848
What?

118
00:12:40,408 --> 00:12:46,319
Like... Look at what this trifle did to your Grandpa...

119
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:55,289
I mean... I know it ain't really a trifle... A young girl getting caught seeing her lover at her place...

120
00:12:55,289 --> 00:13:00,600
I've heard people die for it... I've seen people kill for it...

121
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:09,501
But looking at your exploits in London... Getting married, having a son... Your husband running away...

122
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:13,030
Looking at all of that, this is kid stuff...

123
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,191
Newborn baby stuff, in fact...

124
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,780
Innit?

125
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,619
Give it to me... I'll take it...

126
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,968
Grandpa...

127
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,989
It's time for your medicine...

128
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:19,558
Here.

129
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,839
I don't need it.

130
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,340
Take it back!

131
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,378
Munna!

132
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,770
Clean up this mess, will you...

133
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,168
Good morning, sir!

134
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,484
'Morning.

135
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,904
How was the journey?

136
00:15:07,904 --> 00:15:11,030
Long... But effortless...

137
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,451
Good news, sir.

138
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,188
Yes?

139
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:20,750
Shayan's given in.

140
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,988
Okay.

141
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,301
Set him free tomorrow.

142
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,081
I want him just like he was...

143
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,640
The lad's back home after ages... It'd be a shame if it didn't look that way!

144
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,997
As you say, sir.

145
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,098
So it's you!

146
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,388
Yes.

147
00:16:19,388 --> 00:16:22,068
I never thought you'd be here.

148
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:29,699
Your mind would scare you... You'd think we may do something to you. You'd give in and turn off your phone.

149
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:34,069
I'd wait a while before going back.

150
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:39,070
You're right... My mind tried to scare me, and I gave in.

151
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,020
But...

152
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,911
But?

153
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:44,410
My heart...

154
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,010
My heart didn't.

155
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:57,610
It doesn't give two hoots about what the mind says... Or what I think... Or what my enemy may do.

156
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,011
It knows that we all gotta die someday.

157
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:07,891
So, I disappointed everyone but my heart and came here...

158
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,660
What d'you do when you don't blither?

159
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,601
Love and care for your daughter... And long to make her mine...

160
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,748
I meant your job.

161
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:20,589
I've got a job at this office...

162
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,250
How much do you earn?
-Around 40K.

163
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:32,220
That's enough for you to get your two square meals, dress up like this... And live comfortably?

164
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,250
And enough for me to be thankful to God.

165
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:50,760
Blimey... I'm sure you won't stop praying for a moment if you got one million to get out of my daughter's life.

166
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,481
You're wrong.

167
00:17:55,094 --> 00:18:01,525
Or... I can give half a million to any helpless bloke 'round here and get you out of the way.

168
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm staying away from sin.

169
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,700
I told you. I don't fear death.

170
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,950
But... I might give it a thought... For 2...

171
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:27,551
I knew you'd say 2 if I said 1, and 4 if I said 2...

172
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,970
So...

173
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,808
Here's 2 million for you.

174
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,871
Leave this place!

175
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,548
Easy there... Lie down.

176
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:05,279
Worst thing you can do to your health right now, Mr Malik, is get angry or worried...

177
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:10,690
I'm writing some pills for you... Don't forget to take them.

178
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,407
But remember they're only gonna work if you're at ease.

179
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:28,019
I hope you won't need it if you take these pills... But you know I'll be here if you need me.

180
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,341
Please let me know if you need anything.

181
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,800
Okay.

182
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,950
Take care.

183
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,390
Wonder what you're looking for...

184
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,272
Nothing?

185
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:05,543
Just...

186
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,134
Just... Looking around.

187
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:13,430
No you ain't. Looking at you, you're looking for something, you are!

188
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,531
And who'd you be?
-Looks like the poor little answer lost its way between the questions...

189
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,180
You don't look like a servant...

190
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,661
But then... Who are you? A guest?

191
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:33,909
Why don't I look like a servant?
-You'd be quieter if you were.

192
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:41,210
All these words and questions would've died before they could come out of your mouth.

193
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,868
So... Who are you?

194
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:52,388
Look for me the next time you're here. I'm sure you'll find me. I'll tell you who I am then. Deal?

195
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,679
Are you alright?

196
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,698
Yeah...

197
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:31,178
Why are you crying?

198
00:21:31,178 --> 00:21:36,569
I'm fine... Back to your studies... Don't act like Mum.

199
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,500
He got stuck on the way...

200
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,980
He called yesterday to tell me Shayan's coming back.

201
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,420
Wow! I've been waiting to see my bro for ages!

202
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,021
Come here...

203
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,890
I've told you not to call him 'bro'.

204
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,258
Why?

205
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:21,360
I can't tell you... But your Mum can. Go out and play for a while... I need to talk to her. Here.
-Okay.

206
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:33,280
You're a cold-blooded snake... Who else are you gonna bite?

207
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,131
There's something you must know...

208
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,540
Yes?

209
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:51,053
I've decided to get Masooma and Shayan married.

210
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,430
Didn't you think about their age for once?

211
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,740
I'd listen to you if I were asking...

212
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,647
But I'm just telling you my decision.

213
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,168
Prepare for the wedding.

214
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,090
Want something? I'm starving.

215
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,378
Okay, I'll go have something...

216
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,491
Where are you off to?
-I was hungry... Thought I'd have something...

217
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,011
Mum!

218
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,278
Here...

219
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:06,398
Did you see him?

220
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,760
I went there...

221
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,338
And?

222
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,031
He wasn't there...

223
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,792
What do you mean?

224
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,412
I went where he asked me to come...

225
00:24:21,412 --> 00:24:28,863
Called him like 50 times in half an hour... He answered at last... And said, 'I don't want to see you'.

226
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:30,843
I asked why.

227
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:34,684
He said... 'I don't want to', and hung up.

228
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,870
This number is switched off.

229
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,538
This number is switched off.
-I tried his number many times... But he didn't answer.

230
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:53,368
I tried his number many times... But he didn't answer.

231
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,680
But why?

232
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,520
I don't think he's the right man...

233
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,740
No way, Mum!

234
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,690
No way... I'll die without him...

235
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,368
I'm doing my best. Always have been, always will be.

236
00:25:11,368 --> 00:25:14,479
But he's running away from us.

237
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,950
Okay... Try calling him...

238
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,098
And don't worry... I'm always here for you.

239
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,719
This number is switched off.

240
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,301
I heard the flowerpot fall. I walked slowly...

241
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:17,172
I heard laughter as I approached...

242
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:20,470
I leaned from behind the wall...

243
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,360
And saw them holding hands...

244
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:30,061
He freed one hand, swept the hair on her head aside, and leaned closer...

245
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:40,611
If you value my life, get out of my sights! Out!

246
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,997
I don't get it.

247
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,837
Look...

248
00:26:51,697 --> 00:27:01,329
I'm not accusing anyone or holding anyone guilty...

249
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:12,110
But the walls of this manor which have stood testament to the honour and integrity of our family...

250
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,941
Have been defiled by the filthy footsteps that dared to vault them.

251
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,981
I couldn't sleep last night...

252
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:37,050
I've decided to get Roshni and Mehek married off as soon as possible.

253
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,508
At the earliest.

254
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,800
Find someone for Roshni.

255
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,680
I know a match for Mehek.

256
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,468
I can get all the phones in the world now...

257
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:06,261
I've been so relieved today that you're gonna be free...

258
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,500
And now...

259
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,041
I've troubled myself by thinking...

260
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,691
How?

261
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:50,530
Who'd be here with me after you're gone?

262
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:57,460
Just these walls, I'm sure... I'll celebrate your freedom with them...

263
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,440
But... These walls will never say a word...

264
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:12,011
My loneliness will remind me of being here...

265
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,510
But your happiness matters more...

266
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,408
No...

267
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,721
You don't see it, but you're getting out with me.

268
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,810
Don't be silly...

269
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:40,263
Don't think or do anything that doesn't get you closer to your wife.

270
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:45,800
I ain't so fortunate...

271
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:52,728
You'd lose your battle if you chose to help me...

272
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:56,480
And you're not supposed to lose this...

273
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
You're not...

274
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,969
Supposed to lose...

275
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,328
Surely, not this one...

276
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,250
Please, Saqib...

277
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,378
Please talk to me...

278
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,579
Adam!

279
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,400
Adam... My...

280
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,618
My son...

281
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:51,790
Please save my son...

282
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,084
Please...

283
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,620
Adam...

284
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,860
Here so late?

285
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,101
Everything alright?

286
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:51,552
Grandp -- Mr Malik wants to see you.

287
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,688
Right now?
-Yes.

288
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:01,850
Go. I'll be there in a minute.
-He asked me to bring you along.

289
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,608
Right now?

290
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,860
Okay.

291
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,709
This number is switched --

292
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,990
Why d'you want to waste them?

293
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,950
Wipe your tears.

294
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,496
You don't know how invaluable a woman's tears can be.

295
00:33:45,496 --> 00:33:50,510
A few drops have toppled kings and emperors...

296
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:56,610
You have no idea what a woman's tears can do to the mother who's raised her son...

297
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,520
Hmm...

298
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,651
It takes just one drop to make brothers mortal enemies.

299
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,850
Yet here you are...

300
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:12,330
Wasting the force that can drive the world for nothing!

301
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,048
What are you saying?

302
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,330
I know he was here to see <i>you</i>.

303
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:30,948
I can see the fear that he may betray you in your eyes... This restlessness tells me everything...

304
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:37,699
But let me tell you. Those who put their lives on the line to vault walls never betray.

305
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,311
I'm with you.

306
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,151
I'll help you.

307
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,758
Don't cry.

308
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Good girl.

309
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,231
Roshni!

310
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,870
Listen to me...

311
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,241
I'm here with you.

312
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,092
I won't let you two be the next Romeo and Juliet.

313
00:35:12,092 --> 00:35:16,270
Just... Don't believe anything your Mam tells you, okay?

314
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,680
Go.

315
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,281
Go!

316
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,969
Go!

317
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:36,321
Sweet Iesu! It'll be proper good fun if your daughter ripped through your veil of honour!

318
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:40,652
What's with the 'if', though, Guddi? Pray that it happens!

319
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,511
You wanted to see me, Mr Malik?

320
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,721
Bless you.

321
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:56,602
Everything alright? I mean... You called me at this hour...

322
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,051
Do I have any right over you, Adam?

323
00:36:02,051 --> 00:36:04,131
'Any' right?

324
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,409
You have every right over me, Mr Malik.

325
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:11,471
Your wish is my command.

326
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:20,630
I don't have the courage to hear you turn me down...

327
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:27,930
So... Should I ask for it?

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:31,771
I hold you in the highest regard, Mr Malik.

329
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:39,051

00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:43,139
Well, then... I say...

331
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,630
Marry my Mehek.
