1
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,559
How d'you feel?

2
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,347
Where's Adam?

3
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:42,540
Ma'am?

4
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,189
The man with me.

5
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:51,392
He said he had something to do. You're fine now. You're on glucose until the evening. Then, you can go home.

6
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,128
Could I use your phone? Got to call someone...
-Okay.

7
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:58,907
Thank you.

8
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,840
Malik Jr!

9
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,611
Where's he?

10
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,038
Enough, Mehek...

11
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:17,969
Enough...

12
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,050
Adam won't 'yes' you this time. Where's Malik Jr?

13
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,189
You bloody dog!
-Dad!
-Adam! No!

14
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,471
You vile, rotten, disgraceful animal!

15
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:11,731
You vile, rotten, disgraceful animal!
-I'll get Grandpa...
-Dad!
-Adam!

16
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,121
I'll get Grandpa...
-Dad!
-Adam!

17
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,430
I'll kill you!

18
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,579
Mr Adam!
-Adam!
-Leave him!
-It's okay, Mr Adam!

19
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:33,269
We'll take it from here. He's a murderer. He'll be punished by the law. Arrest him!

20
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,250
Thought you could get away so easily?

21
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:44,880
I knew something was off when you asked me to get off the car. I followed you...

22
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,350
I want to thank you with a hug, Doctor... You've been kind.

23
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,310
Most welcome, Mr Malik... You are <i>most</i> welcome...

24
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,958
I recorded you murdering Dr Rana on my phone...

25
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,480
And gave it to the police.

26
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,868
May you rot behind the bars for the rest of your life...

27
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,570
Take him away!

28
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,490
We're done here!

29
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,100
Adam...

30
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,780
Grandpa's not good... Can't breathe... Hurry up!
-Grandpa...

31
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,098
Grandpa...
-Grandpa!

32
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,170
Grandpa...

33
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,210
Requiescat...

34
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,809
No...

35
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:40,869
No...
-...In pace...

36
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,580
Grandpa!
-Grandpa...

37
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,491
No...
-No! Grandpa...

38
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,440
Grandpa! No!

39
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,251
But -- Grandpa...

40
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,327
Huh?

41
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,937
Grandpa...

42
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,400
Grandpa!

43
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,778
No...

44
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,777
Grandpa...

45
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,798
Grandpa...

46
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,998
I'll arrange the funeral...

47
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,138
Grandpa...

48
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,440
Grandpa...

49
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,510
I've told you everything, Mam...

50
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm tired of running away...

51
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,730
I can't go on any more...

52
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:16,460
Don't know what else fate has in store for me...

53
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,970
But it sure ain't happiness...
-No, love...

54
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,010
A daughter struggling day and night...

55
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,618
To make ends meet...

56
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:33,388
Gives her mother sleepless nights...

57
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,159
I kept you away from myself...

58
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,469
To save your Tad from disgrace...

59
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,520
But, in truth...

60
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
What'd we have to lose?

61
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,560
Mam...

62
00:08:55,961 --> 00:08:59,900
I'm tired of this...

63
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:05,682
My hands and legs grow weary... My heart rusts...

64
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,740
Na, Mam... All I want right now...

65
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,450
Is to lay my head in your lap...

66
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,278
Nothing else...

67
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,610
It's okay...

68
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,850
Your crimes aren't too great...

69
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:28,701
Swindling the moneylender to save your dying Tad...

70
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,981
Any loving daughter would've done the same...

71
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:37,281
That's where it started, innit?

72
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,420
I wish...

73
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,478
I so wish...

74
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:52,248
I hadn't thrown you out... But I feared the cops...

75
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:56,748
I wish I'd saved you from this long and thorny journey...

76
00:09:56,748 --> 00:10:00,318
Everything you did ever since...

77
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,090
Was to help us get by...

78
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,697
Make ends meet...

79
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:11,066
I wish I weren't scared of the cops...

80
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,380
But...

81
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,930
When a man...

82
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,550
Threatens...

83
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,460
A poor, ageing mother...

84
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,518
Because of her young daughter...

85
00:10:31,518 --> 00:10:34,909
It is... Frightening, to say the least...

86
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,780
I was wrong...

87
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,290
I lost to my fear...

88
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,837
Just -- Forget everything and -- Come back...

89
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,570
Your home...

90
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,608
Your Mam's lap...

91
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:54,348
Await you...

92
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,548
Come back...

93
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:59,670
The funeral's done... I've got something to do... Take care of everything here, okay? See you...
-Adam! Wait!

94
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,038
Yeah?

95
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:08,728
E -- Everyone's asking about Guddi... Mehek's so worried too...

96
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,527
Tell her she's fine.

97
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,047
Don't worry.

98
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,987
Okay...

99
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,750
Don't touch me...

100
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,410
Go...

101
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,550
Uh...

102
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,040
It's you, innit?

103
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,328
Ydw. Me.

104
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,027
I'm sorry I was so rude the other day.

105
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:12,330
I've got grandchildren your age, girl...

106
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,748
Aye...

107
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:16,310
They do that too, sometimes...

108
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,260
Kids these days...

109
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,070
Could you help me, sir?

110
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,430
I want to go home to my Mam...

111
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,683
But...

112
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,540
I haven't got any money...

113
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,650
I promise you I'll pay you back...

114
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,970
You need...

115
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,380
Hmm...

116
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,070
Money... Well...

117
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,400
Where's the patient?
-Just left.

118
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,401
But where?

119
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:07,120
I don't know. I was in the other room. She was gone when I came back.

120
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,040
In her state -- How could y --

121
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,400
Where'd you have to go in this condition, Guddi?

122
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,097
Guddi!

123
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,778
Hello?

124
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:50,570
Yeah, Munna... Is she home? Guddi.

125
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,867
No...?

126
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,577

Guts haggard... Sweating... Worried...

Yet as innocent as always...

Go!

This humble porter prays...

That you find yourself...

And your long wait END AT LAST...!

146
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,767
Hey!

147
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:51,479
The number three's here! C'mon!

148
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:53,972
Everyone here!

149
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,159
Leaving?

150
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,437
Ie.

151
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,021
Leaving me?

152
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,880
Ie...

153
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,338
Why?

154
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,588
No idea...

155
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,898
Well, then...

156
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Why don't you think again, mate?

157
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,188
Why?

158
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,400
Just spoke my heart out...

159
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,040
Stop lying...

160
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,310
I don't know how to lie...

161
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:03,842
I swear... I mean it...

162
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,138
Why d'you want me to stay?

163
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,778
Well... There's two reasons...

164
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,520
I want to hear them right now.

165
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,370
For one...

166
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,461
I'd have to go all the way with a proposal, mate...

167
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,976
And?

168
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,720
And...

169
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,890
I can't live without you...

170
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,140
I swear.

171
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,368
By the Lord...

172
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,800
I can't...

173
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,480
Okay.

174
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,677
I'm staying here...

175
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,970
But what do I tell Mam? I said I'm coming.

176
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,961
Well...

177
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,838
Call her...

178
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,097
Tell her you're coming... In two days?

179
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:37,968
Yeah.

180
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,628
Two days.
-Yeah.

Good day...

Good day to you too... You'll get your money in a couple of days...

199
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:03,440
It's okay. Just wanted to tell you I don't want to continue my claim. Guddi's like my sister... She can come here anytime.

200
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,339
Thank you so much.

201
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:12,670
It's nothing. Take care.

202
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,958
Take care...

203
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,090
Who is it? Dyw, I'm comin'!

204
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,960
Can't wait a second...

205
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,838
Mam...

206
00:23:07,748 --> 00:23:09,710
Guddi...

207
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,788
Guddi!

208
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,430
I've missed you so much...

209
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,451
It's okay, Mam... I'm here now... I'm not going anywhere...

210
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:41,101
Come...

211
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,117
What happened to your strength,

212
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:19,368
Your pride,

213
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:22,287
Your conceit...

214
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:24,307
Your ego?

215
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,778
Ehh?

216
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,719
I asked something...

217
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,618
You don't know...

218
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,408
But I do...

219
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:46,449
Their stiff corpses rot in a morgue...

220
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,350
How'd you like a cuppa, Mr Khan?

221
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:17,038
Come in... In the Lord's name...

222
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,168
How are you?

223
00:27:23,168 --> 00:27:25,750
Hello.
-Come.
-Sit.

224
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,941
Please, take a seat...
-After you.

225
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,410
I can't believe you're here.

226
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,860
How couldn't we?

227
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:55,250
I don't know how I could be of service to someone your stature...

228
00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:00,920
We're just here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage...

229
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,239
Uhh...

230
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:12,370
Got to take this call...

231
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,280
Excuse me...

232
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,510
Just shy as always!

233
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,178
What are you doing here?

234
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:28,359
Just couldn't resist...

235
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,390
That...

236
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,131
Magnetic look...

237
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:34,600
Whoa...

238
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,081
Never thought a man so serious could be so romantic.

239
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,811
Get used to it.

240
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:48,224
There's a lot more in store for Mrs Adam!

241
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,030
What've we here?

242
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,560
Well -- I --

243
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,178
Call --

244
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:14,020
Calm down, Aliya... Mum will be back... Easy...

245
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,160
She'll be back soon.

246
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,880
We've found Zulaikha.

247
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,610
Where's Mum?

248
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,648
Karachi...

249
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,929
At a refuge...

250
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,350
Refuge?

251
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,167
Yeah.

252
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,768
Good Lord... I'm knackered...

253
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:55,458
My legs are aching so bad...

254
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,589
Guddi... Make sure we've got everything we need, okay?

255
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:07,769
I'll have a look too... Dyw... I'm positively knackered...

256
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:17,958
I gotta take this one!
-Forget it for a change! You're always on your phone! Just -- Listen to me... Guddi!

257
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,480
Yeah?

258
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,870
Ie?

259
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,580
Ain't that what <i>I</i> always say?

260
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,720
Order me.

261
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,811
All your life.

262
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:40,060
Won't you ask me why I've called you?
-You don't ask why when your prayers get heard. You just say 'Amen'.

263
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,801
I'll tell you then...

264
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:52,080
I was trying my wedding suit on... Everyone said it's lovely so I thought I'd give you the good news...

265
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,110
Your voice is all the good news I need.

266
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,710
Guddi!

267
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,130
Did you talk to the Reverend about your marriage?
-I'm coming, Mam...

268
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,870
Gotta hang up now...

269
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,639
Okay...

270
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,180
Nope. You do it.
-No, you. I won't.

271
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:16,380
Don't even start. You can't beat me at my own game.

272
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,018
Okay, bye...

273
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,078
Ie, Mam?

274
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:29,230
Talk to the Reverend... You can have a chat later!
-That's all?

275
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,308
Grist, Mam...
-Mam...

276
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:13,870
Are you prepared, as you follow the path of Marriage, to love and honour each other for as long as you both shall live?

277
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,320
Of course.

278
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,918
With all my heart!

279
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:21,278
Here. Sign this.

280
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,610
Deo gratias...

281
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
