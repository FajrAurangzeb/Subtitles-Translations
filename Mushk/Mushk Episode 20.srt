1
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,547
I'll get going then...

2
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,620
You haven't had anything all day. Should I get you something?
-Thanks...

3
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,710
But I don't need it...
-Don't you care too much about needs?

4
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,567
Why not?
-Oh I won't dare...

5
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:19,772
I won't dare say a word about needing anything...

6
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:24,011
I'm here because I've learnt to respect needs...

7
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,124
I'd like to say sorry...

8
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,656
To you... To myself...

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm so sorry I always misunderstood...
-No, Adam...

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,638
I swear...

11
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,461
You've earned a place in my heart.

12
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:55,220
The times may've done what they've done to my mind...

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,120
But my heart is crystal clear...

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,985
I'd hate to be the reason you're grieved or embarrassed.

15
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:07,300
I pray to get a chance...

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,935
To give you the happiness you deserve.

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,620
You're back! And Shahmir!

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:35,476
How're you, boyo? Guess what? I'd prayed that you come back quickly so I can play with you again!

19
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,378
You'd prayed?

20
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:41,163
Yeah.

21
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,808
Upstairs?

22
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,134
That's my story.

23
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:06,070
I didn't tell you my story to earn a place in your heart...

24
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,060
You asked... I answered...

25
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,983
Stories don't earn a place in our hearts, Guddi.

26
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:17,650
Surely not in a heart like mine.

27
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,968
But I will say this...

28
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:22,638
You have my respects.

29
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,142
<i>Just</i> respect?

30
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:29,064
Not a place in your heart?

31
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:38,520
Respect from the bottom of my heart...
-Well then, how say you respect what my heart wants?

32
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,890
Haven't felt like cooking something in ages.

33
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,940
Please, have it...

34
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,055
I'd be delighted.

35
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,060
Send it with Munna.

36
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,868
Nah...

37
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:54,030
This is too easy...

38
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,930
Too unfair...

39
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,747
For everything I've suffered!

40
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,178
I'll make you suffer...

41
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,560
I won't say much... Nor ask you to stop crying...

42
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,250
Nor give you anything close to a false hope...

43
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,384
Cry all you want...

44
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:42,090
Over your misfortune... For your kid... Cry buckets!

45
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,638
But for God's sake, don't shed a tear for that blimmin' two-timer!

46
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,210
Betrayal craves tears.

47
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,565
It thrives on tears.

48
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:58,198
Get it?

49
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,978
Zafar!

50
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,984
You're -- Here -- Sir? How -- ?

51
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,703
Servants are paid to answer...

52
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:46,753
Questioning doesn't suit their poor selves...

53
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,957
Yet you asked two...

54
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:56,494
That's all the questions you'll ever ask in your life.

55
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,120
Before you dare ask another...

56
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,590
Remember that I don't need to ask anyone before kicking you out.

57
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,970
Forgive me, sir...

58
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,290
I wouldn't have said any of this if I hadn't already...

59
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:23,458
You know just as well that my hands know how to - and would love to - do the talking.

60
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,825
Get my car out.

61
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,416
Sir.

62
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,631
Come in.

63
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,521
Sit...

64
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,477
Not here to sit.
-Why?

65
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,328
Make yourself at home.

66
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,053
Oh...

67
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,723
I get it...

68
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,946
Coming into your daughter's room at this hour on her wedding night...

69
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:12,917
The embarrassment holds your feet...

70
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,080
You said something to her.

71
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,200
Aye...

72
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,292
She said she's scared.

73
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:30,967
I said it's okay. I'm right here.

74
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,530
But she's just a little girl...

75
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,630
What does she know about marriage...

76
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,650
Or her husband protecting her?

77
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,660
All she knows...

78
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,943
Is her Mum's lap...

79
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:51,550
And her Dad's chest...

80
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,650
So, I said...

81
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,378
'Go'...

82
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,652
You having a laugh?
-No.

83
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,360
I pity you.

84
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:11,910
I promise you, Mr Khan...

85
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,250
This is only the beginning...

86
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,490
You weren't there for me in my grief...

87
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,074
But I'll be right by your side in yours...

88
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,217
I'm honestly knackered. If you could just?

89
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,968
Take her to her room.

90
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,912
Get up. C'mon.

91
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,888
Come.

92
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,680
Mehek...

93
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,500
Me --

94
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,339
Mehek...

95
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:04,751
Shahmir's been crying for ages... I've heard him for five minutes! I thought you'd be calming him... But you look distressed yourself...

96
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,689
Mehek?

97
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,688
Why?

98
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,236
Hmm...

99
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:21,156
He's just a kid... How can he tell you?

100
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:27,608
Probably hungry... Or having a headache... Or just couldn't sleep?

101
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,560
Give him here and go...

102
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,042
Okay.

103
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,735
Shahmir!

104
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:41,336
Easy there, mate...

105
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,460
Here.

106
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,400
Mind if I asked something?

107
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,008
No.

108
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,667
Sure?

109
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,326
Not now...

110
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:05,405
I won't mind any bit of hope or comfort...

111
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:11,440
But if anyone were to pray for me... I'd shut him up.

112
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,135
What are you saying?

113
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,430
Nothing...

114
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,057
You wanted to ask something...

115
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,682
What is it?

116
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:34,320
Well... I've never seen my Dad...

117
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,489
Mum said the Lord God called him for something important...

118
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:47,580
And when she was gone, everyone else said she'd gone to see Dad...

119
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,970
I believed it back then...

120
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,596
But I could only believe it for so long before I realised I'm orphaned...

121
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,474
Don't say that, Munna...

122
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,480
No -- I'm not grieving or something...

123
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,280
I just wanted to ask...

124
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:15,500
If it's the same with Shahmir... Has he never seen his Dad too?

125
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,400
Never had a ride on his Dad's shoulders? Like all the other kids...

126
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:29,910
Or felt a tear of happiness fall on him as his Dad picked him up for the first time?

127
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:37,307
Or touched his Dad's face with his little hands?

128
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,777
Was it something I said?

129
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,134
No.

130
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,578
Not at all.

131
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:58,915
Everything you said was... Touching... Pure...

132
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:03,458
But it's never happened...

133
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:09,208
Shahmir's Dad never even picked him up?

134
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,288
But why?

135
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,004
Let's just say...

136
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:24,354
His Dad's with your parents now... For me, at least...

137
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:57,720
Munna! Don't go to bed just yet. Dinner's almost ready. You're coming with me to Adam's.

138
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,047
Couldn't he get anything for himself?

139
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,619
No questions.

140
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:07,088
Just do as I say.

141
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,918
You were crying?

142
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,133
N -- No?

143
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,071
Okay.

144
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:19,677
Sit.

145
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,023
Come here...

146
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,827
Little lies less than the eyes...

147
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,078
So... What happened?

148
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,910
Your eyes are doing their favourite thing.

149
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,890
Telling the truth.

150
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,970
Nothing, really... Don't say anything...

151
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,568
Do I look that dangerous?

152
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:52,558
That's what they all think, innit?

153
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:57,513
That Guddi doesn't know empathy... Kindness... Love?

154
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:59,003
Innit?

155
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,646
May I speak freely?
-Please.

156
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:07,536
That 'innit' says everything. That's how everyone thinks...

157
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,925
There was a time when I could sense pain a hundred miles away...

158
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:22,700
And whenever I did, I'd run towards it...

159
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,140
I didn't care who was suffering...

160
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:39,570
But only... How much I could ease him...

161
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,913
Until... It started weighing on my chest...

162
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:46,100
And gradually...

163
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,234
Suffocating me...

164
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,909
As I breathed my last...

165
00:17:53,909 --> 00:18:00,720
I looked all around...

166
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,190
But there was no one to ease <i>my</i> pain...

167
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,528
Much less make me forget it.

168
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,404
And...

169
00:18:14,404 --> 00:18:17,620
That's when Guddi got angry!

170
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,994
In her fury, she grabbed her empathy by the throat...

171
00:18:21,994 --> 00:18:26,960
And throttled it until it begged to be forgiven...

172
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,527
Did you forgive it?

173
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:35,250
As for kindness... And love... Let's just say...

174
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,570
They died the same day...

175
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,860
God forgive --
-Don't.

176
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,090
Just pray...

177
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,280
That he never live a moment without thinking of me...

178
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,943
Just like I never stop thinking of him...

179
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,887
Who?

180
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,344
You know...

181
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,348
Who?

182
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,616
You know...

183
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,915
Our very own...

184
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,095
Iesu... Who is it this late? Could you go check?

185
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,355
Hello?

186
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,893
Hylo!

187
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,859
What is it?

188
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,077
Don't pretend like my 'hello' was nothing!

189
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:46,065
I mean -- Go on...

190
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:50,271
Don't turn in yet... Dinner's almost ready.

191
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:53,090
I won't claim you'd be delighted to taste it...

192
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,709
Just that I was delighted to cook!

193
00:19:56,709 --> 00:19:58,706
Well, then...

194
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:01,433
I'll be delighted to try it!

195
00:20:02,894 --> 00:20:04,175
Okay.

196
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,648
'Evening...

197
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:14,453
Why'd you lie to me?
-What?

198
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:17,580
You said they'd be back in two days!

199
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:24,320
I told you what they told me... What's my fault if they came back early?

200
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,386
Where's Guddi?

201
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:27,690
Why?

202
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,960
Don't bug me with another question and tell me... Where is she?

203
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,957
By the kitchen...

204
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,988
Hey...

205
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,073
Why's your phone off?

206
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:54,019
You didn't even tell me you're going!

207
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,560
Didn't think what I'd think...

208
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,433
Didn't think how restless I'd be if I didn't hear your voice... Or see you...

209
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,253
You're angry?

210
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,270
Was it something I did?

211
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,605
Munna... Tell him to get out of my way...
-Sir?

212
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:21,225
Didn't say a word!

213
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,269
Didn't even greet me back...

214
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,486
Ie, right...

215
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,322
You got a point.

216
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:32,850
Not greeting someone back's sinful. I'd rather stay away from it.

217
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:37,875
So, have a good night... But just one good night. Bye.

218
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,492
Munna... Show him <i>all</i> the way out, will you?

219
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,904
C'mon, sir... I'll show you <i>all</i> the way out...

220
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,700
Love the aroma.
-Made with love!

221
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,584
Just a sec... I'll let Grandpa know where we're going...
-Not so fast!

222
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,804
You lost it?

223
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:00,930
Why?

224
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,030
Don't you think we should ask him before leaving?

225
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:13,460
I'm older than you. Don't you think you should be doing as I say?

226
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,760
Of course.
-Innit? Then get a move on!

227
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,498
C'mon!

228
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,110
Loathe yourself yet?

229
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,973
So weak you couldn't even face yourself...

230
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm not weak!

231
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,530
I ought to loathe you...

232
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,401
As your conscience, I ought to loathe you!

233
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:26,864
And I do!

234
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,444
You.

235
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:30,594
You. Are.

236
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,547
You. Are. Weak!

237
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:40,532
You think only Asher Khan's got the right to take lives.

238
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,270
You forgot about the Lord...

239
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,302
I didn't! It's Him I fear!

240
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:55,779
So you, already married to a woman, got married to that girl because you feared Him!

241
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,610
Why didn't your soul tremble at the thought?

242
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,948
Don't even think of tricking me. I'm as old as you...
-Okay, I'm weak!

243
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:09,901
I'm weak before my sister's tears... Not weak to face death!

244
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:14,018
I'm weak before her kids' fate!

245
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,298
I'm weak...

246
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:23,300
Oh, I get it now... You're worried about their fate...

247
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,067
What about the fate you've condemned Mehek to?

248
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,346
Hey!

249
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,645
Double time!

250
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,954
Quickly, Munna! Give it to me!

251
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,010
Come in.

252
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,080
You?

253
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,152
Why?

254
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:32,202
Why can't I come knocking here myself?

255
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:37,967
That's not what I meant... Not at all...

256
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:44,560
Oh? I wonder what that 'you' meant then... Mind telling me?

257
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,420
It's late, Guddi -- I told you -- Just send Munna...

258
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:56,458
So -- I was just -- Surprised to see you...

259
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,468
That's all...

260
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,790
Want me to leave?

261
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,383
You're my guest.

262
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,885
I wouldn't dare say that.

263
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,497
But I would say... They're all here... My family...

264
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:24,798
What'd they think if they saw you?

265
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,767
Thinking... That's the problem!

266
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,350
Here. Walk right behind us.

267
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,973
C'mon.

268
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,943
C'mon already!
-What? Where?

269
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,185
Quickly!
-Guddi!

270
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,866
Where are you ta --

271
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:50,460
You'll find out!
-Where are we going?

272
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,103
No one around here.

273
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,940
Get your thoughts in bed. It's too late.

274
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,040
What's with the smile?

275
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,689
Everytime you'd say something, I'd be furious...

276
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:20,480
But now...

277
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,282
I feel like smiling...

278
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,667
But if you don't like it...

279
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:29,304
I might as well not.

280
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:32,983
To like...

281
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:35,011
And your smile...

282
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:40,096
Grist, they sound one and the same. Synonymous, as they'd say in school.

283
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:42,340
May I?

284
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,284
Yeah?

285
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,875
I feel like smiling again. May I?

286
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,810
What are you waiting for? I'd be delighted.

287
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,457
'Synonymous'!

288
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:01,365
Aye...

289
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,715
Orders?

290
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,247
Oops...

291
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:08,350
I almost forgot you're here! What was I saying?

292
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,640
Sorry I didn't hear you?

293
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,010
Go.

294
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,090
How'd you come back?

295
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,890
You couldn't drop me, could you?
-Hmm?

296
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,440
Drop me home?

297
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,730
Anytime.

298
00:29:22,907 --> 00:29:27,270
Quickly. It's a bit urgent!
-Go! Give it here!

299
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,610
Here.

300
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,633
Thank you.

301
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,540
Wasted my life...

302
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,010
And...

303
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,508
Ruined it...

304
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:05,199
I'd laugh when one of my toys broke...

305
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:10,028
I'd laugh when Mum and Dad beat me...

306
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:15,240
I always felt like smiling when someone tried to break my young heart...

307
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,523
Never cried for a moment...

308
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:26,630
Always covered my eyes and faked it at funerals...

309
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,252
Always got by without shedding a tear...

310
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:35,155
I've seen many eyes cry... Made them, too...

311
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:41,010
But it's the first time I've seen my own moisten...

312
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,927
Just pray it doesn't go on like this...

313
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,770
Because the more the tears...

314
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,560
The more the bloodshed...

315
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:37,644
I hope I'm not forcing myself on you.
-Of course not...

316
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,620
Just... Haven't seen you this way before...

317
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,130
Everything you say...

318
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,434
Every word is redolent with pain...

319
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,723
I fear forcing myself...

320
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,037
Life's forced itself on me for too long... Almost always...

321
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:10,982
This is the first thing I'm doing because I want to. For you.

322
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,222
A bitter childhood, Guddi...

323
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:26,163
Makes one's inner child cower behind his heart...

324
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,532
And, dare I say, your inner child is so... Innocent...

325
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:36,694
May the Lord bless it with a long life.

326
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,802
Feeling cold?

327
00:32:53,390 --> 00:33:00,953
Yeah... But not because I want you to play my knight and give me your coat!

328
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,740
Oh, I don't have to be a knight to do that...

329
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,823
Just... Human.

330
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,640
What about you?

331
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,753
I'll build a fire.

332
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,998
Oh, just don't...

333
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,000
Why d'you want to go just yet?

334
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,237
The young Mr Malik can be a very nice man!

335
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,019
And these flowers...

336
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,064
Just... Lovely...

337
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,485
So lovely...

338
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,244
Okay now?

339
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,601
You forgot something.

340
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:42,230
Yeah?

341
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,394
I made something specially for you, but you haven't even tried it!

342
00:34:48,394 --> 00:34:50,250
Ah, yes...

343
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:57,205
I'm sorry... I just -- Got too -- Busy talking... Forgot it...

344
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:59,270
Shall we?

345
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,958
After you.

346
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,425
Mind if I make a wish?

347
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:13,905
No?

348
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,286
I'm sure you would...

349
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:22,054
But I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't.

350
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:24,338
Go on.

351
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,660
Mind if I feed you your first?

352
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,750
Guddi...

353
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,180
I don't mind it, but...

354
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,215
You know...

355
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,630
Okay.

356
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,370
In the Lord's name...

357
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,690
Have something.

358
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,466
Here.

359
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,113
Lovely.

360
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,839
Everything.

361
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
