1
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,427
Don't wipe those tears.

2
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:42,170
After what she's done, it's best that you let it all out.

3
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,833
A father's tears prove that he hasn't lost his honour after his daughter...

4
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,992
I cried a lot too... All night... Know why?

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:01:02,506
I thought of you. A father who'd want nothing but to search the world for his daughter, but can't even stand on his own two feet...

6
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,838
I wish I could do something for you...

7
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:07,432
Lemme rub your feet...
-No...

8
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:14,996
Please don't stop me... Let me do whatever I can... I can't just sit back and relax...

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey, Aunt... Meet Roshni.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,879
Hello... Bless you. Bless you two.

11
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:45,829
You have a way with words, Saqib... But got to say... No words could ever capture her brilliance!

12
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,970
No words can describe your English rose...
-Come in.
-Come, my dear...

13
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,127
God bless you. Come in.

14
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,726
Ever trusted someone without reason?

15
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,328
But look where you ended up...

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,848
What's this got to do with trust?

17
00:02:12,848 --> 00:02:16,277
Oh, everything...

18
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,972
What do you mean?

19
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:28,336
Just a fever. A puny fever. That's all it took to get you in this state.

20
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:33,000
A bit fishy, don't you think?

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,954
I could never think of anything but getting better...

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:49,060
I swear you've been brought to this state... And I swear you will be fine...

23
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,593
You're kidding.

24
00:02:53,664 --> 00:03:02,253
I feel for you. You've got a special place in my heart. Just... Don't ask why.

25
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:09,039
Don't tell anyone what I said if you want to get well soon!

26
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,417
Guddi!

27
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,351
Guddi!
-Ie, what?

28
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:17,710
Your son's crying.
-Noted. Go.

29
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,637
You're only taking the pills <i>I</i> give you.

30
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,577
O Lord...

31
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:17,339
Save me from this trial, or at least remind me of the sin you're punishing me for, so I can know what I've done to deserve this...

32
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,520
Hey, Rida...

33
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,364
Hey...

34
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,519
Why are you crying? There, now...

35
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,193
Bless her. Ain't she lovely?

36
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:58,833
Wait here, I'll get something for you.

37
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:01,739
I'll get going...

38
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,664
Where?

39
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:10,458
Get the Reverend here, and some friends, you know? Witnesses, remember?

40
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,573
I'd rather we get married today.

41
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,621
Yeah. I'll make ready. I'll leave you to yourselves, then.

42
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:41,230
If a two-timer asked me to tell him what true love means, I'll tell him about you. Nothing else could come close.

43
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:48,537
In the age of digital love, what you've done for me happens only in dreams...

44
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,929
I'll get going, then...

45
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:57,769
Got to make ready to make this dream a reality.

46
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,871
Please don't leave...

47
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:01,939
Why?

48
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,290
Aren't you eager to become Roshni Saqib?

49
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,448
Eager? I'm dying to see the moment.

50
00:06:11,448 --> 00:06:20,533
I'll open my eyes to all the happiness in the world after I've said 'I do'.

51
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,712
But... I don't know why... When you talk about going... I feel like stopping you...

52
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:45,938
Don't go anywhere... My fear as I took the first step out of the house was nothing before this fear...

53
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,430
Do you see how worried I am?

54
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,140
It's okay.

55
00:06:50,140 --> 00:07:01,790
Sorrows don't like it when you start heading towards happiness... They'd rather engulf you... Stop you in your tracks...

56
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:10,166
But only those who take these heavy steps make it through this trial.

57
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,632
I'll get going.

58
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,295
I'll be back.

59
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,353
Any word?

60
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:55,973
Qutbuddin got to the man he lived with... Put the screws on him.

61
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,560
I don't think he could get anything.

62
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,516
But yeah, Saqib's got family in Karachi.

63
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,028
Grandpa will die if she didn't...

64
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:07,259
Please, Adam... Do something...

65
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,036
Mehek...

66
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:13,110
Your sobs destroy my spirit...

67
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,855
Don't worry.

68
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:18,935
Strength, Mehek... I'm heading for Karachi.

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,193
Yeah?

70
00:08:33,193 --> 00:08:34,990
May I ask something?

71
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,714
Why not?

72
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:41,501
Have you really found Shayan?

73
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,970
Yeah.

74
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,741
How's he?

75
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,563
No idea.

76
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,307
But I know where he is.

77
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,554
I can get him first if you want.

78
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,085
No...

79
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:03,712
Grandpa's life matters the most to me right now.

80
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:08,500
Do what you must... Get Roshni back.

81
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,864
May the Lord will thus...

82
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,040
Guess what? They've found Daddy...

83
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,063
Just pray he comes back soon.

84
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,985
Come here...

85
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,078
This number cannot accept calls at the moment. Please --

86
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:32,491
Just in from the back gate... A few steps in... I'll be waiting!

87
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,880
I've been asking Roshni's friends...

88
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,569
Trying to find out where she is without giving much away...

89
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:45,523
Let's hope I find something...

90
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,876
Psst!

91
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,995
Psst!

92
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,474
Why d'you men always conflate smiles with consent?

93
00:11:29,474 --> 00:11:31,690
No -- I -- Just --

94
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,444
Ie, you just what?

95
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:45,796
70% of the women here have to struggle to suppress their smiles at the best of times because 100% of the men read consent into them!

96
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

97
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,051
Hmm... If you're so sorry... It's okay...

98
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,933
Thank you.

99
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,127
Take my hand.

100
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:00,067
Uh?

101
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,820
C'mon!

102
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,618
Now let go.

103
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,355
Boundaries.

104
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,759
Learn to respect them and you will earn your forgiveness.

105
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,377
Would you like some water?
-W -- Water?

106
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:17,183
Ah, yes...

107
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:19,994
Please, come in. I'll get you some...

108
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,830
I'd like it... Cold...

109
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,840
Sure.

110
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,863
After you!

111
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,973
How you doin', mate?

112
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:07,200
Fine. You?
-Just...

113
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,880
Fit as a fiddle...

114
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,270
Which, for someone my age, means...

115
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:21,685
Putting up well enough!

116
00:13:22,097 --> 00:13:26,470
But when the bones start hurting...

117
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,706
Sometimes, we just...

118
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:36,250
Gotta say that we're gettin' old...

119
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,640
Where are you off to?

120
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm looking for someone.

121
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,838
Who?

122
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:50,050
Someone's honour.

123
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,430
Who got away, not aware how dear she is.

124
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,760
Whose honour are you talking about? I don't get it.

125
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,858
Just... High society things...

126
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:05,828
Seen her anywhere?

127
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,348
Well...

128
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,752
I dunno...

129
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:16,613
Know what...

130
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:19,595
I think it's gonna rain...

131
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,808
I gotta go prepare my lunch...

132
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,844
Why are you getting worried?

133
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,282
Had anything?

134
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,862
Call him, will you?

135
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,620
This number is switched off.

136
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,680
But why?

137
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,937
Cor blimey...

138
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:24,120
It's not like he's left you forever...

139
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,124
God forbid!

140
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,564
Sir!

141
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,859
Sir!

142
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,553
Aye?

143
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,389
Well...

144
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:34,419
I can see it in your eyes.

145
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,606
I can see you're hiding something.

146
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,402
Please, sir...

147
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,590
For the love of God...

148
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:52,050
For the sake of an honourable family... I beg you...

149
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,480
Tell me whatever it is that you know.

150
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,815
It -- It's time -- f -- for my prayers... I'll talk to you in a sec...

151
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,556
Dreadful...

152
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:16,970
But there's just one silver lining that shines brighter than everything.

153
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,614
No one outside the family has the foggiest.

154
00:17:22,614 --> 00:17:26,072
My men are looking for them in Karachi.

155
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:31,940
I will not say 'Don't worry'... Empty words can only do so much...

156
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,092
But trust me, I'll find her.

157
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:54,053
I'll be back... Mr Malik missed his pills yesterday. I don't want it happening again.

158
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,010
Gone a bridge too far, haven't you?
-Ehh?

159
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,065
I don't get it...

160
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:30,340
We passed the door to Mr Malik's room and you didn't even notice... Not your fault, though... No one ever got his eyes off me after I was all grown-up! You just missed a door... They've all missed <i>so</i> much more... Want me to take you there?

161
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,507
Blimey, that's two marvels in one...

162
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:42,319
A charming personality topped by a lovely voice, etching the melodies of heaven with every gilded syllable...

163
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,820
Mind if I say thank you?

164
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,195
Of course not.
-Thank you so much...

165
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:50,371
I can see my dream in your eyes, by the way...

166
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,419
Whoa... Really?

167
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,950
Yeah... That one sinful dream... Always wanted to become a doctor...

168
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,767
What stopped you?

169
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:06,674
Let's just say I couldn't come to terms with the fees...

170
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,331
How say we fix that?

171
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,070
How?

172
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,165
I can call you Dr Guddi if that's what you like.

173
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,330
Lovely...

174
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,650
So...
-Yeah?

175
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,060
Would you mind if I take over and give Mr Malik his pills every day?

176
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,073
That's all?

177
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,170
Of course.

178
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,660
Fine by me... With all my heart...
-Great. Come with me.

179
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,426
Great. Come with me.
-After you.

180
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:33,967
Put it down!
-I won't!

181
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:37,140
Give me my phone!
-Delete it right now!

182
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,890
Delete his number!
-You better watch yourself!

183
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:48,100
Delete his number and don't you dare call or text him again! I'll kill you!

184
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,840
Holy Mary... Her Majesty at her coldest and wildest!

185
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,650
Weren't you ashamed of yourself when you gave the estate agent your number in broad daylight?

186
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:04,668
You stole his number, didn't you? From this 'ere dog?

187
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:18,090
God forgive you... You blimmin' hag! He blocked Rosy... Stopped taking my calls... Mind sharing your secret spell?

188
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:26,610
Oh, I know you inside out... You live on his money, eh? He topped it up for you... How much has he squandered on you by now?

189
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,700
Oh, please...

190
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:41,740
I need the money, Rosy... He's ready to give me some... I've got to pay my brother's fees... Please don't do anything...

191
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,067
Oh, can it!

192
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:49,514
And <i>you</i>! Bet you heard everything, yes?

193
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,239
Who d'you think's right? C'mon, tell us.

194
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,359
I'm sure it's the agent!
-Pretty sure it's Aslam.

195
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,970
What...

196
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,958
What was that?

197
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,879
Did you miss it, kiddiewink?

198
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:45,788
He threw us a flower...

199
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:53,004
You only do that when you want to keep company with someone... Or part company at a funeral...

200
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,460
W -- Wh -- What is this place?

201
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,420
Madame Ruby's drum.

202
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:09,050
Don't worry though. I was worried too... But two years here and I dread the thought of leaving!

203
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,592
I ain't goin' back to bein' boracic...

204
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,720
That number's never gonna take your call!

205
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,120
What d'you mean?

206
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,383
Two million, was it? Your husband to-be just made himself a fortune...

207
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,255
This number is switched off.

208
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,281
I swear by God, sir...

209
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,139
Everything I've told you is true.

210
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,970
Please... For the sake of someone's honour...

211
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,250
Her grandfather couldn't take it... He had a heart attack...

212
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:28,610
Sir... I'm worried... Her family's worried... Please, help us if you know anything... Tell us what you know...

213
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,416
Anything...

214
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:41,134
In truth, I couldn't really believe them...

215
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:46,510
But... I feared God...

216
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,983
And helped them a bit...

217
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,506
Looking at you...

218
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:05,800
I can see the truth etched on your face...

219
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,650
It's all...

220
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,215
Crystal clear...

221
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,440
What do you know?

222
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,849
Of course, I know your address.

223
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:26,470
Besides, everyone in Defence knows you.

224
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:32,990
I'll just ask a cabbie to take me to Madame Ruby's.

225
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,258
I don't need a house number or street.

226
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:39,375
Yeah, she's with me...

227
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:43,230
What are you doing out here?

228
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,840
It's not safe. Go. I'll get you some tea...

229
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,682
Madame Ruby?

230
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:06,234
Still out cold...

231
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:17,927
Her lover's sold her... She's down with regret... She won't be getting up before she's done regretting...

232
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,948
Good evening, Saqib.
-'Evening.

233
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,135
How's Nadia?

234
00:27:32,837 --> 00:27:39,527
The same as always... The same as eight years ago... Yet, another day passes and you ask again...

235
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:46,030
You may leave now. I'm here. Here's your salary.

236
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,193
Thank you so much.

237
00:27:57,193 --> 00:28:00,157
Dinner's in the fridge. Please, have something.

238
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:00,977
Thank you.

239
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:02,824
Good night.

240
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,090
Hey...

241
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,923
You've been on this bed, counting the days...

242
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:47,700
Not one night have I slept peacefully...

243
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,710
Ever since <i>he</i> destroyed our lives... Our world...

244
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,251
Eight years... Eight long years...

245
00:28:57,251 --> 00:29:05,370
That's how long it took your brother to avenge you.

246
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:13,470
But Karma caught up with that man today... He tried to sully someone's honour...

247
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:23,210
And now he stands to answer for it!

248
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,935
I sold the geezer's girl to a whorehouse.

249
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,162
Our report for the last year, sir.

250
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:40,502
682 students study in 14 schools in these districts.

251
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:48,450
Our organisation's been trying to start two new schools every year. That's why we've been working --

252
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,980
And who would that be? Your son?

253
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,491
Sir?

254
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:57,105
No. He's my brother, Saqib.

255
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:06,000
Why d'you always have him around... Surely not at this age? Just... Let the lad play...

256
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,946
Siddiq!

257
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,561
Show the young lad around our lawn. Get him some juice, okay?

258
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:18,178
Come.
-Go.

259
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:22,865
And get some sherbet for us too.

260
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,448
I'm sure you wouldn't mind some...?

261
00:30:28,948 --> 00:30:32,980
So, Mr Malik... How much would you donate to our schools?

262
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,001
Ten grand...

263
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,467
Ten grand... Twenty...

264
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,202
Ten grand... Twenty... Fifty...

265
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,523
Ten grand... Twenty... Fifty... A hundred...

266
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:39,636
Ten grand... Twenty... Fifty... A hundred... Two, or if you will...

267
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,647
Ten grand... Twenty... Fifty... A hundred... Two, or if you will, five...

268
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,281
It depends entirely on how much you can...

269
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,947
That'll be enough, Mr Malik!

270
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:55,178
I'll take my leave.

271
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,530
Where are you off to?

272
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,230
Get off me, Mr Malik!

273
00:30:59,854 --> 00:31:06,755
You're -- You're getting it all wrong! Get off me! Geroff --

274
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,753
One more step and I'll jump!

275
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,760
I ain't seeing this act for the first time.

276
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,443
The last time someone said that, I said, 'Be my guest'.

277
00:31:40,443 --> 00:31:43,150
Scared the pants off her...

278
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,398
What a shame...

279
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:48,947
I swear I'll kill myself!

280
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:55,732
Big words... Ain't gonna believe it until I see it... Go on...

281
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,283
Nadia...

282
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,954
Nadia...

283
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,813
Nadia...

284
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:45,653
Wasn't it fair? What I did?

285
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,270
Nadia?

286
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,160
Did I do something wrong?

287
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,852
Nadia?

288
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,190
I just avenged you...

289
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,103
Roshni...

290
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,843
R -- Roshni...

291
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,060
Roshni!

292
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,398
Roshni...?

293
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,204
Roshni...

294
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,460
Roshni...!

295
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,922
My girl... Where are you?

296
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,218
Sir?

297
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,844
I'd like a cuppa.
-'Sec!

298
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,098
Hello?

299
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:44,640
Our knight's willing to put everything on the line for his princess, but this time around, she's not even his! Never was, never will be!

300
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,130
Why'd you call me?

301
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:57,528
Thought I'd congratulate you. The man who'd jump in to save so much as a dead leaf falling from the tree etched with his love's name...

302
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:11,230
Pure love, blind love, selfless love... There's a thousand ways to love, but yours is the thousand-and-fifty-first - pig-headed love!

303
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,740
You could sacrifice your life for her, but the most she'd ever say is 'Thank you'.

304
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,030
There are no ways to love...

305
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:27,215
It's the way of those willing to live and die for the oath.

306
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,466
But you won't get it.

307
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,332
What would you know love?

308
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:46,420
You only know hatred... It's what defines you, it's the only thing you ever feel... And perhaps the only thing you believe in.

309
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,663
Ain't so easy for you to get it...

310
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:04,830
I feel like cracking up... Doubling up in stitches until I'm all in tears... But my eyes fall on the kid... <i>Her</i> kid...

311
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:12,283
I so wish a laugh could knock your slumbering morality up.

312
00:36:13,545 --> 00:36:15,436
No, Adam...

313
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,290
Don't say that...

314
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,338
I'd mind it if anyone else said that...

315
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:25,099
But... Hearing it from you... Pains me...

316
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,960
What if I don't want to be loved back?

317
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,640
It's sinful to ask for anything in return when you find happiness in theirs...

318
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,318
It'd be so insulting to our hearts...

319
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,600
First time in years someone's bitter words have pained me...

320
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,000
