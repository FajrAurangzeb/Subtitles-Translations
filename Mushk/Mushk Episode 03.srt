1
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,867
It's been 40 days since your mother passed away.

2
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,904
I never had the time between the grief and the tears...

3
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:54,746
But?

4
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,297
But I had your mother promise me before she passed away...

5
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:02,214
Promise what?

6
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:07,263
We betrothed you to Masooma.

7
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:10,982
She's your fiancée now.

8
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:45,780
Your orphaned childhood... Our love for you... Everything we ever did to make sure you never felt neglected... Didn't you think of anything before refusing?

9
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,603
I remember everything.

10
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:54,467
But Masooma's my sister. She's 15 years younger than me! Didn't you think of that?

11
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:57,306
It makes no difference.

12
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,413
Khadija's much younger than me... About 15 years.

13
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:09,677
Besides, I'm not asking you to get married right away.

14
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:12,068
Just... Accept it.

15
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,601
Get married a couple of years later, when Masooma comes of age.

16
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:23,578
I beg you, Uncle.

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,621
I've held Masooma most dear... But as a sister! I mean... I've been her brother from her youngest days!

18
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:37,238
That's unfair... You're doing injustice to me, to her, to our bond... Just look at her age!

19
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:40,470
She's my sister. My sister!

20
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,900
She was, yes.

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,103
She's your fiancée now.

22
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:49,154
Your mother made a promise.

23
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:57,426
Let her grow up. Let her study. I thought we were past the dark ages when we'd get girls her age married off!

24
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:02,530
I'm not the one for her... God forgive that I ever think of it!

25
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,458
Besides, I've gotten ma --
-Not a word!

26
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,777
Not one more word!

27
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,641
Don't make me send you to your lonely Mum!

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm descended from Badshah Khan... And Masooma from Asher Khan.

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,710
There's no one else who even comes close, let alone equal us.

30
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,873
You're the only man in the family.

31
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:39,354
I'm sparing your life in exchange for your acceptance!

32
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
I'm never coming back here again!

33
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,396
Mehek!

34
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,500
Open the door!

35
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,328
Jesus... Why've you locked it? Guards!
-Where are you, Mehek!?

36
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,524
Break it open!
-Mehek!

37
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,028
Hello?

38
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,842
Hello? Shayan?

39
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,771
Shay --

40
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,370
The name's Asher Khan. They call me the fortunate one.

41
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,754
Those who take up arms against me aren't so fortunate.

42
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,790
Lock him up!

43
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,980
What?

44
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,891
I said lock him up!

45
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,860
Sir!

46
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,343
Yes?

47
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,584
This Mir Adam?
-Aye.

48
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,017
Thank you.

49
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,064
Not so fast!

50
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,577
Good Lord... 102...

51
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:43,130
I'll call the doctor.
-No... No need... I'll take the pill. I'll be fine.

52
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,138
Why'd you have to get all wet?

53
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:51,570
Mum told me you never liked playing in the rain. When'd it grow on you?

54
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,428
Just yesterday?

55
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,917
Blimey... I'll get you some yahni.

56
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,994
Sir...
-Yeah?

57
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,897
Where does Malik Nureddin live?

58
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:38,306
Take a right here, then a left, then right again, and you'll be on a road straight to his manor.

59
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,710
Thank you.
-Take care.

60
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,306
You're coming with us!

61
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,857
Step on the gas!

62
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,110
No, Saqib, I can't...

63
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,998
No!

64
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:41,122
Good Lord, Saqib... I haven't got the courage!

65
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,494
Hmm... In other words you don't love me.

66
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:47,770
No way I'm vaulting the wall!

67
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,038
I mean just -- How?

68
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,805
Just like the other girls.

69
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:53,980
One of your friend's coming to meet one of mine... Come with her.

70
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,239
No way, Saqib.

71
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,282
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:58,282 --> 00:10:01,460
C'mon, the van's here.

73
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,540
I'm coming in a second. Bag a seat for me!
-Okay.

74
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,766
I'm going, Saqib.

75
00:10:11,766 --> 00:10:17,071
By your life and my love, if you didn't come...

76
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm gonna slit my wrist. No chance I'm making it out of this alive.

77
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,381
You're mad?

78
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,280
I've got the knife on my wrist!

79
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,697
Jesus... Throw it away!

80
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,893
On three...

81
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,954
One...

82
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,990
The knife's right on my vein...

83
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,647
Two...

84
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,900
Just a little more pressure and I'll be gone, thanks to you...

85
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,630
For God's sake, Saqib... Don't even think about it!

86
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,922
Just say yes... Or my breaths will die out by the time you take your next gasp!

87
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm about to say three...

88
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,040
Yeah... I'll be there.

89
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,516
Hey! Untie me you dunderheads!

90
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:22,191

Water...

00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,012
Anyone here? I need water...

111
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,260
Water...

112
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:27,965
Water... My throat's drying up! Get me some water!

113
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:41,150
H -- Here... Wh -- What are you doing? Blimey! Get away!

114
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,340
What are you doing?

115
00:13:44,340 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm giving you a taste of it for trampling my life under your feet. I want you to feel how you barged into my life, encroached on my heart, my mind, and my life!

116
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,190
I've come this far on this thorny road barefoot. It is time you tasted the blood on my feet!

117
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,628
What do you mean?

118
00:14:09,628 --> 00:14:12,773
My helplessness

119
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:19,602
That you forced my body and my soul into,

120
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:31,310
Wagering my kids' share, my jewellery... And losing it all! I still remember how you had the audacity to barge back in without a shred of remorse...

121
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:45,467
I still remember my helplessness... For my marriage, my family's honour, and my children... I couldn't say a word!

122
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,522
You bringing a new woman home every night...

123
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,766
Oh, Mr Malik...

124
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,330
One look at you...

125
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,604
Drove me crazy...

126
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,510
You've given me so many sleepless nights!

127
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,499
It's your love, Mr Malik...
-Innit?

128
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,898
Mr Malik's love indeed...

129
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,862
What is going on?

130
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,788
Who's she?

131
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,166
The Empress...

132
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,514
She's gonna be my Empress tonight...

133
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:46,734
Didn't her beauty tell you?

134
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,948
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

135
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,770
Ever thought about your daughters?

136
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,351
You gonna lecture me?

137
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:01,520
Lemme teach you some manners!

138
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,280
Come! I'll show you!

139
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:17,252
Having to live with this knot in my heart after your betrayal...

140
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,450
Mum... I'm scared...

141
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,353
Why'd Dad beat you?

142
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,201
Feel the helplessness yet?

143
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,813
FEEL IT YET?

144
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,549
What happened, Zulaikha?

145
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,638
She's gone raving mad --

146
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:58,341
Nothing! This man dropped the glass!

147
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,080
I'll let you go if you don't say a word.

148
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,916
Or I'll strangle you with that tongue of yours!

149
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,809
Are we clear?

150
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,845
Eh?

151
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,610
Where are we going?

152
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,418
Not far.

153
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,807
But where?

154
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,714
Paradise.

155
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:40,339
A paradise for lease.

156
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:49,130
I'm very worried. Please tell me clearly.
-Hey! Who's worried about going to Paradise? By the way, the lease is for your safety.

157
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,125
You telling me or want me to go back?

158
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,340
Okay... It's an internet café. That's what the board says, at least.

159
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,390
Closed down a year ago. Now it's a place for lovers to meet, to make fond memories to look back upon.

160
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,980
For 500 bucks an hour. Ain't that wonderful?

161
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,738
No. I'm not going to that sort of a place.

162
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:14,780
It's safe! Bet your head it's the safest lovers' point in the city!

163
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:22,726
Put on some lipstick before you get there. I'll give it to you. It'll be the icing on the cake!

164
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,795
No way!

165
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,220
Bring him here.

166
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,167
Aye...

167
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,017
They did...

168
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,127
Okay.

169
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,895
The day after tomorrow, it is.

170
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:58,906
And so my claws managed to seize your hooves...

171
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:01,642
You should've known...

172
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,950
Then again, I'm glad you got to see it firsthand...

173
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,155
Lock him in!

174
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,160
Where was he off to?

175
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,175
I know the place...

176
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,364
But why?

177
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:25,645
You'll know it in two days, Mr Khan.

178
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,038
Good morning, ma'am.

179
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:42,443
'Morning.

180
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:45,194
Did Dad have breakfast?

181
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:57,066
Yeah. Two hours ago. Then left for Hasilpore. He said the Tribal Council's meeting there. Adam was a bit under the weather so he took Qutbuddin with him.

182
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:02,180
Okay... Tell Rukhsana I want some tea.

183
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,948
She went home.

184
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:06,484
Who let her?

185
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:17,565
No one. She didn't ask you as you were sleeping. Left in tears. The folks at the village caught her husband stealing and beat him real bad.

186
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:20,571
It's 9.30 already...

187
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,794
Hey...
-Yeah?

188
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:31,896
Go and tell her - what's her name - the girl who came here with Mehek - to get me some tea.
-Okay.

189
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,983
Who's there?

190
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:41,944
Munna!

191
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,840
What's your problem?

192
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,679
Madame's calling you.

193
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,878
Well, then, what's her problem?

194
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:57,294
She wants to have tea. Rukhsana's gone home, so she asked me to tell you to prepare the dinner.

195
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,265
Why, she paralysed or something?
-Blimey, what are you saying?

196
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,050
You heard me.

197
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,330
She'll be really angry.

198
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:23,140
Oh really? Try me. Her anger's no more than a puny insect before mine! One shout and I can stomp the life out of it! Get it?

199
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,214
Please...
-Oh, put a sock in it!

200
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:38,428
Or I'm gonna twist your arm and smite you proper! Can you see your cheeks going red, then blue? Now go. Get going before I feel like doing it!

201
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,200
Told her?

202
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,051
Of course...

203
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,852
Okay.

204
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,661
Here.

205
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,140
What's up?

206
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,406
Just... Let me go...

207
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:55,645
Why are you running away from me?
-I'm running away from everyone.

208
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,730
But from this guy?

209
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,385
Okay, sit.
-This is wrong.

210
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:04,997
I don't like this place.

211
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,587
Munna!

212
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,513
Munna!

213
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,199
Yes?

214
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,910
I asked for tea an hour ago. How much time does she need?

215
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,606
W -- Well...

216
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,544
I asked you something!

217
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:28,392
I'll get you in a moment.

218
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,203
Why?

219
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:33,120
I told you to ask her.

220
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,636
I did.

221
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:36,183
What'd she say?

222
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,837
More than I could hear.

223
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,390
What do you mean?

224
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,757
Guddi said she's not getting up.

225
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:49,167
Did you tell her I called her?
-Yes.

226
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,700
Girl, are you lookin' for trouble!

227
00:24:53,862 --> 00:24:55,373
Guddi!

228
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,717
Guddi!

229
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,827
Guddi!

230
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:08,188
Guddi!

231
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,421
Guddi!

232
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:28,138
Munna came to rouse you. Told you I sent for you.

233
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,097
Get up! Right now!

234
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,093
What are you looking at?

235
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:52,518
Lower your gaze.

236
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,190
Lower your gaze or --

237
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:08,560
You better mind your eyes, tongue, and hands. I won't think twice before gouging your eyes out, cutting that foul tongue, or breaking those insolent arms. Are we clear?

238
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,332
Get off me!

239
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,920
I'll cut you down to size! Who do you think you are? You ruddy maid! Get off!

240
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:29,670
Think twice before looking at me that way, opening that mouth, or raising your hand! You won't get away so easily next time. You better remember it, because I will.

241
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,587
What's wrong with you? What were you thinking?

242
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:56,343
Are you touched in the head, Guddi?

243
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,973
Jesus... What've you done?

244
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,969
Destroyed everything...

245
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:13,432
Were you out of your mind? You've ruined everything!

246
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:19,647
So you think it's wrong... What you feel about me, that is...

247
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:28,395
Funny because I've always heard that you never care about right or wrong in love.

248
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:37,580
But it seems you haven't started going down the road of love... Even if you've charted your course!

249
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,176
Get a move on! Or you'll never get where you want.

250
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:46,450
You've got your own ways of 'measuring' love.

251
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,270
You forgot that a girl cares just as much about her family's honour as her love.

252
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,067
Okay... Have it your way...

253
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,870
But just stay here five minutes?

254
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,048
No... The van would be there any minute...

255
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:09,972
More like half an hour. Just be with me for five minutes. For me?

256
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,700
Munna!

257
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,171
Munna!

258
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:17,425
Yes, ma'am?

259
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:23,420
Go and ask the guard to load his gun and be ready! I need him!

260
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,640
Go!
-Ma'am...

261
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm getting late... I should get going.

262
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,330
Just a minute... I've got something for you. Don't you want to see it?

263
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:57,910
I'll put them on when I get back.

264
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,724
I've come here to put them on you myself.

265
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:08,970
I thought I'd look into your eyes when putting them on you. Get this Heavenly feeling...

266
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:19,780
As I tuck your lovely tresses behind your ears, making your heart and mine skip a beat...

267
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:31,511
And, blinded by the goddess of love wearing these earrings, I'd quietly shut my eyes.

268
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,410
You're comin' with us!
-Come out!
-Take him!

269
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:47,470
Saqib! N -- No! He didn't --
-Come!

270
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,000
I didn't...
-I'll tell you!

271
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,840
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Your family, what'd they think?
-No! We didn't -- We're not! No! Saqib!

272
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,847
Load your guns!

273
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,141
Ready?

274
00:30:06,141 --> 00:30:09,280
Aim for her head.

275
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,389
Feel free to fill her with lead if she dares move, speak, or think!

276
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,690
Munna! Pick up her bags.

277
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,827
No -- Aunt... No... Please...

278
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,171
Thought you could get away with it, eh?

279
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:43,080
Come! Get out!
-Forgive her, Aunt!

280
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:49,710
Munna! Take her kid. Get a carriage. Come!
-No... Please, Aunt...

281
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:56,710
For the love of God, Aunt... Please forgive her!
-I'll show you!

282
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,220
Please, Aunt! She was really tired!
-Come!

283
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,350
No! She doesn't think when she's -- No, Aunt!
-Get lost!

284
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:11,443
Please, Aunt... She's helpless -- And -- Think of the kid... What's his fault?

285
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,924
The helpless listen more than they speak!

286
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:23,319
Please forgive her, Aunt! I beg you!

287
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,009
Uncle...

288
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:31,736
Quickly, Uncle...

289
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:35,300
Let me finish my tea.

290
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,770
Madame's gonna kill me! Have two cups once you're back.

291
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,805
Your house on fire or something?
-More or less. It's searing everyone!

292
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,915
Come.
-Come.

293
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,300
Sit down!

294
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,866
On the floor. Bloody Princess Charmings.

295
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,127
Please let us go. We haven't done anything.

296
00:32:16,127 --> 00:32:19,900
Oh, please. If you ask me, you've done worse than murder.

297
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,697
For you've murdered your family's honour.

298
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:30,680
Look at yourself, smirching your family's name and saying you haven't done anything!

299
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,060
Not another word, okay?

300
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,363
We're gonna do as the inspector says.

301
00:32:37,363 --> 00:32:39,689
Please... No...

302
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:42,355
No...

303
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,743
Here.

304
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,660
To the station.

305
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:27,358
You didn't get to your destination... But it appears you got the chance to nick a pair of shoes from there.

306
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:41,908
You soured the celebration in a moment...

307
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:58,666
Forget about me... Why didn't you think of your restlessness, the sleepless nights spent helplessly tossing around in this cell?

308
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,540
Just... Why'd you get caught?

309
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:17,810
They say nothing equals your own happiness,

310
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:27,136
Except that of your children.

311
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:35,979
You're not my son...

312
00:34:35,979 --> 00:34:39,426
Nor are you me...

313
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,972
But, for a moment, it felt like I had broken out...

314
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:56,706
As if I was, at long last, free.

315
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,660
But you got caught...

316
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,303
Alas...

317
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,875
Caught...

318
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,288
Have you seen my sister, Uncle?
-No.

319
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,885
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it... Yes?

320
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,850
Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

321
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,260
We've called the parents of everyone... Except her, who won't say a word!

322
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,372
And the lad's one daft baddie too!

323
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:11,756
She's always itching to give your type a proper beating. It won't be pretty if you angered her. Begging for mercy won't work with her. You've been warned.

324
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:14,640
So... Lemme ask you again...

325
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,521
What's your Dad's name?

326
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,470
What's his name?

327
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,665
Malik Ahmed.

328
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,660
Where do you live?

329
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,959
Mir Adam.

330
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:51,010
My boy...

331
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:04,783
This number is switched off.

332
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,843
This number is switched off.

333
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:33,092
Don't worry, Mehek. You know it's four hours before the train gets there. I'll do the chores and dash in half an hour. Please don't cry.

334
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,447
Promise?
-Promise.

335
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,830
M'boy...

336
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
