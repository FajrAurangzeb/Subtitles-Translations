1
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:31,690
The most priceless of trust is that between husband and wife...

2
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,560
Cursed are those...

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,570
Who leave this world, unaware that their wives...

4
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,120
Chose to two-time shamelessly right under their noses...

5
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,050
Why'd you stop at wives?

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,117
I've seen a few cheating women...

7
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,845
But countless more cheating men...

8
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,410
Only because...

9
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:08,210
I'm talking about <i>my</i> wife...

10
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,000
She's a woman...

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,100
You're her means...

12
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,270
You're the chance she got...

13
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,217
That her cheating self seized, ripping through her honour.

14
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,820
But I want to thank you with a hug, Doctor... You've been kind.

15
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:44,336
Most welcome, Mr Malik... You are <i>most</i> welcome...

16
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,440
You know...

17
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,176
What this is?

18
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,483
This toxin will spread through my body in a minute...

19
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:28,383
And I'll be flailing on the floor as it destroys my body...

20
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,900
But I've got...

21
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,818
Enough time -- To deal -- With you!

22
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,840
Back when... You couldn't even get up --

23
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,215
Remember when you heard a glass break in your room...

24
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:53,060
And you asked your wife who it was...

25
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,990
And she said it's her...

26
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,750
G -- Guess what?

27
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,637
I -- I heard -- it too that night --

28
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,891
You bloody lech!
-You...

29
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,527
You may've killed me...

30
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:18,338
But I've killed your honour a thousand times!

31
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,050
You're furious now --

32
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:33,340
But when you cool down -- Your conscience -- Won't let you sleep!

33
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,080
Your wife's betrayal...

34
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,924
Will always be there to bug you... Gnaw at you...

35
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:43,683
Your wife...

36
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:48,045
<i>Your</i> lovely wife...

37
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,110
Has been mine...

38
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,098
All this time...

39
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,293
I've said it a hundred times... I won't tell him anything!

40
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,147
You never cared about relations... But I still respect you.

41
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,524
Promise me.

42
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,190
How's she?

43
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,820
She doesn't need your fake sympathies, you vile two-timer!

44
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,703
It's not fake... I swear!

45
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:24,007
I've asked the winds, the walls, and my memories how she is all this time!

46
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,405
K -- Kill me if you want... But tell me how she is.
-She's dead.

47
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,020
She's dead.

48
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,255
Waiting to be buried but not quite ready yet.

49
00:06:35,255 --> 00:06:38,416
Because her heart still beats for you.

50
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:43,400
Her corpse lives to see the day you come back...

51
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,692
Why?
-What could I do?

52
00:06:45,692 --> 00:06:52,004
Why'd you get married if you couldn't fulfil your vows?
-What the devil could I do?

53
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:58,440
I was leaving after Mum's funeral when...
-Not a word!

54
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,090
Don't make me send you to your lonely Mum!

55
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,507
You're the only man in the family.

56
00:07:06,507 --> 00:07:11,033
I'm sparing your life in exchange for your acceptance!

57
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,390
Jesus... Why've you locked it? Guards!

58
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,290
Break it open!
-Mehek!

59
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,910
The name's Asher Khan. They call me the fortunate one.

60
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,350
Those who take up arms against me aren't so fortunate.

61
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,240
Lock him up!

62
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,520
What?

63
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,501
I said lock him up!

64
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,950
And?

65
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,794
I broke out...

66
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,400
You're coming with us!

67
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,240
Step on the gas!

68
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,311
How could you get married again?

69
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,423
Huh?

70
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:17,142
In your place, I would've chosen death!

71
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,540
You got a sister?

72
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

73
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,609
Khawar!

74
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:33,030
Divorced her yet?
-You didn't order me to.

75
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,961
Do it.

76
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,430
I, Khawar Maqbool Hussain, do s --
-No!

77
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,050
Please, no... Don't do that to me...

78
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,355
Please... I'll do what you say...

79
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:48,764
You don't need to do anything...

80
00:09:48,764 --> 00:09:52,316
Only your brother can save you now.

81
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,368
Tell him to do as I say.

82
00:09:55,368 --> 00:10:02,752
Just do as he says... Save me... My family... My kids... Please...

83
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,280
What if it were you and your sister instead?

84
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,940
I would've chosen death, Shayan...

85
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,655
Because I can't be so cruel as to marry a 12-year-old! You're a sinner!

86
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,668
No.

87
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,279
I don't believe any of it.

88
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,013
Believe it...

89
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:39,803
Believe it... Or kill me.

90
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,742
Mehek wants a divorce.

91
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,109
Sign it.

92
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,928
Don't worry.

93
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,730
There are no conditions...

94
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,680
Except one...

95
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,054
You will never see your son.

96
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,354
My son?

97
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,954
Yeah.

98
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,588
Your unfortunate son.

99
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,250
Sign it.

100
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,368
No... No way...

101
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,943
I can't...

102
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,223
What d'you want?

103
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:54,504
I want --

104
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:58,995
To be with Mehek... As long as I live...

105
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,810
You ready to leave all of this behind and come with me?

106
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,119
You ready to leave all of this behind and come with me?
-Yes.

107
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,130
Yes.

108
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,357
Go, then.

109
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,678
Go set the little girl free.

110
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:25,690
Beg her forgiveness.

111
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,374
Okay...

112
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,034
Go.

113
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,580
And...

114
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,440
How many guards has he got? And where?

115
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,808
Two at the gate... Outside...

116
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:50,640
And... Two inside... At the back...

117
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,550
Armed... All of them...

118
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,947
Go.

119
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,748
Pack your bags.

120
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,222
Free her.

121
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,200
I'll take care of the guards.

122
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,078
Munna...

123
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,911
D'you know a lion hunts here at night?

124
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:39,356
What? A lion?

125
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:43,620
It devoured the kids of two labourers very recently.

126
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,310
Then -- Why've you brought me here?

127
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,735
Munna...

128
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,620
I've got a question...

129
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,012
Satisfy me...

130
00:14:58,012 --> 00:15:00,247
And we go back...

131
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,945
Y -- Yeah? Ask away...

132
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,279
Who's Guddi's fancy man?
-No idea... Really... I don't know...

133
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,930
No idea... Really... I don't know...

134
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,590
Alright... Keep your secrets...

135
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,250
I'll get going. Nope! <i>Just</i> me!

136
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:26,074
You're spending the night here... With the poor little starving lion... Bye!

137
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:34,340
Hey! All I know is Guddi looks after Adam a lot! Made him dinner last night... That's all I know...

138
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,661
Shh...

139
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,496
Good boy.

140
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,470
And...

141
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,940
One more thing...

142
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,236
I don't want anything... Just want to go home... Just let me go...

143
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,835
Easy, mate.

144
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:59,830
Come with me. Don't worry.

145
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,237
What have we here?

146
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:15,310
Eh?

147
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,760
Why's everyone here?

148
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
Tyranny has to end sometime.

149
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,233
I get a feeling it ends tonight.

150
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,953
What?
-You heard me, old man!

151
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,950
Masooma... Come here...

152
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,015
C'mon.

153
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,660
I'm so sorry...

154
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,020
What we've done to you...

155
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,262
Deserves no forgiveness...

156
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:02,696
But if you forgive me...

157
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:07,322
Perhaps the Lord may hear your innocent prayers...

158
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,204
What was that guff?

159
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:14,087
Masooma...

160
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,407
I divorce you.
-Don't you dare!

161
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:26,921
Masooma... I divorce you... I DIVORCE YOU!
-Tauqir! Tauq --
-Shayan!

162
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,000
Uncle!

163
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,170
Dad!
-Uncle! Are you alright?

164
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,465
Dad!
-Shayan!

165
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:42,200
Dad!
-Help!
-Uncle...

166
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,160
Dad!
-Uncle...

167
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,950
Go... I'll take care of things here...
-Call someone! Uncle!
-Dad...

168
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,310
Dad...
-Help! Uncle...

169
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,367
Dad... Mum?

170
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,990
Dad!

171
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,570
My son's a young man...

172
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,970
So I showed up without thinking of the time...

173
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,470
I only realised it's late when I got here...

174
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,330
Adam told me everything...

175
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:27,660
I felt a bit angry when I saw you feeding my son last night...

176
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:36,509
But when Adam told me everything... I was glad to know someone loves him so much...

177
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,046
Unlike Mehek... She just uses him...

178
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:48,616
She has her reasons...
-Whatever.

179
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:52,295
I just thought I'd let you know...

180
00:19:52,295 --> 00:19:55,275
You're never poor, helpless and alone...

181
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:58,305
For you've got me...

182
00:19:58,305 --> 00:20:02,014
It's the Scrooges who are broke...

183
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:09,664
I've seen the richest of men serve those who can love gladly.

184
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,778
I'll get going...

185
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,708
Take care.

186
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,266
Allow me.

187
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,784
Good night.

188
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,960
What?
-Divorce papers.

189
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,930
Aye, why'd I need them now?

190
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,338
That's it. You don't.

191
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,941
Who are you?
-Adam.

192
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,713
You risked your life to save me.

193
00:21:38,228 --> 00:21:45,910
You're driving so fast... But not running from them... No, you're eager to get there...

194
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,080
So... Once again...

195
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,730
Who are you?

196
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,286
Who's Mehek to you?

197
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,310
Just a neighbour...

198
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,370
Who feels for her...

199
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,083
A friend, if you will...

200
00:22:16,908 --> 00:22:22,893
Haven't seen people who feel for others gather so much courage...

201
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,325
Feeling their pain gives me courage, Shayan.

202
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,767
Mind if I said something?

203
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,500
Your son's so cute, mate...

204
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:51,462
I pray that I blink and what I see on your forehead vanish like the illusion it is.

205
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,802
What d'you see?
-Waiting for that vile man.

206
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,833
You're just seeing things.
-No.

207
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,508
By the Lord, I'm not.

208
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:16,210
My sixth sense has always served me well...

209
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,870
Every time I saw things like that...

210
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,500
The wretches turned out to be true...

211
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,063
Okay, yeah...

212
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,650
I hate him for his betrayal...

213
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,970
Detest him...

214
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,338
I know it was Dad's fault...

215
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:45,299
And it was my fault that I'm his daughter...

216
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:50,900
But why'd he make my pure and innocent love suffer like this?

217
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,886
Guddi!

218
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,260
What is it?

219
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,090
Guddi!

220
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,172
Ie?

221
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:14,733
Ad -- Adam's had an accident! He's in hospital!

222
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,783
What?

223
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,498
Jeez... My phone died...

224
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,270
Adam...

225
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,039
In the car. Quick!

226
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,335
To the hospital. Double time!

227
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,620
G -- Gu -- Guddi...

228
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,941
What's up with your phone?

229
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,567
Adam...

230
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,793
Faster!

231
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,705
We're almost there.

232
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,800
Just about an hour away...

233
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:47,487
From the purest and most beautiful moment of your life... Holding your son for the first time...

234
00:27:48,103 --> 00:27:51,413
May the Lord will so.
-Amen.

235
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,631
Where are we? That sure ain't the hospital.

236
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,288
Hello?

237
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,154
Who -- What are you doing?

238
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,670
Where are you taking me?

239
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,005
Geroff me!

240
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,340
My apologies...

241
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,270
For squeezing your hand...

242
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:03,080
And pulling your wrist...

243
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,153
When I brought you here from the car...

244
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:11,210
I'm sorry I had to trouble you...

245
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,478
Perhaps even hurt you...

246
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:27,916
But I swear it hurts me much more to think how much you've suffered!

247
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:44,340
At this speed, they think I'm too eager to end your story...

248
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,600
But...

249
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,749
I swear I'm not...

250
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,270
In my two years on that bed...

251
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,536
I've lost whatever little faith I had on everything...

252
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,070
Who knows...

253
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,162
Today might be the last day I walk on my feet... Or walk this earth...

254
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,424
I don't want my longing for you to bother me in my grave...

255
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,300
Which is why...

256
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,323
The Reverend's coming here after Mass to get us married.

257
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,570
May the Lord bless us...

258
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,923
Tell me...

259
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,751
Yeah?

260
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:57,747
Just say Adam's fine and you lied...

261
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,640
Of course he is.

262
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,766
I lied.

263
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,804
Thank you, my Lord...

264
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,891
Alright, then, old man...

265
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:38,410
Princes and peers have turned into puny paupers after I'm through with them...

266
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:44,141
Failure's eager to see you like family on Christmas.

267
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,618
Guddi can only be Adam's, Malik!

268
00:32:58,618 --> 00:32:59,822
You bloody...

269
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:01,383
You bloody treacherous...

270
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:03,716
You bloody treacherous wretch!

271
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:12,961
My heart never listened to my mind... What d'you think it'd listen to you?

272
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,084
Come.

273
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:30,658
Here.

274
00:33:32,006 --> 00:33:35,840
Give it to me... Freshen up. Over there.

275
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,797
Shayan...

276
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,500
You're where you belong.

277
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,139
Just a little while before daybreak...

278
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:53,567
She'll be right before your eyes soon.

279
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,728
I pray...

280
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,188
Where were you, Adam?

281
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:03,060
I've been up all night waiting for you!

282
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,187
Uhh...

283
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:05,574
My sister...

284
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:07,645
Say hello to Shayan.

285
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,976
Hello.

286
00:34:08,976 --> 00:34:10,559
Hey.

287
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,630
Get something for him.

288
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,408
Okay.

289
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:32,108
(Call to prayer)

290
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:45,400
God is the greatest...

291
00:35:46,300 --> 00:36:00,033
I bear witness that there is no god but God...

292
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:08,000
I bear witness that there is no god but God...

293
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I bear witness that there is no god but God...
