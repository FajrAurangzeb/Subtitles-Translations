1
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,467
What happened?

2
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,758
Too crippled by your repentance to look me in the eye?

3
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,470
True...

4
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,930
I've always been true...

5
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,590
To my love for you...

6
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:21,870
To the flimsy illusion you conjured up...

7
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,997
And to myself... All my life...

8
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:30,810
But you...

9
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,849
Like every puny liar before you, you tried erasing my truth with your lies...

10
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,450
Here to say sorry, I presume?

11
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,578
How selfish of you!

12
00:06:55,868 --> 00:07:01,258
I swear you're not really sorry or something... You just want to ease yourself...

13
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:08,290
Ease the burden that won't let you live in peace or die in peace...

14
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,914
By somehow 'earning' my forgiveness.

15
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:21,850
All I see is a selfish man, veiled behind regret, seeking to achieve another one of his ends.

16
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,988
That's true too...

17
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,348
But there's one more thing...

18
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:40,547
Something that I value more than my regret or easing the burden of my sin...

19
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:45,998
I loved you --
-Enough... Just... Shut up...

20
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:54,878
Love has been helpless for ages...

21
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:58,010
Don't insult it anymore.

22
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:05,307
The walls have ears... So stop it before they two-time the ground beneath them and crumble.

23
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,688
I'll answer everything you said...

24
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,370
I loved you too...

25
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:24,558
You were my first and last love...

26
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:27,650
Because I gave you...

27
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,437
Everything...

28
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,142
But now... I hate you...

29
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:43,637
As purely as I loved you.

30
00:08:43,637 --> 00:08:50,270
Because there's no truer hate than what follows true love...

31
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,700
Forgiveness is too valuable...

32
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,340
It's all I've got left...

33
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,668
So don't even think I'm gonna forgive you...

34
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,897
Big words...

35
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:13,970
When you've been betrayed, shaken... But somehow take it all in...

36
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,941
18 years starts to feel like 80...

37
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,912
May I look at you one last time?
-No!

38
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,030
Go!

39
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,440
Don't even leave your filthy footprints here!

40
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,816
I was so scared... He threatened to kill me... Told me there's a lion and all... Believe me!

41
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:08,389
Any idea where he could've taken her?
-To the estate.

42
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:16,236
What've I told him...

43
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:23,180
'Adam <3'

44
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,950
The Reverend's here!

45
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,708
Just say 'I will'...

46
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:28,098
And many congratulations will reverb in this room...

47
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,760
Refuse...

48
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,458
And gunfire will reverb here.

49
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,557
Bring the Reverend here!

50
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:21,250
... follow the path of Marriage, to love and honour each other for as long as you both shall live?

51
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,110
In this life and the next... I'll love and honour no one but my Adam!

52
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,998
What d'you think you're doing?

53
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,459
Sort it out between yourselves before calling me, Mr Malik.

54
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,770
Get out!

55
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Lemme tell you...

56
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,670
Don't even think about it!

57
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:54,497
I'll kill myself than let your sinful hands touch me! Back off!

58
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,640
Guddi!

59
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,677
Guddi...

60
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,650
Going somewhere?

61
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,958
Yeah. Just pray for me, okay?

62
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,619
Breakfast?

63
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:01,228
No, thanks.

64
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:03,959
Just... Pray for me.

65
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,859
Guddi!

66
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:16,719
Almost at the hospital... You'll be fine!

67
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:21,540
The doctors will save you... I pray you live long! Guddi!

68
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,948
You'll be fine... Guddi...

69
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,370
Guddi!

70
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,308
Guddi...

71
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,607
M'boy... Hush...

72
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,158
Yeah?

73
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,640
Does Mehek live here?

74
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,616
What do I tell her?

75
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,807
Tell her someone's dying to see her.

76
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,878
Okay...

77
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,330
You can't be --

78
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,977
S -- Shahmir's Dad?

79
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,618
Shahmir... Lovely name...

80
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,318
Come in!

81
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:40,097
Doctor... How's she? Please... Tell me everything... She'll be fine, right?

82
00:17:40,097 --> 00:17:47,101
She needs blood... O-. You wouldn't happen to know --
-I'm O-, doctor!

83
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:54,337
Give her every last drop of blood within me... But I pray you... Save her...

84
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:56,127
Okay...

85
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:59,118
Nurse! Come here!

86
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,999
Take him to the lab and check his blood group.
-Okay.
-Which way?

87
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,040
In the Lord's name...

88
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,870
In the Lord's name...
-Mehek!

89
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,180
Mehek!

90
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,840
What happened?
-It's -- Shahmir's Dad! He's here!

91
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,038
What?
-Yeah... Shahmir's Dad...

92
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,750
Shayan...

93
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,718
C'mon!

94
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,800
Quickly...

95
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,640
What happened? Why'd you stop here?

96
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,370
You sure it's him? Shayan...

97
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:49,899
I've waited so long... I can't believe it...

98
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:58,089
I've started seeing things... Hearing things... That made me come here like this... Only to find no one...

99
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:02,970
My heart is weak...

100
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,343
If he isn't here... My heart may not survive the pain...

101
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,657
I'd die...

102
00:21:13,657 --> 00:21:15,617
No, Mehek...

103
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:18,600
I swear by Shahmir...

104
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,298
How are you?

105
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:03,429
I'm fine but... How's she? She'll be fine, won't she?
-Let's hope...

Curse me...

126
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,208
Grab my collar and ask me...

127
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,078
Slap me if you want too...

128
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,600
But please... Don't torment me with this silence...

129
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,370
All of that is done...

130
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,678
To those who matter...

131
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:42,150
Your love makes you do it...

132
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,113
But... You don't matter to me anymore...

133
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:51,484
Your betrayal smothered my love.

134
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:56,475
I or my son don't care about you one bit!

135
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,080
You've wronged us both...

136
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,369
And this is your sentence...

137
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:09,240
Go. Just go!

138
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,438
I swear it's not my fault!

139
00:25:13,843 --> 00:25:19,480
Fate has been unkind...

140
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,248
Too unkind...

141
00:25:21,248 --> 00:25:23,438
Almost...

142
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,958
Like a mortal enemy...

143
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:39,219
Every moment I've lived without you, I've prayed to get to see you again...

144
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:49,120
Begged the declining dusk, the endless night, and the blinding day...

145
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,717
To have...

146
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,737
To have just an ounce of mercy...

147
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:01,138
It's not my fault...

148
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,660
But fate has been unkind... To both of us...

149
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:14,980
Then... Tell me... Give me reason to believe you're innocent! Tell me what happened!

150
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,070
My loyalty warns me against listening to a cheat like you...

151
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,944
Reminding, cautioning, screaming, and begging me not to fall for your lies again...

152
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,300
Alright...

153
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,000
I've never asked for anything in life...

154
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,361
Didn't know... Didn't want to know how...

155
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,000
You're the first thing I'm asking for, Guddi...

156
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,930
I've lost a lot in life...

157
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,157
A lot...

158
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,228
But you...

159
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,439
You're the first reward that's truly and sincerely mine... Let me reap it, mate...

160
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:44,141
You're fine now, Guddi...

161
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:47,682
So get up, byt. C'mon...

162
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,978
How's she, Doctor?

163
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:10,451
She's safe now. She'll come to any moment.

164
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,044
Thank you, my Lord...

165
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,267
Thank You...

166
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:19,310
Doctor...

167
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,160
If she's fine now, could I go? Got something to do...

168
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,257
Of course.

169
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:27,418
You may go.

170
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,924
Thank you.
-Okay.

171
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:04,120
I beg you... And my son...

172
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,767
To forgive me... For giving in...

173
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:13,477
For not being there for you... When you needed me the most...

174
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:25,960
My heart wants to believe everything you've said... It believes every word you've said...

175
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,397
But my mind warns me against it... Against falling for it again...

176
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:35,180
How do I pay a deaf ear to my mind?

177
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,130
It's suffered a lot...

178
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,977
Suffered a lot...

179
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,860
If you don't believe me... Ask Adam.

180
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,997
He got me out of that place.

181
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,748
What?

182
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,960
A -- Adam got you out?

183
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,398
Don't worry... Daddy's here...

184
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,057
Shahmir...

185
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,527
Enough...

186
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:17,169
I'm tired of living a suffocating lie...

187
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,191
I've got to tell Grandpa everything...

188
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:22,640
Gotta tell him...

189
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,910
Everything...

190
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,161
Yeah, Kheru?

191
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,008
No one here, Adam...

192
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,319
No one? Where'd he go?

193
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,280
Malik flippin' Jr!

194
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,370
Mehek... I made a big mistake...

195
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,397
What happened?

196
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,268
Malik Jr!

197
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:08,360
Where's he?

198
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Enough, Mehek...

199
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,710
Enough...

200
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:18,000
Adam won't 'yes' you this time. Where's Malik Jr?

201
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
