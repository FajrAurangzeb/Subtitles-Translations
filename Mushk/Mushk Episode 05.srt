1
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,570
Good day, sir.

2
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,060
Good day. Hello... Come here, love. Bless you.

3
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,199
Sit.

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,830
It feels so good to see you.

5
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,360
Thank you.

6
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,998
Thank you for considering me worthy of respect.

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,990
Hello, Uncle.

8
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,159
Bless you.

9
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,269
Sit.

10
00:01:09,554 --> 00:01:11,296
What happened?

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,818
Why are you crying?

12
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:15,973
I'm waiting...

13
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,370
For what?

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,498
For Shayan.

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,647
Yeah... I live in wait of seeing him...

16
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:38,210
I used to be hopeful that he'd come back...

17
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,270
But now...

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,570
There, now... Calm down...

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,160
Your Aunt's been waiting for you.

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,946
Go.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,220
Orders, Mr Khan?

22
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,173
My ears have longed to hear your orders, and my hands to carry them out.

23
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:11,950
Go to the lock-up.

24
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,175
Threaten him.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,515
Make him understand.

26
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,983
Press him.

27
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,620
Show him his sister's nightmarish future.

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,983
Do what you must to make him give in.

29
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:39,798
I will always serve you, and your descendants after you, Mr Khan...

30
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,192
Don't even think about running away with him.

31
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:15,910
I have the power to do that...

32
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,200
But He never gave me the will.

33
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,985
I'm taking both of you back.

34
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,770
Why should I believe Mehek sent you?

35
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,650
Do I look like a fibster, a trickster?

36
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,464
Oh, you look worse...

37
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,768
What do you mean?

38
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:53,023
Those who look like fibsters and tricksters are really just badly off...

39
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:59,943
That's why they never get a chance. Everyone's too... Careful around them.

40
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:04,544
They can't even sell their truth for spare change.

41
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:17,118
It is your innocent-eyed courtly ilk that can strike heads off without a mouse stirring!

42
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,840
You can call Mehek.

43
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,200
Call her my foot!

44
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,609
After all I had to go through to help her, I'll make sure her past catches up to her and erases her future!

45
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,520
And how do I know that snaky old hag hasn't sent you?

46
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,840
Where are you?

47
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,478
I'm with her.

48
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,290
Please don't let her go...

49
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,273
I'll fix everything here...

50
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,610
Just let Grandpa come back...

51
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,487
Good luck.

52
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,078
Gonna need it...

53
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,545
Yeah?
-Helo...

54
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,980
What is it this time?

55
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,674
You didn't get back.
-What do you want me to say that'll satiate you?

56
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:31,084
You want the money, you'll get it. Even if I have to sell my hide.

57
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,219
Why are you so angry?

58
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:37,550
You ain't tasted my anger yet... I'm just saying what you want to hear.

59
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,288
Aye, I'm a bit rough, but to the devil with that! Be glad you heard what you wanted!

60
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,871
All wrapped up in your chuffing selves!

61
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,529
You never bother how I'm doing, do you?

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,282
Where'd you get the money?

63
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:13,123
Doesn't look like you've got it.

64
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,249
Your promises were but a sandcastle...

65
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:37,339
The waves of time reduced it to rubble in moments...

66
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,444
Blimey... How you said...

67
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,048
I'm here to stop those tears.

68
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm here to give you every happiness in the world.

69
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm here to stand guard around you;

70
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,344
Always ready to face any sorrows coming your way.

71
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm here to keep those eyes shining bright with glee;

72
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,910
I'm here to stop your tears from drowning it out.

73
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,102
Hello?

74
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:46,457
Grandpa...

75
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:50,264
It's getting late... I'm so worried you aren't back.

76
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:55,448
Don't worry, love. I'll be there in half an hour.

77
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,553
Okay...

78
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,780
You left everything unfinished...

79
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,084
And never came back...

80
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,019
He'll be back...

81
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,533
I assure you.

82
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,482
Just... Pray...

83
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,660
You never told me you're your oppressor's blood.

84
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,868
Is he really your Uncle?

85
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:11,467
I used to say it proudly when the blood was warm... But silence took over when the blood turned cold.

86
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,475
What's wrong with you?

87
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:35,495
Aye, I'm a hustler. Taken many for a ride.

88
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,718
But not for myself.

89
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,914
There's three of us. Me, me sister, and me brother.

90
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:46,680
Tad never bothered to get his girls educated...

91
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,385
He spent everything for his son.

92
00:10:50,385 --> 00:11:00,625
Thought he'd become a great man... Support them when they're old... And guard his sisters...

93
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,960
So... Didn't he become a great man?

94
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,975
Oh, he's a great man... Very great, in fact.

95
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,830
Too great to even remain...

96
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,584
Too great to even remain... Human.

97
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,170
He got married...

98
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,759
And jetted off to Dubai with his wife.

99
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:29,090
And so my parents remain waiting for Godot...

100
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,312
I'm so sorry to hear that.

101
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:36,160
Are you, really?

102
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,215
Now imagine living it.

103
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:47,040
Tad always reined in on us. Made sure we grew up to be upright.

104
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:56,348
But with each cough in the middle of the night, the reins slipped from his hand as he reached for the pills we could never get him...

105
00:11:56,348 --> 00:12:03,460
Until one day, the neighbour refused to give me sister a piece of bread. She fainted...

106
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,490
That was it...

107
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,300
The one moment, the spark...

108
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,670
That charred the reins forever...

109
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:24,020
I forged a few papers and sold the neighbour's house. Soft target. Lonely, widowed... Thought I'd start with her.

110
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:34,630
That's when it grew on me... The quest for easy money became my closest friend...

111
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,669
Any way you could... You know... Go back?

112
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,908
Ie. Death.

113
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:51,068
There's no turning back for me in life. Not after everything I've gone through.

114
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,246
Hey!

115
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,817
How long before the train gets here?

116
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,913
It's two hours late already!

117
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:08,260
This isn't a big station. It's one for us plebs.

118
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:19,640
The toffs chuff chuff past this place, choking this puffed-out place! They don't stop for us!

119
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:29,563
Except one poor rustbucket...

120
00:13:29,563 --> 00:13:36,350
Full of decrepit men, famished kids, and their Mums on their uppers!

121
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:43,670
Just that one! No one else stops here for the plebs...

122
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,781
It broke down...

123
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:50,540
Over there near Sajjanpore.

124
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,110
No idea when it'll be here. In the morning, maybe? Come...

125
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,987
Absolutely no idea...

126
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,880
I'm not letting you go.

127
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:20,927
Who are you to stop me? Me oul' fella? I wouldn't care if you were. I don't even listen to him now.

128
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,227
Don't you need money for your sister's wedding?

129
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,680
I do.
-I can give you.

130
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,617
When?
-Right now.

131
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,980
I've asked someone to do something... He'll be here shortly.

132
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,890
The lengths you'd go to for Mehek!

133
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,410
Who's she to you?

134
00:14:52,410 --> 00:15:07,590
♪ <i>Not once did I ever speak,</i> ♪

135
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:13,700
♪ <i>But it's her my heart and soul seek,</i> ♪

136
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:24,550
♪ <i>Chanting on the rosary her name,</i> ♪

137
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:33,000
♪ <i>Keeping my yearning aflame...</i> ♪

138
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,610
Grandpa!

139
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,640
Grandpa!

140
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,330
What are you doing here? Out!

141
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,351
Grandpa! What took you so long?

142
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,040
I was so worried!

143
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,130
She was my responsibility...

144
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,697
She's got a wee kid... What if something happened to him?

145
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:12,647
Slow down... You're losing me... What happened?

146
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,050
Ready?

147
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,180
Aim for her head.

148
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,810
Come! Get out!
-Forgive her, Aunt!

149
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,690
For the love of God, Aunt... Please forgive her!
-I'll show you!

150
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,846
Get lost!
-Guddi!

151
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,910
Your sister's been most insensitive...
-Aye...

152
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,900
Sometimes, I feel the same.

153
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,979
Don't worry.

154
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,990
I'll talk to her.

155
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,450
We'll go bring her back ourselves.

156
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,430
Promise.
-If the Lord wills!

157
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,415
What are you doing, you mad woman? Get down! Qutbuddin! Qutb --

158
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,370
Get some sense into her!
-What happened? Zulaikha?

159
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,320
Roshni...

160
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,260
Roshni!
-Get her down! Get down! Qutbuddin!

161
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:11,060
Hammer some sense into her! Qutbuddin...
-What are you doing? Zulaikha! Get down!

162
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,850
What's that?
-Qutbuddin!
-Get down, Zulaikha!

163
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,853
Malika! Aliya! Roshni! Mehek! Come here!

164
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:23,690
Aunt!
-Mum!
-Get down!
-What are you thinking?
-Back off! Geroff me!

165
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,370
Aunt!
-Mum!
-Stay away!

166
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:32,210
Go away!
-Please, Mum...
-Aunt...
-What the devil is going on?

167
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:40,768
What do you think you're doing?
-I know you're here to order me to forget my humiliation and let that bloody maid stay!

168
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:43,940
Over my dead body!

169
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,440
No, Mum!
-Please, Aunt...

170
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay! She's not coming back! Happy?

171
00:18:50,360 --> 00:19:02,850
Please, Mum... Get down... Here...

172
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,050
Mehek!

173
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,420
Call the doctor! Qutbuddin!
-Right!

174
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,310
Mehek!

175
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:12,060
Open your eyes!
-Mehek?

176
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,942
Mehek! Open your eyes!

177
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:19,000
What happened?
-Water... Get some water...

178
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,948
Mehek...

179
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:42,321
I thought about it while you were away.

180
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,378
What?

181
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,140
Which of the money and my humiliation do I care about more.

182
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,958
Which one is it?
-I'm not going back.

183
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,900
Your sister's getting married. You've got to give them 600,000 by tomorrow.

184
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,979
No problem if it took another day...

185
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm sure this lad's worth two million. At the very least.

186
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:14,540
Many childless couples are looking for a way to kill their loneliness...

187
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,493
I know just where to sell him for a proper fortune.

188
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,840
That it?

189
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:30,140
Not even spare change if you ask me.
-300,000 for now...

190
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:38,200
<i>No one</i> gives an advance that big when you've struck a deal for 600 grand in 60 days, my dear Guddi!

191
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,191
Oooh...

192
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:45,411
If it isn't the wily fox peeking from behind that innocent face!

193
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,478
600 bags right now...

194
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:53,018
Plus 400 for the humiliation.

195
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,950
That makes one million.

196
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,829
Deal.

197
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,930
300K right now...

198
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,970
300 on your sister's wedding...

199
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,580
And 400 after 58 days.

200
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,120
I need a moment to think.

201
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,570
How's she, doctor?

202
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,385
Her blood pressure dropped quite alarmingly...

203
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:46,970
Her life was at risk, but don't worry... I've given her a shot. She should be fine now.

204
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,702
Please make sure she doesn't get stressed out.

205
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:56,768
Thank you very much, doctor.

206
00:21:56,768 --> 00:22:00,970
Get him to his car, Munna.
-Sure.

207
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,691
Good night.
-Good night.

208
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,721
Mehek...

209
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,240
Had a row or something?
-Why do you ask?

210
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,386
Just... Asking?

211
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,750
And how's your master?

212
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,800
Worse.

213
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,930
It'll take time...

214
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,520
But he'll be better...

215
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,058
And how's the lady?

216
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:30,758
Fine.

217
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,083
Alright. Give her my regards.

218
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:44,840
I'm sure the pain is crippling...

219
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:52,260
But if you give up, you'll be here all your life like me...

220
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,675
She'll think you two-timed her and become someone else's.

221
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,329
Never.

222
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,670
You can't help it.

223
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,217
What's the best you can do?

224
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:16,462
Bang your head against the bars, the walls? Kill yourself?

225
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,151
There's nothing you can do.

226
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:23,230
She's like a sister!

227
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,960
<i>Like</i> a sister, yes...

228
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,436
Not really a sister...

229
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:34,696
Marrying her can be your way out.

230
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:40,974
It's a bitter pill you have to swallow if you want to get to your wife.

231
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,216
I can see you want me to be mean...

232
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,967
You want me to ruin her life to break free! She's just a kid!

233
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:57,933
Look...

234
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:11,050
Asher Khan thinks after he acts.

235
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:19,340
If he wants you married to his daughter, then so it will be!

236
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,777
And if not, he'd much rather keep his daughter with him as a lonely spinster...

237
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:29,964
Don't be so cruel to yourself... Or your wife!

238
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:40,962
Every restless twitch, every teardrop, every sigh of hers weighs a ton on you!

239
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:46,518
Every rustle gives her hope that you're back...

240
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,220
You've got this chance...

241
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,940
Think about yourself... And her...

242
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,820
This is no sin...

243
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,289
It's the road to freedom.

244
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,097
It's up to you.

245
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,725
It's up to you, mate...

246
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,431
You wanted to talk to me, Grandpa?

247
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:39,000
I heard you want to be a politician?

248
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,290
Not just! The Prime Minister, no less!

249
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:48,218
Hardly different. You got to start somewhere.

250
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:53,278
The village council has an election in three months.

251
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:55,878
Three villages will be voting.

252
00:25:55,878 --> 00:26:03,410
I thought I should put you up for election this time.
-Please, don't just think. Decide and tell me anytime in the next three months!

253
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:08,180
You can't just charm the public like that.

254
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:15,660
You haven't heard me speak. But the mirror in my room has. I address a rally before it everyday.

255
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,790
I bet it would give me a standing ovation if it had hands and legs!

256
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:28,964
Alright... But there's a test. I'll put you up for election if you do well.

257
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:31,219
Aye aye, sir! Where's the strike?

258
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:34,180
Monsieur!

259
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,230
Mehek's come to!

260
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,868
Deo gratias...

261
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:44,048
She's just saying, 'Don't let Guddi go'...

262
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:45,890
Okay. Go.

263
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,562
Sir.

264
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:58,501
Well, Qutbuddin... I want you to convince your sister to let Guddi come back.

265
00:26:58,501 --> 00:26:59,852
Ain't easy.

266
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:10,010
You're practically asking a winning candidate to surrender before his weak rival the night before the polls!

267
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,310
It wouldn't be a test if it weren't tough.

268
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:19,500
Promise me you're putting me up for election if I succeed?

269
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,560
Promise.

270
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,968
Go.

271
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,140
I've never had a moment's peace after you...

272
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:52,980
If only I had one chance... To tell you... Why I'm not back... That I'm not two-timing you... That I'm incarcerated and helpless...

273
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:02,720
You've brought me on my knees... I can't take a stand for anything...

274
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:15,253
The sweet redolence of your tresses... The feeling of you eyeing your love... The memories are still green...

275
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,835
Green...

276
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,180
These memories keep me going...

277
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,340
I've grown weary of waiting...

278
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,470
Too tired to go on...

279
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:41,800
Please... Hear me still thinking of you... And come back...

280
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,170
Before grief claims my life...

281
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,422
Come back...

282
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,110
Don't be so cruel to yourself... Or your wife!

283
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:12,850
Every restless twitch, every teardrop, every sigh of hers weighs a ton on you!

284
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,506
Every rustle gives her hope that you're back...

285
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,100
You've got this chance...

286
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,800
Think about yourself... And her...

287
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,710
This is no sin...

288
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,335
It's the road to freedom.

289
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,048
I talked to Mehek an hour ago.

290
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,720
She said Grandpa's back.

291
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,697
I'm surprised she didn't call again.

292
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,651
She's not answering...

293
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,720
Do you think I'm waiting for her?

294
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,319
Aren't you?

295
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,595
I can't take my eyes off the rails. I'm waiting for the train...

296
00:31:11,595 --> 00:31:14,119
You just struck a deal with me!

297
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm giving you one million!

298
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,976
I'm sorry, I teeter a lot! Didn't I tell you?

299
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,420
Know why?

300
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,382
Lady Luck is as adamant as you are. Be too sure and things never change for you.

301
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:34,821
You gotta shilly-shally sometimes to have it your way, you do!

302
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:39,950
Did you think I'd give up this fortune worth two million in two minutes?

303
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:47,483
One million for 60 days of insult... Not on your nelly, guv!

304
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,080
Excuse me! Where's the train?
-On its way...

305
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,642
Is it?

306
00:31:57,172 --> 00:31:59,490
Okay... Have my number.

307
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,522
Do drop by if you come to Karachi.

308
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:06,170
I'm very different from this stone broke state, I assure you!

309
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:13,254
Fancy a taste of Manna and Quail? Come over sometime. Bet you won't feel like going back.

310
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:32,455
I'm gonna smash this jug into your head so hard it's gonna shatter like the jug!

311
00:32:32,455 --> 00:32:37,162
How dare you ask me to change my decision?

312
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm not asking you... I'm just negotiating... Making peace. You're free to refuse. But I'm sure if you made peace, you'd find some small measure of it yourself.

313
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,170
Go against my ego? It only troubles me more!

314
00:32:53,170 --> 00:33:02,750
It's no good sitting in the Parliament all by yourself, is it? Seeing a parliament without the Opposition is like... Being thirsty but getting no water!

315
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,280
Get straight to your guff, I don't want a blimmin' news bulletin!

316
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,360
You made her homeless in a second!

317
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,500
It doesn't suit her, does it? Certainly, not <i>just</i> that! No... Bring her back. Insult her everyday.

318
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,656
Beat her with a different boot everyday.

319
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:24,410
Find peace everyday. Oh, lovely!

320
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,533
I'm sure you'll love it too!

321
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,200
Go and ask Dad to call her back.

322
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,326
I'm fine with it.

323
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,723
Okay.

324
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,290
Quickly. We're just stopping for five minutes.
-Okay.

325
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,402
Hush, now!

326
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:23,771
Please don't do that. That's someone's life you're holding in your hands.

327
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,311
Fair enough. What about my insult?

328
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,644
I'm in for more of the same if I go back.

329
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:34,530
Aye, I've never done anything respectable. That doesn't mean I don't care about being respected.

330
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,087
Guddi!

331
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,921
I let Guddi take my son!

332
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:45,232
What could I do? Tell Aunt he's my son?

333
00:34:45,232 --> 00:34:48,950
What could I tell her about his father?

334
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:56,368
I don't care about my life... It's my son --
-Mehek?

335
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,865
Come in.

336
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,020
Mehek...

337
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,702
Don't worry.

338
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,730
Bring that smile back.

339
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,104
What?

340
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:25,792
She said she'll let Guddi come back.

341
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,179
Really?
-Yeah.

342
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:29,924
Yeah.

343
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,190
Thank you so much.

344
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,094
Anytime.

345
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,165
My phone...

346
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,402
For God's sake, Guddi...

347
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:52,844
Don't leave. It may kill someone.

348
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:58,160
Felt nice when you...

349
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,440
Held my hand so gently...

350
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,664
I thought I'd stay for a while.

351
00:36:08,932 --> 00:36:22,259
If I felt you're anything but this gentle, I'd scream so loud all the men would rush to help.

352
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:29,094
Men love to help a lonely girl, they do! Who doesn't want to be a poor lady's knight in shining armour!

353
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:31,110
Leave me alone!

354
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:36,090
He botherin' you, ma'am?
-Na, thank you... Nothin' of the sort...

355
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,990
Yet... See that? One knight errant!

356
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:45,340
The louder I scream, the larger their horde will grow...

357
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,337
So... Get off me!

358
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,562
To the devil with you! Just -- Give him to me!

359
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:01,230
Give you my fortune worth two million in exchange for all the insult? Oh, please! Out of my way!

360
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,581
Guddi!

361
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:04,170
Guddi!

362
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,747
Gu --

363
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,710
Hello?
-Adam?

364
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:17,040
The Lord heard my prayers... Bring Guddi and my son back. Quick.

365
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,054
I'm longing to see my son...

366
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:25,060
Adam? Why don't you say anything?

367
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,000
Hello?

368
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,480

369
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't -- Don't tell me you let her go!
