1
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,334
I know what you're thinking...

2
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,230
Hmm...

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,758
Mehek's suffering pains me.

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,090
She didn't deserve this... Any of this...

5
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,850
It pains me too...

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,095
But her fault...

7
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:50,214
Did you just say it's her fault she fell in love?

8
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:51,419
No.

9
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:57,366
But forgetting everyone else's love in your love... That's a different story...

10
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:00,316
I won't say it's her fault now though...

11
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:04,064
She's suffered long enough...

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:09,831
It'd be too cruel to bring it up every now and then.

13
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,897
But don't worry.

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,783
I'll be right by her.

15
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,941
Thank you.

16
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,450
Home.

17
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,632
Nos da...

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,736
I'll wait until you go in...

19
00:01:54,736 --> 00:01:56,267
The lunchbox?

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,270
Adam...
-Yeah?

21
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,473
This is hardly new...

22
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:15,463
Like those who came before...

23
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:19,807
We love to wound ourselves in love.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,288
Na, Mr Adam...

25
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,890
Love is the elixir that can dress all wounds.

26
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,525
Hello?

27
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,568
You still up?

28
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:46,042
Just trying to sleep.

29
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,598
Alright?

30
00:04:50,735 --> 00:04:54,254
Do I need a reason to call you?

31
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,991
C'mon, now, mate... What is it?

32
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,176
Hello?

33
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,557
H -- ?

34
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,879
I salute your greatness.

35
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,034
You've been kind.

36
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,120
Helped me...

37
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,470
But most of all... I salute the Venus in you.

38
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,610
You don't need to thank me. The Lord God wanted you back on your feet. I just happened to be His agent...

39
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,969
Few people are kind of late...

40
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:55,890
Why don't you want to be one of them?

41
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,093
Be proud...

42
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,140
Look yourself in the mirror and clap for yourself.

43
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,330
No, thanks... I'm happy that you're fine now.

44
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,370
Oh, that lovely face deserves <i>so</i> much more...

45
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,920
Ever take a good look at yourself?

46
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,290
Eyes as enchanting as yours aren't found outside magazine covers...

47
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,686
And tresses that could ensnare the mightiest of kings...

48
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,437
I swear...

49
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,050
The pill's barely tried...

50
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,260
I'm back on my feet thanks to your beauty...

51
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:48,635
Please -- Don't say that... It feels so awkward...

52
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:53,690
Please... Leave... It'll be trouble if anyone saw you.

53
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,472
How well d'you know yourself?

54
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,044
You're a bit of what's troubling me right now.

55
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,987
Anyway, who'd come here?

56
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:13,540
My treacherous wife?

57
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,985
Who killed my repentance with her deceit?

58
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,675
I'll make her pay for it...

59
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:27,150
I'll give her a taste of Hell...

60
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,201
Right here...

61
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,750
She'd be flailing to catch her thoughts...

62
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,290
But it'd be too late...

63
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,420
By the time she's got a grip on it!

64
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:48,380
And the doctor...

65
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,370
Who makes money listening to broken hearts...

66
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,381
That Romeo's heart shall beat its last tonight...

67
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,001
He won't wake up to see the light of day.

68
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,550
For God's sake... Can we talk about it tomorrow? Please... Leave...

69
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,872
Put them on...

70
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,663
I'll take a good look at them for a minute... And leave.

71
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:40,803
It feels so awkward... Go!

72
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,221
Okay then...

73
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,138
I'll wait here.

74
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,409
There.

75
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:57,930
There. Go.

76
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,934
I got to sort it out today...

77
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:28,055
My love cannot take it any longer...

78
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,769
Come in.

79
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,728
Still up?

80
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,357
I dozed off for a while...

81
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,429
My mind was up all night though.
-What were you thinking?

82
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,885
Decided something...

83
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,790
What?

84
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,946
I want a divorce.

85
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,808
I want to break free.

86
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,400
Think again.

87
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:24,072
I've thought a hundred times.

88
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:31,999
I'm telling Adam...

89
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:36,055
To send him the divorce papers...

90
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,355
He'd be starving...

91
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,790
Want me to get something?

92
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,595
I want him here in three days.

93
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,655
Get it?
-Sir.

94
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:33,266
Go.

95
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,168
Aren't we ready yet?

96
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,900
For?

97
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,318
You forgot it...

98
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:49,628
What?

99
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,460
It's your daughter's wedding reception...

100
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,640
Never thought I'd see no preparations...

101
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,910
Never thought you'd be thundering the next morning!

102
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:18,279
Giving you my daughter doesn't weaken me.

103
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,990
You don't see it, do you?

104
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,940
Fathers lose their authority to their sons-in-law.

105
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,439
That's how it is...

106
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,350
She's a widow if he dies.

107
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,872
And not much different if she's divorced.

108
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,210
You're weak... Yeah, you are now...

109
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,059
You?

110
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,936
You're fine?

111
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,476
Back on your feet?

112
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,407
Am I dreamin -- ?

113
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,695
Reality check!

114
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,223
Yeah...

115
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,629
Now, tell me...

116
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,698
Do you remember your place?

117
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:12,481
Before I married your sister, your biggest dream used to be getting that one slice of bread for dinner...

118
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:18,261
The day you could get yourself some tea...

119
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,758
Was a feast for you...

120
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:32,569
May I know why -- You're reminding me?
-The same fate awaits you with open arms.

121
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,119
We're visiting our estate.

122
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:39,860
Come. Last time you're riding a car.

123
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,639
Quick!

124
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,380
Adam!

125
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,041
What is it?

126
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,948
Why didn't you take my call?

127
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,178
Put it on silent at night...

128
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:15,032
Why'd you call me?

129
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,402
Everything alright?

130
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:23,173
Mehek wants to see you... She's crying all day and sobbing all night... Doesn't say a word!

131
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:25,809
Come.
-Wait.

132
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,884
Go, Munna.

133
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:33,940
Got to go, Mum... Something came up...

134
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,440
Not more important than me, yes?

135
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,378
Go. I'm coming.

136
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,939
Yeah?

137
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:54,194
What was that last night?

138
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,930
I couldn't sleep all night!

139
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,010
I tried to ask you...

140
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,178
But shock and disappointment held me back.

141
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,647
What's your game?

142
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,054
It's no game, Mum...

143
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,580
I'll tell you everything.

144
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,010
Just think...

145
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,730
What if I kicked you and your sister out of my place?

146
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,018
How'd it feel?

147
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,558
What?

148
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,911
Awful...

149
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,571
I'd --

150
00:18:40,571 --> 00:18:42,801
I'd die...

151
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,492
Would you do as I say?

152
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:50,965
Of course... Because -- Why not?

153
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:58,780
Run in front of the car until we get there...

154
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,377
Don't slow down, okay?

155
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:05,467
I need to get back before your sister gets up.

156
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,217
What?

157
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:08,252
Go.

158
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:10,882
Get to it. C'mon.

159
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,900
We haven't got all day!

160
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,788
C'mon!

161
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,518
Faster!

162
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,197
Faster!

163
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,857
C'mon!

164
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,030
Run for your life!

165
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,580
Don't stop!

166
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,890
Yeah!

167
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,380
Just like that!

168
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,808
Yeah!

169
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,668
Get up! Quick! Back to it!

170
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,838
You in there?

171
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,478
Hello?

172
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,180
Now where'd he go?

173
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,268
You lied to us...

174
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,478
I know...

175
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,048
I shouldn't have lied... It's sinful...

176
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:21,628
But sometimes... Just to help someone out...

177
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,849
What could I do?

178
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,680
I just tried to lend a hand. Stand by her.

179
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,530
You deceived all of us...

180
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,680
And got engaged to a married woman!

181
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Not before I deceived myself...

182
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,740
Tricked myself into believing this illusion...

183
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,088
Yeah?

184
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,569
He's back on his feet!

185
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:44,759
And I'm disgraced in my own eyes...

186
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:49,940
I saved my body...

187
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,311
But not my heart...

188
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:55,051
What?

189
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,410
I don't know.

190
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,020
I don't want to know.

191
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,960
Don't call me again...

192
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,561
I need time to get a grip on myself.

193
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:27,820
I don't blame you...

194
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,730
But that doesn't mean...

195
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,886
I can say you're right... Just because you're my son...

196
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:41,900
I won't stop you from helping Mehek...

197
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,210
But... You and Guddi... Together at night...

198
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,957
What d'you have to say about that?
-Just the truth, Mum.

199
00:23:54,957 --> 00:23:58,687
I swear I won't hide anything.

200
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,307
I won't.

201
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,757
Wa --

202
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,950
Water...

203
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,947
Feelin' the heat, eh?

204
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,828
Here...

205
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,371
Water... My throat's drying up! Get me some water!

206
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:40,311
H -- Here... Wh -- What are you doing? Blimey! Get away!

207
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,068
What are you doing?

208
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:46,990
I've come this far on this thorny road barefoot. It is time you tasted the blood on my feet!

209
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,289
What do you mean?

210
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,710
My helplessness!

211
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,882
Want water?

212
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:57,262
Eh?

213
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,910
Here. Drink all you want! Here! Want some more?

214
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,190
Shut up and get back to it!

215
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,788
C'mon!

216
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,100
Faster!

217
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,508
Everyone's got their carefully-guarded painful secrets...

218
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:54,189
Guddi...

219
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:55,981
So helpless?

220
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:57,972
Please, Mum...

221
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,920
I was helpless before her helplessness...

222
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,960
Or is it that you've grown to like her?

223
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,940
I've grown to respect her...

224
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,650
Respect her feelings, maybe...

225
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,848
Started respecting her... Yeah...

226
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,279
May I come in, Mehek?

227
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,094
Yeah.

228
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,878
Shahmir's not sleeping, is he?

229
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:43,140
No. He's up.

230
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,449
May I?

231
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:48,068
Sure. Here.

232
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,984
In the Lord's name. Careful.

233
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,328
Shahmir! How are you?

234
00:26:56,328 --> 00:27:00,578
Know what, I've missed you so much!

235
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:07,730
In a few years... I'll be older than this... And I'll take you to school...

236
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:13,960
No one will bother you there... By the way, you should try the wraps someday...

237
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,580
I'll give you a ride on my shoulders in the break! How d'you like that?

238
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,270
And... Don't... Miss... Your Dad, okay?

239
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:33,360
It never makes any difference... I missed my Dad a lot too... It didn't bring him back...

240
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,030
What happened? Was it something I said?

241
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,154
I was just talking to Shahmir...

242
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,008
No.

243
00:27:56,588 --> 00:28:01,719
You don't know it, but you said in your innocence a truth I could not...

244
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,030
I don't get it...

245
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,170
Missing someone...

246
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:15,250
Doesn't really matter to them...

247
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,601
And it sure doesn't bring them back...

248
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,360
I've decided something...

249
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,110
But I can't let Grandpa know...

250
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,280
May I ask you?

251
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,730
But I'm just a kid... What'd I tell you?

252
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,654
Everyone shuts me up... Says I'm too young...

253
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:41,910
Please, Munna...

254
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,541
O -- Okay, Mehek... Go on...

255
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,913
I've decided to leave his father...

256
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,930
Am I doing the right thing?

257
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,209
What do I say?

258
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,571
Whatever's on your mind...

259
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,578
Whatever feels right...

260
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,470
Just... Say it...

261
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:18,011
What can you leave someone who was never with you?

262
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,640
I knew...

263
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,868
You'd help me out...

264
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,898
Thank you.

265
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,408
Thank you...

266
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,418
Thank you...

267
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,266
You're crying?

268
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,100
D'you think I should be laughing?

269
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,658
Yeah?

270
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,548
Your happiness is all I've ever prayed for...

271
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:13,950
Wipe those tears and tell me why.

272
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,948
I heard everything you told Mum...

273
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,091
It breaks your heart completely, doesn't it?

274
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Hearts don't beak completely or in bits, Guria...

275
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,462
They break...

276
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:36,752
Or they don't...

277
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,138
Saqib!

278
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,056
Saqib!

279
00:31:27,056 --> 00:31:29,487
You're back? Come here!

280
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,992
Check out this new drama on the telly...

281
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,922
You got to watch this with me! C'mon!

282
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,540
Saqib!

283
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,068
Saqib!

284
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:56,028
I've been making this for an hour... Don't leave before you've had it, okay? C'mon, sit!

285
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,801
I'll be going to work from tomorrow...

286
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:06,380
But don't worry, I'll leave your breakfast in a hot pot.

287
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:13,460
This tea's steaming right now, by the way... You don't want to have it any later than right now!

288
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,898
Quick!

289
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,518
Where's Rahim?

290
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,818
On his way...
-Rahim!

291
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:02,968
Where are you? Come here already!

292
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,678
Enough of your smarts.

293
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:21,490
Time to pay back every penny you've made off my father's kindness...

294
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,637
It's a weight you cannot carry anymore.

295
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,020
It's a weight...

296
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,291
I won't let you carry anymore...

297
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:41,000
For it may break your backs!

298
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,570
Now bugger off! All of you! I want you here at 6.

299
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,958
Looks like the Lord's happy I've changed...

300
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:46,210
Looks like my prayers were just waiting for me to put this bitterness behind me to be answered.

301
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,441
But this time... I didn't even have to finish... Didn't even have to say 'Amen'...

302
00:34:52,441 --> 00:34:54,752
To be heard...

303
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,307
Amen!

304
00:34:58,058 --> 00:34:59,998
Congratulations.

305
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,570
Won't you ask what I was praying for?

306
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,820
I'm just happy that you're happy.

307
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,090
It's what I care about the most.

308
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:16,160
And if I said I'd be glad to tell you?

309
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,890
Well, then... Tell me why... In the Lord's name...

310
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,030
Oh...

311
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,970
Don't make it difficult for me...

312
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,270
There's just one reason...

313
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:36,240
But telling you, standing right here... I could make up 99 more...

314
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,670
Yeah?

315
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,190
I opened the door, thinking...

316
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,790
It's too empty... To quiet... Too lonely...

317
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,737
I prayed...

318
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:52,777
That you show up 'round the corner...

319
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,520
And...

320
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,350
I didn't even say 'grace this scene' when you showed up.

321
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:03,920
Encore, my Lord!

322
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,768
Amen!

323
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,700
May the Lord do whatever's best for you.

324
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,197
Hey, Adam!
-Hey.

325
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,630
And here's a gentle reminder that I should've said 'Amen'!

326
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,459
Where's Mehek?

327
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:33,980
Waiting for you. She's asked me so many times and I've told her every time you're on your way... Just came here to check...

328
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,610
Okay. Tell her I'm here.
-Okay.

329
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,710
Would you like some tea?

330
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,384
No, thank you.

331
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,790
You know I'd like some tea right now too...

332
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay... Two cuppas, please!

333
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
