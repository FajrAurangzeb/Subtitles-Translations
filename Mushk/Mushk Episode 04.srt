1
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,345
Thought you could get away with it, eh?

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,308
Hello? Yeah, Mam?

3
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:09,798
Hello. It's been a month since you talked to me. How are you?

4
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:12,140
I'll get back later.
-Wait...

5
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,130
Don't hang up...

6
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:18,614
Who knows when I'll get to talk to you again.

7
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:20,115
Yeah?

8
00:01:20,115 --> 00:01:23,802
You asked me to get Chutki married...

9
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:28,770
And told me you'd send me some money in a few days.

10
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,182
Her wedding's in five days. I've got to give an advance for the jewellery and furniture tomorrow.

11
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:38,152
And the caterer's asking for two hundred thousand!

12
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:45,760
I prayed that I don't have to ask you...

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,180
But I'm out of time... I couldn't help it. Your Tad's worried too.

14
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,752
Did he say something?

15
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:56,625
No.

16
00:01:56,985 --> 00:02:01,590
But he didn't have anything since yesterday. Just half a cup of tea.

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,423
That's how I know. The worry's starving him.

18
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:08,954
I hope you didn't tell him I said I'll send money.

19
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:15,328
You off your head? He'd kick me out if I said that!

20
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:19,120
I told him your Uncle's helping.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,611
Just pray for me... I'll do something.
-What do you mean?

22
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,430
Don't you have anything right now? When will you get it?
-I told you, I'll do something. I'll get back to you.

23
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,178
Okay... But... You've only got today...

24
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,976
Help us, O Lord...

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,103
How are you related to Malik Nureddin?

26
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:58,112
He's my Grandpa.

27
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,595
Please, take a seat.

28
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,438
Sit!

29
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,263
He's such an upright man. A saint!

30
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:30,029
Didn't you think about him for a moment?

31
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:34,500
Do you know him?

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,150
He's been very kind to me.

33
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,050
He's the kind who guards the honour of others... And you!

34
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,373
Please, I beg you... Don't tell him anything. Please...

35
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,153
Okay.

36
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:05,755
But promise me you won't stain his honour again.

37
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:10,568
Promise me it won't happen again.

38
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:15,724
I promise. Never again. I'm so sorry this happened...

39
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,060
You'd let Saqib go, won't you?

40
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,014
It's not his fault...

41
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,631
It's been 35 minutes. I won't wait a minute more.

42
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,480
Please don't leave Roshni here... I'm sure she's just gone to buy something...

43
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,945
I can't wait here. You're free to wait here.
-Please, Uncle... Just a few more minutes?

44
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:00,710
There!

45
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:03,663
Where were you?

46
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,981
I needed to get some books...
-Splendid... About time we got a move on.

47
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,100
Shahmir!

48
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,978
Munna!

49
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,664
Munna...

50
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:11,678
It's been 30 minutes! Go to the station, before my misfortune follows her there!

51
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:24,570
And... Here. Shahmir would be starving. Get him some milk, okay? Get something for Guddi too. Do whatever you must... Just... Don't let her go. Grandpa would be here any moment.

52
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,260
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

53
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,560
Quickly.
-Munna!

54
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,120
Remember your puny place here before you even think of doing anything like that!

55
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,435
Poke your nose where it doesn't belong and I'll chop it off.

56
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,606
Back to work!

57
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,330
Come with me.

58
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,691
You're staying here.

59
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,370
Sit!

60
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,859
For Thine is the kingdom,

61
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:25,270
And the power,

62
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,750
And the glory, for ever. Amen.

63
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,469
Excuse me...

64
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:47,470
It's still four hours before the train gets here.

65
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,400
If it's on time, that is!

66
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,269
If things go as usual, you're five or six hours early, if not more.

67
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:02,081
Why?

68
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,770
Why?

69
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,830
Got a problem?

70
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,920
Is it illegal to wait that long? They gonna flog me?

71
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,610
Be my guest.
-Of course not... You don't get it...

72
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:24,213
I just meant... The kid's on the bench. The hard bench. It'd hurt him.

73
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,587
D'you think he'd be quiet if it hurt him?

74
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:30,610
It's comfortable enough for him.

75
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,065
Nah, you don't quite get it...

76
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:42,070
Please... Don't start telling me... Not feeling myself. Dreadful day... For me, and for you if you don't shut up!

77
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,702
Okay... I get it...

78
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:51,260
I can totally hear your worry...

79
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,944
I don't mind anything... Just...

80
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:04,910
I'm 'round here. In case you, you know, need anything.

81
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:12,768
It is He who helps, but if I can be His instrument, it'd do me good too.

82
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,864
Salve, Regina, Mater misericordiæ...

83
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:51,685
If only you stopped doubting my capabilities... I swear, our world would be so different.

84
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,870
What do you mean?

85
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,263
I want to stand for election.

86
00:09:58,263 --> 00:10:04,903
I swear... The problems that ail this place will turn to dust.

87
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:10,654
Forget pits, you won't even see a pebble on the roads...

88
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:14,690
It'll save so much trouble on the roads...

89
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,424
Wait...

90
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,910
Hello?

91
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,980
Grandpa... Where are you? I've been calling you for so long.

92
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,496
Why are you crying?

93
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:30,917
Aunt beat Guddi badly and kicked her out!

94
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,121
But why?

95
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,522
Just... Come back...

96
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:39,950
Where'd she go with the wee child?

97
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,842
I'd be to blame for anything that happened to her...

98
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:48,499
She's out of her mind. Let me talk to her.

99
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:51,942
Okay...

100
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,270
Aunt... It's Grandpa. He wants to talk to you. Please open the door.

101
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,917
Don't!
-Aunt!

102
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,280
For God's sake, open the door!

103
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,070
Just talk to him!

104
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,107
Aunt...

105
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,000
She isn't opening the door, Grandpa. Not saying a word.

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,731
Don't worry.

107
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,330
I'll be back in the evening.

108
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,115
It'll be too late by then.

109
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:32,350
You'll have to wait a while...

110
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Open the door, Aunt! Please...

111
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,830
Aunt... Open the door...

112
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,770
Munna... Go and open the door.

113
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,620
Munna...

114
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,819
Open the door...

115
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,410
Good Heavens... What are you doing?

116
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,985
Everything alright?

117
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,740
Yeah.

118
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,310
Wait until we get back...

119
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:43,788
She's alone with the kid... She doesn't know this place, Aunt... Please... She was my responsibility...

120
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,320
Heavens, Zulaikha... Open the door!

121
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,370
Get up!

122
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:40,501
Hey... Getting ready at this awful parlour... You won't believe how hideous I look... The other parlour's really good, but expensive... Why don't you talk to Mum? She won't say no if you said it. Please, Gu --

123
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,500
Hmm... Should I call Mehek?

124
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,953
Not so fast...

125
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:50,420
She'll think I'm helpless.

126
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:57,530
Let her suffer with me. Suffer the pain of parting with your son. Taste an ounce of my pain at my humiliation!

127
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,855
If you ask me, you've done worse than murder.

128
00:14:22,855 --> 00:14:27,940
For you've murdered your family's honour.

129
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,141
For the love of God, Guddi...

130
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,423
For the love of God, Guddi... Don't punish my son for what my Aunt did to you.

131
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:14,942
Punish me, thwack me if you want... But please... Don't go...

132
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:24,960
Grandpa will be here any moment... I'll do something... Bring you back. I'll even give you the money if you want. But please, Guddi... Don't go anywhere...

133
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,429
Shahmir...

134
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,740
Your Tad's worried too.

135
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,673
You told me you'd send me some money in a few days.

136
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:44,899
Her wedding's in five days. I've got to give an advance for the jewellery and furniture tomorrow.

137
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:31,600
My Lord... It's a doddle for You... Will You?

138
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,430
When I open my eyes, may I see my Mehek --

139
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,000
When I open my eyes, may I see my Mehek --
-Adam!

140
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,990
Adam!

141
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,696
Thank You!
-Adam!

142
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,350
Adam... My...

143
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,594
My son...

144
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,790
Please save my son...

145
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,984
Please...

146
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,690
<i>Your</i> son?

147
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,234
Is it that she's not his mother...

148
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:41,401
Or not human?

149
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,871
Sir...

150
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:51,623
Excuse me, sir...

151
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,500
Could you get some milk for him?
-Of course.

152
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll be back now... In a moment...

153
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,137
Guddi's reckless when she's angry...

154
00:19:20,137 --> 00:19:24,887
Her anger kills every other emotion in her...

155
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:33,069
I'm so worried that she left Shahmir somewhere and --
-Guddi? Who's Guddi?

156
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:37,146
The girl who said she's here as my maid.

157
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:41,990
I lied to hide it from my family.

158
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,741
I told them Shahmir's her son.

159
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,351
Where'd you find her?

160
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,771
Karachi.

161
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:56,546
How long do you know her?

162
00:19:56,546 --> 00:19:59,028
Just four days...

163
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:03,082
Please... Save my son...

164
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:06,120
You're the only one who can help me...

165
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,008
You trusted a stranger with your life in just four days?

166
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,270
It takes the rest of us our lives to earn someone's trust!

167
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,471
What could I do?

168
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:22,534
I was out of options.

169
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:27,018
My visa expired. I had to come back!

170
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:31,344
I just got on my plane and came here without telling anyone.

171
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,829
I even got the train ticket back home.

172
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,543
Here.

173
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,942
Sir...

174
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,770
Ticket to Mir Adam, please.

175
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,166
That'll be 940.

176
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,940
Here.

177
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,928
Here's the change.

178
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,451
I started waiting for the train.

179
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,140
My mind was black. Paralysed.

180
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,153
It just thought itself to death...

181
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:18,484
The train stopped. Everyone was getting off... But my legs refused to support me.

182
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,610
It felt so... Suffocating...

183
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,320
As if I'd left my courage had abandoned me on the way...

184
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,479
I bought tickets, but my fear tore it.

185
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,960
I prayed for a way out all night.

186
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,949
I kept praying...

187
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,338
What happened?

188
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:02,183
You look so worried.

189
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,451
Everything alright?

190
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:12,875
I'm running away from some folks. Would you happen to have some spare clothes?

191
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:18,725
I don't think they'd recognise me if I put on a veil and sat with you.

192
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,420
It may save my life.

193
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,150
Wait.

194
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,280
Here.

195
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,500
Cover your face.

196
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,454
Thank you.

197
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,480
I was looking for help...

198
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,595
But when she asked for help, I couldn't refuse.

199
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:29,275
I would've cried for the walls to hear, if no one else... I felt so helpless...

200
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:34,898
She was much more... She was human. I told her everything.

201
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:40,270
She looked into my powerless eyes for some time, before saying...

202
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:50,663
Do as I told you. They'll think he's my son... And you'll have 60 days to look for his Tad.

203
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:05,790
Trust and honour are priceless. That's what my Tad said. That's what makes them so... Profitable. That's what I believe.

204
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,170
Surely, it's not dearer to you than 600 gee?

205
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,977
I'm helping you for half off today. Because you helped me.

206
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,397
I bought two tickets again...

207
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,187
The train left for here in the morning.

208
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,960
What've you done, Mehek?

209
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,037
Please...

210
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,950
Do anything you can... Just... Bring them back... I beg you.

211
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,334
Please... Don't...

212
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,724
Give me a moment to take everything you've told me...

213
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:53,529
It'll only hurt more if you beg me...

214
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:56,910
I'll do what I must.

215
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,965
For you.

216
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,923
And I promise I'll bring them back.

217
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,052
Easy.

218
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:19,311
Guards!

219
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,657
Guards!

220
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,099
Guards!
-Ma'am?

221
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,280
I told you to stop Mehek from getting to the station!

222
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,800
Why didn't you?

223
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,360
I haven't taken my eyes off her for a moment. She's just gone over to Mr Adam's.

224
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,710
'HavEn'T tAkEN mY eYEs ofF Her fOr a mOmENt'.

225
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,078
Useless idiot!

226
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,146
What are you doing here?

227
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,960
I thought I'd see Guria...

228
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,650
I know you inside out.

229
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,610
Always known you as Adam...

230
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,740
But it appears time has changed your name!

231
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,977
Guria, is it? Lovely...

232
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,584
Where are you off to?

233
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,094
Why?

234
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:29,520
I asked you why.

235
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,595
I want an answer. Not a question.

236
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:36,882
Mr Malik asked me to get some papers. May I?

237
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,917
That better be it.

238
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:51,590
I don't want you coming back with a wedge to drive between us forever. Get it?

239
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,240
Looks like he plans to kill us today...

240
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,010
He seems to have sent us our Last Supper!

241
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,322
Hello?

242
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:17,680
You there yet?

243
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,580
Yeah.

244
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,760
Don't tell me you don't see her around.

245
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,285
I think I see her...

246
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,820
Pink scarf. Holding a baby.
-Yeah... That's her!

247
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,879
Please... Don't let her go... Please stop her...

248
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:38,240
Okay.

249
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,910
Okay...

250
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,490
Thank God...

251
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,608
Got a problem?

252
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,360
Well -- I...

253
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,350
Aye, you what?

254
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:47,755
Lemme make it very clear to you. If you tried to paw me or ask for my number, I'm gonna smite you proper! Now bog off!

255
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,910
We need to talk.

256
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,611
Hmm...

257
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:59,270
'Need to talk', eh? Feel like coming on to a poor little lonely girl, eh?

258
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,870
God damn your 'talk' to hell!

259
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,630
God damn your 'talk' to hell!
-Mehek sent me!

260
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,399
Mehek sent me!

261
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:11,317
Mehek sent me here...

262
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,910
Please... Enjoy the meal.

263
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,250
I don't feel hungry.

264
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,396
But I am...

265
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,905
Bimey, my tongue hasn't tasted this fortune in ages!

266
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,501
I'd rather not turn down His gifts...

267
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,071
I wonder why you're being so kind...

268
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,689
He's my nephew.

269
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,108
Oh...

270
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:46,783
So... It appears you don't even spare family...

271
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:48,731
Can it!

272
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,156
Give me a moment...

273
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:58,570
I'll take anything you throw at me after I'm finished...

274
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:17,218
I can see the true purpose of this feast peeking from behind the curtain of care...

275
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,823
Go on... What do you want?

276
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,109
Tell him...

277
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:37,030
He thinks I've got some pity left for him in my heart that will come out some day...

278
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,703
Tell him he's waiting for the impossible.

279
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:46,550
Your ruthlessness is as clear as the day...

280
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,543
I don't need to tell him...

281
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:58,280
Look into my ageing eyes...

282
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,289
They bear witness to your tyranny.

283
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:11,730
Look at my unkempt beard, my scruffy hair...

284
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,585
No words can speak more clearly...

285
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,190
Don't start with me.

286
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:24,672
Tell him.

287
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,840
Tell him he better...

288
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,300
Get married to my daughter.

289
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,909
But --

290
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,781
She'd be barely 13!

291
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,551
Aye...

292
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,843
How do I know...

293
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,032
It's been 14 years...

294
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:21,490
I've been in here 14 years...

295
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,000
Take it away. They're not getting anything for three days.

296
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
