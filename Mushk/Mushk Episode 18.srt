1
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,852
Adam!

2
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,220
Want me to get breakfast?

3
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,656
Come here...

4
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,479
I've made you cry buckets for some of these, haven't I?

5
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,470
No way... It's nothing like that...

6
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,813
I was just a kid...

7
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,619
Of course...

8
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,314
You wanted to keep this shawl, remember?

9
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,960
I'd turned you down.

10
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,635
You cried all night...

11
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:34,359
I cried a bit when I saw you too...

12
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,465
But I could never give my sister what I'd got for Mehek...

13
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,501
And... These bangles...

14
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:58,810
You wanted them the moment you'd seen them...

15
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,315
But I couldn't give them to you even though I wanted to...

16
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,980
Never had the courage...

17
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,325
Why don't you keep them, Guria?

18
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,649
And this...

19
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,523
All of this... I'm sorry...

20
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:25,086
No way, mate... They're Mehek's!

21
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,669
Mehek's not in a position to keep them, Guria...

22
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,138
What are you saying?

23
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,895
She wants something else...

24
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,779
What?

25
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,650
I've found what she wants...

26
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,031
I've just got to give it to her.

27
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,762
See you...

28
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,850
Take care...

29
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,094
What's up?
-What a delightful day!

30
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:34,880
I don't get it?

31
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,724
Forgotten happiness entirely, have you? Lemme explain it...

32
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:43,748
It's a great fiend they all waste their whole lives seeking...

33
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:47,463
But only few ever get a lasting taste of it...

34
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:53,747
They'd kill and be killed for it... And it's what makes everyone forget about poor old grief...

35
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:58,662
Although grief is far more devoted... Always by your side...

36
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:04,898
Happiness can be a tad high-headed... You don't get it so easily.

37
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:11,061
And seeing you end your wait for Godot makes me so happy...

38
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:14,410
What'd you tell Grandpa?

39
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,522
I said one of my old friends is getting married, and I got to be there...

40
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,177
I'll be back in two days and I'm taking Guddi with me.

41
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:29,216
I thought he'd refuse...

42
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:34,321
But he nodded the moment I said I'll be with Adam.

43
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,570
I pray it's the last lie you ever tell anyone!

44
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,985
Mehek!

45
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,810
We'll see Shahmir again, right?

46
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,786
Can't say.

47
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,469
Like... Sometime?

48
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:53,731
Here we go again...

49
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,103
Can't say.

50
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,209
May I play with him?

51
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,151
Sure.

52
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,840
Is Mehek ready?

53
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,350
She's been ready for ages...

54
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,172
Just looking for her exit.

55
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,480
Okay, I'll be waiting in the car...
-Wait.

56
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,534
For God's sake, Guddi...

57
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,132
Don't say anything today.

58
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,197
I'm not sure I can take it.

59
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,344
My breaths sound like noise I need to shut out...

60
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,740
Been crying, of late?

61
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,413
No.

62
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,388
Ie.

63
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:15,445
Those eyes ain't red from a vigil.

64
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:18,240
I can see everything...

65
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,293
I can see how you pressured your mind, your heart...

66
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:24,101
And how your eyes narrowed...

67
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:27,290
Before they rained for hours.

68
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,838
I don't like to see it.

69
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,435
It almost pains me...

70
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,605
We gotta go...

71
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,606
Not us...

72
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,425
Just you...

73
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,195
Give him here...

74
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,355
I'll get her things in the car...

75
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,325
Hey...

76
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:19,459
May I hold him one last time?

77
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,486
Sure.

78
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,428
Shahmir...

79
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:28,726
Don't worry, okay?

80
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:32,417
Don't cry... Take care...

81
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,810
You knew it, Munna?

82
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,802
No...

83
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,957
Easy...

84
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,796
Easy there...

85
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,165
I'm here to thank you.

86
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:15,306
I've murdered my conscience.

87
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,830
Well, guess what, I've nothing to do with it...

88
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,084
And...

89
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:26,240
Nothing to do with you either, really...

90
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,524
And - as wicked as it sounds -

91
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:33,180
And - as wicked as it sounds - nothing to do with your sister either.

92
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,485
I'm just doing my duty as a good and loyal man...

93
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,325
So why waste your thanks?

94
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,533
I don't need it.

95
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:46,587
Keep it to yourself. Use it in the line of duty...

96
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,168
No.

97
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:50,950
You deserve it.

98
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,205
Thank you for pleasing Mr Khan like nothing else.

99
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:07,122
I could give you my heart if I could live with it.

100
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:13,883
Unfortunately, you'd have to make do with a thank you...

101
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,570
You seen Mum, Uncle Khawar?
-Aye, many times.

102
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,660
Please don't joke about it... Just -- Look at this... My gown's so loose!

103
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,296
Bless you.

104
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,160
She's so happy...

105
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,250
Looking forward to her wedding this evening!

106
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,407
I think it looks just fine...

107
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:36,723
I think it looks just fine... Shayan?

108
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,500
What d'you say?
-Yeah...

109
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,017
Too loose here... And too long!

110
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,162
Yeah? She's asking you.

111
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,697
Grandpa...

112
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,258
Take care...

113
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,289
Side-seat's mine!

114
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,590
I swear I ain't sayin' that to enjoy the ride or mock you...

115
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:06,430
What it is is sitting at the back makes me feel like there's only room for two...

116
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:11,126
I've worked so hard to make room for myself...

117
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,715
Ready?

118
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,199
Yeah.

119
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,610
Mr Khan...

120
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,193
Not a single guest...

121
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:45,544
What's with this... Boring wedding?

122
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,208
I've called a few witnesses...

123
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,590
What if Shayan...

124
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,839
God forbid... Refused?

125
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,254
The only way I can save myself from disgrace --
-Of course. I know what to do.

126
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,605
Take these pills for five days, and you'll be fine, okay?

127
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:17,430
Come back after five days...

128
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,623
Okay.

129
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:23,077
Just do as I say and you'll be fine.

130
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:25,909
Get the pills from out there.

131
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:39,180
Should I send the next one, Doc?

132
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,095
No... Not now...

133
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:44,233
In a moment...

134
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:47,510
Doctor's orders, I guess?

135
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,272
What's wrong with me?

136
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,745
I used to be a doctor...

137
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:19,342
How'd I get this affliction of the heart?

138
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,040
Shayan...

139
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,039
Come in.

140
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,190
There's...

141
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,205
Something I wanted to ask...

142
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:03,701
Mr Khan's been asking me to get you a gift...

143
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,795
My mind's stopped working...

144
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,539
I don't know what I should get you...

145
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,493
I thought...

146
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,489
I'd ask you...

147
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,445
What you'd want...

148
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:24,470
Could you curse me with all your heart?

149
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,084
With bitter spite?

150
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:33,870
Could you ask the Lord to curse me...

151
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,432
With death?

152
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,977
Life's too much for me to take...

153
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,981
I'm slipping...

154
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,591
If He listened to my prayers for death...

155
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:58,771
I wouldn't be here talking to you...

156
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,412
How long before we get there?

157
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:35,798
At this speed, four and a half hours. If we don't stop anywhere.

158
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:38,740
I've packed some things for you in the bag.

159
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,868
Topped up the petrol.

160
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,690
We won't have to stop anywhere...

161
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,357
Good Heavens... What was that?

162
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,080
I think the tyre burst...

163
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,913
Alas...

164
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,520
What happened?

165
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,366
Over there...

166
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,582
Yeah?

167
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,063
Guess where you'll end up fifteen minutes down that road?

168
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,949
Yeah?

169
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,035
My place...

170
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,112
Your Mum lives there?

171
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,998
Ie...

172
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,230
Want to see her?

173
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,153
Good day, Doc.

174
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,788
Good day...

175
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,673
Aye...

176
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,460
Where's everyone?

177
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,189
Who?

178
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:22,742
Everyone.

179
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:26,621
Grandpa's sleeping... Want me to wake him up?
-No...

180
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,140
And the others?

181
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:36,609
Roshni and Aliya are in the room with their Mum. Guddi and Mehek are on the way...

182
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,470
Where've they gone?
-Karachi.

183
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,763
But --

184
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:44,205
When?

185
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,980
And why?

186
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,257
I mean... When are they coming back?

187
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:53,151
They're going to a wedding... They'll be back in a few days.

188
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,811
Should I go tell Madame?
-No...

189
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:01,506
Get me a glass of water.
-Right away...

190
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,800
Would've been glad if you could tell me... Ease my waiting...

191
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,024
I can't rest now...

192
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:18,258
Got a few restless days ahead of me...
-Here.

193
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,914
Here...

194
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,360
Actually, never mind...

195
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,816
Ie...

196
00:19:34,816 --> 00:19:36,800
Right about here...

197
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,156
Want us to come with you?

198
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,784
Just you.

199
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,512
Wait here, Mehek...

200
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,297
I want to see my Mam... Find some peace in her embrace...

201
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,087
Mum... Wanted to ask something...

202
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,140
Sure... Go on...

203
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,744
Could we get my doll married to Ayesha's today too?

204
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,480
Bai fi yw e (It's me), Mam! Guddi!

205
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,923
Can it be?

206
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,209
Mam!

207
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,949
I hope no one saw you... Come!

208
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,463
Here!

209
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:18,037
Mam...
-Get in!

210
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,857
Why'd you have to come here?
-I'm here, Mam...

211
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,079
Okay, but why?

212
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,574
Do I need reasons to come home, now, Mam?

213
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:34,832
There's four complaints against you in the pentref!

214
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,558
They ain't gonna wait one moment before calling the plods!

215
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,260
Your Tad and I haven't slept in peace one night...

216
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,430
But seeing your Tad sleep peacefully three days ago...

217
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,120
I knew something was off...

218
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,419
Peace announces grief's visit here...

219
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,976
You callin' me grief, Mam?

220
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:08,334
Okay, mun, sori...

221
00:22:08,334 --> 00:22:11,631
But why'd you come here?

222
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,520
I just strolled right in... Can't help it when I miss you...

223
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,492
Can't think of the time or the place...

224
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:25,199
I don't ask myself why I'm missing you...

225
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,497
Your Tad's health is so unpredictable...

226
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,685
He's fine sometimes...

227
00:22:39,685 --> 00:22:42,543
And sick at others...

228
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,159
The doctor's asked him to stay away from stress and worry...

229
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,940
How's Tad?

230
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,334
He's been better for the last three days...

231
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:57,480
How's Chutki? Happy?

232
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,151
Yeah. Very...

233
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,630
And you, Mam?

234
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,030
I'll tell you everything on the phone... Don't wait 'round here. Go!

235
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,194
Won't you give me a kiss, Mam?

236
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,639
There. Quickly, now... Go...

237
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,833
I ain't even seen you yet!

238
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,114
I've missed you so much...

239
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:30,130
I swear I cry for hours before going to sleep...

240
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,158
I may drown but never stop missing you...

241
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,490
That's what you get...

242
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,631
For everything you've done...

243
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,317
I never did it for meself...

244
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,170
But for me own...

245
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,920
As if we asked you to smirch our names!

246
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:55,297
What could I do?

247
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,802
Remember when Chutki was kicked out of school for not paying her fees?

248
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,128
When Dad fell so ill...

249
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:10,984
But we couldn't even get him his pills?

250
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,202
I remember everything, Mam... Even what you do not...

251
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:21,064
Begging the neighbours for tea and sugar...

252
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,662
I never did any of it for me...

253
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,822
I never wanted anything, Mam...

254
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,260
I just did it for you... All of you...

255
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,220
So it is...

256
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,600
But we don't have time to talk.

257
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,766
Go... Quickly...

258
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,860
Mam...

259
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,582
C'mon, now...

260
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,800
Get going! Before someone saw you!

261
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:06,310
Ie... You wouldn't happen to have some money, would you? I need to get your Tad's pills...

262
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,229
Dad...

263
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:49,410
Get out of here... Just as you stepped out of the house...

264
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,371
Besmirching our names with your filthy footsteps!

265
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,946
I've come here to say sorry, Dad...

266
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,653
'Sorry'...

267
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:13,809
Did you listen to us?

268
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,956
Our honour fell at your feet and begged you as you stepped out...

269
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:25,190
Did you listen?

270
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,559
I couldn't think of anything...

271
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:38,304
My ill fortune held my hand and led me every step of the way...

272
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,825
Just... Do me a favour and get out of my room.

273
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:52,685
And do your best to make sure my eyes don't ever see your face again.

274
00:27:52,685 --> 00:27:54,875
Get out!
-Dad...

275
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,781
Out!

276
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,973
Here.

277
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,537
Have some.

278
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,468
Don't cry again, okay?

279
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:09,844
Ever...

280
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,604
Why are you crying?

281
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,134
You're missing that stinker again, aren't you?

282
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,470
No.

283
00:29:56,219 --> 00:30:00,906
Dad pulled me up and said he'd never want to see me again...

284
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:05,650
He won't even let me see his face again...

285
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,856
Easy there...

286
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,941
Not good. Come here...

287
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,281
Everything's gonna be alright... Go... I'm coming in a moment...

288
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,906
Hello?

289
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,190
Took you 125 calls to say hello!

290
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,933
I know...

291
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,604
I ought to say sorry...

292
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:13,328
Any half-decent man ought to say sorry as soon as he knows he's wrong.

293
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:22,070
But what about a man whose thoughts, intellect, reason, and sensibility have all called a strike?

294
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,460
What do you mean?

295
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:26,937
No idea...

296
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,298
No idea what's wrong with me...

297
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,530
Anyway...

298
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,833
Why'd you call me?

299
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,910
My husband's getting better...

300
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,769
Getting ready to get the better of us!

301
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,550
Order me...

302
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,601
Stop his breaths right now.

303
00:31:57,601 --> 00:32:01,297
He doesn't deserve one more...

304
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,781
Come in.

305
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,969
I don't need it.

306
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,533
But I do.

307
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,492
I'm giving you a piece of my heart...

308
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,640
The scent of these flowers will ease me.

309
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,195
Never thought those who hurt others could feel pain.

310
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,810
Your mother's death pains me...

311
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,355
That's why I'm fulfilling my promise to her.

312
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,130
Okay... Enough with the dolls getting married...

313
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:16,836
Gimme my doll back, Mum... I gotta dress her up...

314
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,267
Girl...

315
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:24,050
Your Dad thinks you're too old for this.

316
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,974
It's your wedding today!

317
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,987
Mind if I say something, Mehek?

318
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,761
No...

319
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:29,970
These tears don't suit your eyes as you approach your destination...

320
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,175
They should be glowing instead.

321
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:34,844
I'm divided, Adam...

322
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:41,500
Waiting for him didn't let me think of anything...

323
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,420
But now that I know my wait's ending...

324
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,585
It feels like my ageing Grandpa's holding me back...

325
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:59,300
If he found out about this... Any of this...

326
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,526
I fear his heart may succumb to dishonour...

327
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,988
Come in...

328
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,346
The groom looks ready!

329
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,479
It's time for the nuptials...

330
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,841
The guests and the Reverend are waiting for you.

331
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:05,246
Many congratulations to you...

332
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,028
And...

333
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:09,661
And... Many more to you.

334
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,900
Come.

335
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
