1
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,015
Come in.

2
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,200
Don't be shy...

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,232
Greet him.

4
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:55,118
Good day, sir...

5
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,909
Adam...?

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,427
You know him?

7
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,723
I should never've gone out of the way...

8
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:37,086
Every time I've done that, it's come back to haunt me...

9
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,769
Why'd I stop them from searching you?

10
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:48,250
Losing your wits... The first sign that fate has abandoned you. About time you accepted you've lost.

11
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,270
How'd you get here?

12
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,529
How'd Roshni get here?

13
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,400
Yeah?

14
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,580
I've bought her... With my hard-earned money!

15
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:08,180
The more I've struggled, the more I've learnt to value money!

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,540
I ain't gonna let you take her away just like that...
-Oh, I won't mind shooting you right now!

17
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:23,680
Lemme go! I ain't so mad or stubborn as to lose my life so easily!

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,220
Come in! Quick!

19
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,800
C'mon, now! In here!
-Guards!

20
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:31,911
Don't be stupid.

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,910
I've got guards armed to the teeth down there.

22
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,661
Don't even think about it.

23
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:50,761
I left second thoughts and the fear of death on my way. If your guards tried anything, I won't think twice before putting a bullet in your head!

24
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,758
Ma'am...

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,900
Ma'am?

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,645
Ma'am... This arrived by the post... For Mr Malik... I forgot to give it to you because Guddi sent me on an errand...

27
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,265
Last chance...

28
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:43,414
Don't do anything stupid, or my guards would love to break your bones! Guards!

29
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,845
Drop your guns or I'm firing on three! Do it!

30
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:51,657
Just let him go! She ain't more valuable than your life!

31
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:53,485
One...

32
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,876
Two...

33
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,192
Drop your guns!

34
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,118
Here.

35
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,808
Over here...

36
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:07,462
Anyone else? Come with me if you want.

37
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,048
Me...

38
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,868
Oooh...

39
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,560
You're making a big mistake...

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,468
You don't know who we work for.

41
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:26,698
If you made it out of here alive, I'm sure you'd be found dead on the way...

42
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:32,150
And if you're lucky to get home in one piece...

43
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,960
Be prepared to pay ten times the price...

44
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,540
We'll kill you... And your family!
-Empty threats! Come! Back off!

45
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,410
Back off!

46
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,450
Yeah... Back off...

47
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,818
'Ahmed Malik' (...) 'Mir Adampore'

48
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,477
My dearest foe...

49
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:18,037
By the end of this letter, you'll know who I am.

50
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,980
I was very young when, eight years ago,

51
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,161
You gave me wounds too deep for my age.

52
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:29,270
Remember Nadia?

53
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,020
The girl you sought to defile?

54
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,560
The girl who valued her honour more than her life and jumped from the balcony?

55
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,530
She's been in a coma since then.

56
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,676
Everything's finished, except her breaths...

57
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:51,554
That I've been guarding for eight long years,

58
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:56,067
Stoking the flames of retribution...

59
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,853
I hear you're laid up... Can't walk, can't even get up...

60
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:03,490
But that isn't nearly enough for you... You deserve much more...

61
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,079
So I took your daughter and sold her off to a whorehouse.

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,088
At long last, I've settled the scores.

63
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,638
Now, all that's left...

64
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:19,778
Is ashes... Cold ashes...

65
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:28,550
I pray you go to sleep every night praying it's your last...

66
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,170
Sorry...

67
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,129
It took me a while...

68
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,998
Take him away! Lock him up!

69
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,340
Thought you could get away, eh?

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,119
Don't even think about it!

71
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:49,975
You! Run away from Ruby? Impossible!

72
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:02,350
Looks like karma finally caught up, Ahmed Malik!

73
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,630
You are responsible for our disgrace!

74
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,060
Just you!

75
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,580
Here! Look at this! Look at what you've done! Look at where you got us!

76
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,230
Your lechery has cost us all our honour!

77
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:30,077
Your filthy past caught up with my innocent daughter and devoured her!

78
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,460
Mehek!

79
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,660
Madame's beating Mr Malik real bad! He's screaming!

80
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,631
Take care of Shahmir...

81
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:57,513
I'll go look...

82
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,451
She's mad! Put that down!
-I'll kill you!

83
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,120
I'll kill you!

84
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Stop! Put it down!
-You destroyed everything!

85
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,670
I'm gonna kill you!
-Aunt...

86
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,600
Geroff me!
-Stop her!
-Please, Aunt... For God's sake...

87
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,660
For God's sake... Please... Don't...

88
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,131
I talked to Adam... He's found Roshni!

89
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,497
Adam's promised me he'll bring her back... Please...

90
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:39,485
Please stop...
-Roshni...

91
00:09:39,485 --> 00:09:41,865
He'll bring her back...

92
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,318
Roshni...

93
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,250
Aunt...
-My girl...

94
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,750
My little girl...

95
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,638
What've you done...

96
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,708
Such cowardly courage...

97
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,629
Couldn't last a moment, eh?

98
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:30,909
Tied... Captive... Free no more...

99
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:36,070
Look who's talking... The one who had to strike from behind!

100
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,759
My hands are tied...

101
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,962
Not my mind!

102
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,551
I'll take her with me...

103
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:49,379
Or die trying...

104
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,828
Leave.

105
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,588
Her fancy man, I presume?

106
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:14,359
Oh, Madame Ruby... There's a lot more to life...

107
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,790
I know men inside out.

108
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,058
I know them better than a mother knows her kid.

109
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:29,478
You've never met a real man before, have you?

110
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:36,420
If you had, you would've been his pride, his crown jewel... Not out here in the market like this!
-Shut up!

111
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,938
Shut your gob...

112
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:49,393
I've seen the most upright men who take pride in their loyal wives enjoy themselves in the dogbox!

113
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:52,247
Thousands...

114
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:54,553
Thousands of men.

115
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,627
Not one of them a 'real man', you say?
-Just one.

116
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:01,612
If only you'd bother to look in front of you!

117
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:08,728
Chained and courting death... But as upright and honourable as always!

118
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,500
Tell me...

119
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,168
All of this...

120
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:20,038
Don't you think it's... Wrong?

121
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,213
It's your son, innit? Over there?

122
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,430
So...

123
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,110
How'd you kill <i>his</i> conscience? His honour?

124
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,518
Eh?

125
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,240
How d'you get him to sleep in peace?

126
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,841
How can he live with the knowledge...?

127
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:44,010
What does he think of what his Mum's doing?

128
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,618
Oh...

129
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:50,227
So this is wrong...

130
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,180
What about...

131
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,201
My life in that shambly shack...

132
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:03,501
Cramped... Broken windows... Cracked walls... No money to fix any of it...

133
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:16,892
And the men... Staring like a pack of hungry wolves as I cooked and cleaned and swept the floor... What d'you say about that?

134
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:21,121
And you better know this...

135
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:24,901
My son was not so low-down as you think...

136
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:28,081
Just... Hungry...

137
00:13:28,081 --> 00:13:37,286
Whenever his conscience cried out... I'd shut him up with a piece of bread...

138
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:39,706
He was low and vile!

139
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:45,090
Honour burgeons on virtuous hunger, not sinful nibbles!

140
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,980
Oh, can it!

141
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,950
Lemme turn off the lights and fans... Give you a taste of it...

142
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,970
Lemme see how upright you are when your throat dries up and your stomach starts growling...

143
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,021
N -- No!

144
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,570
Please... No...

145
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,460
Don't leave us here...

146
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,722
Please...

147
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,720
Help...

148
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,771
I want to go home...

149
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,029
Just a few more days...

150
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,699
Get back on your feet and get even!

151
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:55,729
And, if you start havin' fun, get more than even! It's only fair!

152
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:23,388
There was a princess... Her brothers, the 7 princes, decided to go huntung...

153
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:27,949
So she started nagging them...

154
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,378
Still up?
-Yeah, Dad.

155
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,578
Wait...

156
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,438
We need to talk...

157
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,142
You're all grown up...

158
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,758
Is that you telling yourself or us?

159
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,078
Both.

160
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,008
Masooma...

161
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:06,402
There's something you must know...

162
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:08,273
Yeah?

163
00:16:08,273 --> 00:16:11,382
The marriage is in a few days.

164
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:16,912
My doll's getting married?
-No. <i>My</i> doll's getting married.

165
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:19,057
Your doll?

166
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,132
Masooma... My little doll...

167
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,593
You're getting married...

168
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:26,303
You're getting married to Shayan.

169
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,908
Easy there.

170
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,342
She's not going anywhere.

171
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:46,014
She'll be here. With you.

172
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:55,157
Get her jewellery and her gown tomorrow.

173
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,148
Good night.

174
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,018
Please don't cry...

175
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,168
Still up?

176
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:32,378
This nightmare won't let me sleep...

177
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:34,947
Good that you're here...

178
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:37,287
We need to talk.

179
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:40,250
The Reverend's coming the day after tomorrow.

180
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,960
Everything else is ready for the marriage.

181
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,498
You're getting married.

182
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:56,020
We've got to account for our deeds before our Lord...

183
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,219
What d'you think you'd say?

184
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:09,158
I'll tell Him I've done a father's duty in finding the best match for my daughter. He will reward me.

185
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,238
No more questions.

186
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,649
Get ready...

187
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,960
Shayan!

188
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,338
Did you see Khawar around?

189
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:37,648
I've been calling him but he's not answering.

190
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,208
I'm sure he's around here... Get some rest. He'll be back.

191
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:46,438
Chutki isn't used to sleeping without him. She likes to lie down on his chest.

192
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:53,018
She falls ill if he has to go somewhere. Gets a bad fever.

193
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:58,238
Mind if I ask something?
-No?

194
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:04,558
If you had to choose between your husband and your children...?

195
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,549
Don't you fear God? Even sworn enemies won't say that!

196
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:14,060
I can't imagine living without my husband.

197
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,747
And my kids... They're a bit of my soul.

198
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:20,128
If I had to choose...

199
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:22,928
If I had to choose... I'd pick death.

209
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,117
Shahmir...

210
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,401
Boyo...

211
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,123
How you doin'?

212
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:14,641
Munna...

213
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,052
Yeah?

214
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,969
I need your thoughts on something...

215
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:20,680
My thoughts?

216
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:31,960
Mum, Granny, my sister, and Dad always told me to ask my elders before doing anything.

217
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,980
But why are you asking little me?

218
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,630
You're the only one who knows my secret.

219
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,738
I'm thinking of telling Grandpa everything.

220
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:48,050
Tell that he's... My son...

221
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:54,868
Mum says that this inner voice is God's... You should listen to it.

222
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,668
This number is not answering your call.

223
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,395
This number is not answering your ca --

224
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,728
What's up, Adam?

225
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,448
I hope he's fine...

226
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,970
O God... I'm sure you're thinking that this girl's always cursed others... But they were evil... More than me, at least...

227
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:40,172
But he's a nice man... So I pray You... Protect him, my Lord...

228
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:41,317
Amen...

229
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:46,648
Okay. I'll tell Grandpa everything.

230
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:52,427
Today... I can't wait any more.

231
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,877
Munna! Out!

232
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,923
On your feet!

233
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:05,268
Close the door behind you!

234
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,488
Go to the devil! And see your Shayan there. Because I know he's with the devil!

235
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:19,398
But I pity the kid who - forget feeling his warmth - has never even heard his Tad's voice!

236
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,490
You love to wound others and rub salt in them, don't you?

237
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,730
Curse your wounds and the salt!

238
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:35,760
I speak the truth. Ain't my problem if it wounds you or rubs salt in your wounds. Sort it out with your truth. By the way, when'd you talk to Adam?

239
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,741
In the afternoon.

240
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:49,140
You've got no shame... You threw him into the maw but don't even bother to ask if he's even alive! His phone's been switched off for five hours!

241
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,258
Yeah?

242
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:15,249
Adam's phone is off. Did you talk to him?

243
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:20,724
It's been five hours since I talked to him... Mum's worried too...

244
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:23,969
Don't worry...

245
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm sure he just... Got tired on the way... Dozed off or something...

246
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,198
I pray that's it... Hope we hear from him.

247
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:34,075
Hope so... Bye.

248
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,228
O Lord...

249
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,179
Keep Adam safe...

250
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,968
Amen.

251
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:54,808
First time I've felt like saying 'Amen' to your prayers, by the way!

252
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,360
I've got to tell Grandpa everything...

253
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,207
Before the weight of my lies kills me...

254
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,300
Grandpa...

255
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,850
Are you alright?

256
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,920
A man's alright...

257
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,595
As long as the shroud of honour...

258
00:25:34,595 --> 00:25:39,391
Worn by his pride...

259
00:25:39,391 --> 00:25:43,191
Is unsoiled...

260
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:47,050
And if anything...

261
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,170
Smirches it...

262
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,441
What follows...

263
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,210
Is war...

264
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,338
A war between...

265
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:02,492
Honour and life...

266
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,010
Roshni's blackened it...

267
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,988
Completely...

268
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:18,000
Honour may lose this one...

269
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,450
And death prevail...

270
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,190
God forbid anything happen to you.

271
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,481
You're my strength.

272
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:29,809
Don't give me a fright.

273
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,338
Got word on Roshni?

274
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:37,178
Yeah. I talked to Adam.

275
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:42,408
He says he's found her... Promised me he'll bring her back...

276
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:47,260
Before anyone else got word of any of this...

277
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,270
No one will see the smirches...

278
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:56,550
Your honour won't be stained...

279
00:26:56,931 --> 00:26:59,240
I wish your words...

280
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,710
Godspeed...

281
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,870
To His ears...

282
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,821
Amen.

283
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,358
Grandpa...

284
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:30,968
There's something I need to tell you...

285
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,660
Yes?

286
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:41,782
Promise me you'll forgive my first and last mistake.

287
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:46,570
When daughters were born...

288
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,928
People used to mourn her birth...

289
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:59,928
I despised them...

290
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:05,610
More beasts and devils than men and women, all of them...

291
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:11,409
But today... I know what they feared...

292
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:14,750
They didn't fear their daughters...

293
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:21,001
They feared disgrace at the hands of their daughters.

294
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,301
I feel like going back...

295
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:32,041
Embracing them... And joining in...

296
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,288
Anyway... Go on...

297
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:39,620
What is it?

298
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,748
G -- Grandpa...

299
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:46,779
My --

300
00:28:48,138 --> 00:28:51,929
T -- This son --

301
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:53,980
Guddi --

302
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,322
The doctor's here to check on Grandpa.

303
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:05,150
Call him in.
-Come in, doc!

304
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,320
Good evening. Come in...
-'Evening.

305
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,008
How do you feel now, Mr Malik? Better?

306
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,850
A bit...
-Great.

307
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,267
Munna... Get him a cuppa...

308
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:25,538
Thanks, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

309
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,438
Doctor...

310
00:29:58,438 --> 00:30:00,518
How's he?

311
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:03,018
Better...
-Thank God...

312
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:08,909
I'm changing his medicines... Come.
-Alright...

313
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:19,469
To be honest, he isn't all that well... Keep him well away from stress and trauma.

314
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:23,870
Take care. Good night...
-Good night...

315
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,070
God forbid that I tell him...

316
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,290
He's my son and not Guddi's...

317
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,031
Whoa...

318
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:55,501
He wants to hear my story too...

319
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,913
Fair enough...

320
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:01,134
You ain't the first...

321
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:08,620
Every man who came here seemed to love sympathising and saying that they cared...

322
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,110
Easy for them to shield their own sins that way I guess...

323
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,352
I don't need to shield anything.

324
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:19,388
Because I'm not a sinner.

325
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,930
You want to get out. I know you didn't come here because you wanted to.

326
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:31,280
The 'f' in 'women' stands for freedom here.

327
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,687
But the 'e' in 'men' sure screams 'entitlement'.

328
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,589
Anyway, here goes...

329
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,833
Paw lost his eyes in an accident.

330
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:48,932
They said there was no one to sustain us...

331
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:51,952
Because I've got no brothers...

332
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:59,760
Paw's eyes - as long as they were of any use - searched for means to make ends meet by day...

333
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,870
And watched out for the lecherous gaze of the pervs by night...

334
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:10,920
He lost his eyes. We lost our means... And our safety...

335
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,950
The village head sent me to her sister's to earn what I could...

336
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,921
I met a man there...

337
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,660
He didn't dare lay an eye on me for eight days... His wife was around him...

338
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:35,978
Until one day, his wife left for her parents'. She got out of the house. His lust got out of its prison of 'modesty'.

339
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:40,950
He tried to force himself on me...

340
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,720
But... I managed to run away...

341
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,650
I bumped into a good Samaritan on the way...

342
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:55,671
He seemed only too willing to help...

343
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:58,292
And I was a woman...

344
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:03,541
Women see one good thing in a man...

345
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:08,610
And think he's everything they need...

346
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:20,148
Two days, he took to ensnare me. Four days, he fooled me with his 'love'. Come the fifth, and the bad Samaritan sold me here for five hundred bags.

347
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,220
I've broken out twice... But come back again...

348
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,358
I seem to forget that the men who come here... Come from out there...

349
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,604
Roshni's way more lucky.

350
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:47,484
You came here to save her... Even if it means dying for her...

351
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,200
So many died for us...

352
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,988
But not to save us...

353
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,106
Want me to go on?
-No... Please...

354
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:30,120
You aren't taking Madame's calls! I don't bother, but she's so worried!

355
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,090
But I do bother that you're making a big mistake!

356
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,925
What?

357
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,988
I don't grow close to anyone. I don't even let the thought grow close to me.

358
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:48,760
But I've got to stay here. And you've got to come here to see me because you want it.

359
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,818
Guess what, Madame's your key! So could you please keep things going and not change overnight?

360
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:59,658
Your eyes have clouded my mind...

361
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,738
Afflicted my heart...

362
00:35:02,738 --> 00:35:08,169
The doctor's fallen sick himself! You can't seriously expect him to treat others!

363
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,780
Come see me tomorrow morning and get your dose. Take care.

364
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,378
Bye.

365
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,209
Flippin' Fakespeare...

366
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,349
Madame!

367
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,569
Madame Ruby!

368
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,621
I've come back before! Why've you kept me in here?

369
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:48,641
Jesus... Can't even scratch my head!

370
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:51,084
Madame Ruby!

371
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,718
Hit the hay, I guess... Easy for her...

372
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:59,949
Easy money eases sleep...

373
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,410
Would you help me?

374
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:15,689
Blimey, I can't even scratch my own head. How d'you expect me to help you?
-Untie my hand.

375
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,960
How? By lookin' at it?

376
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,580
Looks can only untie chained hearts...

377
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,851
I'd need my hands for this...

378
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,628
What's the matter?

379
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,438
Untie me and I'll untie you.

380
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:54,759
Naw, mate... I can't do it...

381
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:57,410
I can't even untie myself...

382
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,900
Wait... Lemme help you first...

383
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
