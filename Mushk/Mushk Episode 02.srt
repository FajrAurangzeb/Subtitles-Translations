1
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,996
Mehek!

2
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,975
So my curiosity finally broke your silence...

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,266
So you've loved, too...

4
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,151
A prisoner of love...

5
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:29,183
Behind bars...

6
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,855
May the Lord...

7
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:35,559
May the Lord free you...

8
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,984
Free you...

9
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,401
Mehek...

10
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,780
Mehek!

11
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,075
I'm starving.

12
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,621
Weren't you back then?

13
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:08,220
A little...

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,546
I've never had anything without some diet cola.

15
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,942
Where'd you get diet cola this late?

16
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,750
Don't know. Don't care. I just know I have to have my diet cola. Right now.

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:35,670
Because I grow peckish by the moment. That makes me angry. Raises my blood pressure. A shout or two may kill me, and I'm in no mood to die tonight.

18
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,416
So if you want the night to be peaceful and quiet, you better get me some.

19
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,473
There, now...

20
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,530
Take care of him.

21
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,303
O Lord, You are great!

22
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:54,361
It only took You moments to set him free...

23
00:03:55,152 --> 00:04:00,815
May he have no trouble on his way.

24
00:04:04,674 --> 00:04:07,584
Go.

25
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:11,895
Careful...

26
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,053
Hey!

27
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,760
Come here!

28
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,165
Aren't you coming?

29
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:31,004
Just go!

30
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,141
The journey ahead of you is long...

31
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:41,895
Mine ends somewhere around here...

32
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:44,409
Go...

33
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,991
Well, then...

34
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,725
Take care!

35
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,024
Take care.

36
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,120
I think there's someone there.

37
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,505
Where?
-Over there.

38
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,576
No one here. You're hearing things!

39
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,277
I want this money in the bank on time.
-Okay.

40
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:15,774
Munna!

41
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,480
Go. Bye.

42
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,042
Where are you going?

43
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,246
To the shop.
-Right now?

44
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,856
But the shops close at 9.

45
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:36,060
I know, Adam... But Mehek's asked me to get her a det cola. She had me swear I won't tell anyone!

46
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,580
What's a det cola?

47
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,565
Sugar-free.

48
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,709
Diet, ah yes...

49
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,334
Where'd you get one at this hour?

50
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,381
Go, I'll get it.

51
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,581
Here.

52
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,613
Keep the money.

53
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:54,194
She'll be waiting!

54
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,780
They'll be worried if I took the car out.

55
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,959
It's just a kilometre away... Ish...

56
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,960
Time for a walk in the moonlight, I guess?

57
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,954
Mehek!

58
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,823
Mehek!

59
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,010
What's that?

60
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,830
Well, what does it look like? Used to be bars...

61
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,606
Stood firm for a long time...

62
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,660
But gave way now.

63
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,076
Where's Shayan?

64
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,498
Shayan?

65
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:31,954
Where's he? He -- Ah, yes...

66
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,752
He's out.

67
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:34,941
Out?

68
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:37,920
Out there waiting for you.

69
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,980
Go and catch him if you can!

70
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:47,160
I'll take care of you later, you bleedin' codger!
-Catch him if you can!

71
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,048
Mr Khan! Shayan's run away!
-Mr Khan!

72
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,045
Don't get caught...

73
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,925
Just get away...

74
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,650
In the car, double time!
-C'mon, Khan!

75
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,451
I'm getting dizzy, you know!

76
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,991
Keep your voice down!

77
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,056
I'll go see... Munna would be on his way back...
-Oh, please!

78
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,190
Check any car or bike that comes here.

79
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,669
He must not escape!

80
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,880
Where to?

81
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,170
Back from the University. You know...
-Eh?

82
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,838
Let them go.
-Go.

83
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,813
Stop the car!

84
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,814
Stop!

85
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,066
Yeah?
-Yes sir...

86
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:15,630
Where are you coming from?
-From a wedding... Just family in here...

87
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,663
Let us see...
-You can't just!

88
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:40,450
I'm sure you have mothers and sisters... These are my daughters and daughters-in-law... Please don't remove their veils.

89
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,960
Let them pass!

90
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,318
Go.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you.

91
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,436
Hey, Asim...
-Hello there, Adam... How come you're here so late and... Without your car?

92
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,230
Yeah, I...

93
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,190
Give me...

94
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,689
A carton of diet cola.

95
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,041
I knew you close your shop at 11.

96
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,738
I prayed that your shop's open when I get here.

97
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:26,797
Just my luck!
-Yeah, I close at 11... Just got a little late with things...

98
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,890
It's about to rain, Asim...

99
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:56,744
But not here. It's windy. The clouds will be far away before they rain.

100
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,951
Asim! I told you it's gonna rain!

101
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,798
You're yawning, Aliya... Making me sleepy too... I got a test tomorrow.

102
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,760
Go, get some sleep.
-I'm not sleepy.

103
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,557
You don't know it but you are. Go get some rest.

104
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,908
I --
-Yeah. Go...

105
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,674
What are you doing here? You're out of your mind!

106
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,990
Of course. My love for you drove me mad the moment I saw you.

107
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,071
What are you doing here?

108
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,981
Justice.

109
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,980
What kind of justice?
-Doing justice to your memory.

110
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,610
For God's sake, get out. They're gonna kill me!

111
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,729
God forbid! I pray our love be immortal...

112
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,350
Just... Go.

113
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,050
Go!

114
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,926
What's that on your hand?
-What? It's nothing, really...

115
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,507
Go!

116
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,306
Go before someone sees you! Careful!

117
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,270
Mind your step!

Mr Khan... I'm sorry...

132
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:10,026
I've got kids... An ageing Mum and an ill Dad...

133
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,762
I fell asleep... I didn't notice... Mr Khan...

134
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,910
You didn't just fall asleep...

135
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,010
The Reaper's knocks put you to sleep.

136
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,031
Mr Khan... Please...

137
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,700
The dogs can have their treat...

138
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,956
Bless, O Father, Thy gifts to our use and us to Thy service; for Christ's sake.

139
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,692
Amen.

140
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:20,690
I felt like I should thank you for this, but my huge favour to you kept staring at me. Kept hushing me.

141
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,890
So, no sorries, no thank yous!

142
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:27,800
Hungry friends, or hungry enemies...

143
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,150
What's the difference?

144
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:37,951
I would've done it for anyone. Without ever expecting a word of thanks.

145
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:52,000
That's what I don't get about you straight and simple types... Why do you bother yourself hoping for some future reward from God?

146
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:10,683
I mean, I believe in His reward, but where do you get the courage, man? Your husband ran away 5 days after your wedding, and - forget cursing him - you don't even say one bad word about him!

147
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:14,190
Because I am the more guilty.

148
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,490
He never forced himself, except when expressing his love.

149
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:26,201
I took the road from love to passion myself.

150
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:29,810
I pressed him to get married.

151
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,732
Fantastic...

152
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:38,632
You just destroyed the image I had of you...

153
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,071
What do you mean?

154
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:49,170
Modest looks, care for everyone, care for mankind... It just took a moment for everything to sound so suspicious!

155
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:55,059
I mean, look at how much Grandpa trusts you. Look at the great man he is. Now look at who you are.

156
00:19:55,059 --> 00:20:00,830
If anyone asked him to give another name to trust and faith, I'm sure he wouldn't think before saying 'Mehek'!

157
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:08,280
And, Iesu, look at his Mehek! Pressuring a lad to get married, all in secret, now living a lie. Chuffing lovely!

158
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,016
I did what I thought was best. For me and my love.

159
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:21,214
Do you think my love would blind me so much that I'd let him go without giving him reason to come back?

160
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:27,600
I can't say about blinding you... But I can see that you didn't give him reason <i>enough</i> to come back.

161
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:36,150
He broke the shackles in his feet the moment he stepped out, before trampling your faith under them and disappearing forever!

162
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:40,126
He hasn't disappeared... He just hasn't come back.

163
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,755
I'm sure he has his reasons...

164
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:46,876
I'll ask him when I see him.

165
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,510
Blimey, such unshakeable faith!

166
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:58,930
You forced him into marrying you so he wouldn't run away, and now you're denying that he ran away! D'you suppose he's gone off to China to get some toys for your kid?

167
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,876
I had my reasons...

168
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,555
What?

169
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,416
I had a friend...

170
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,007
Shanzay...

171
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:17,540
No way I'm going to sleep before I've heard this one.

172
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,797
Here.

173
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:44,970
I've got a chance to be kind after so long... Poverty and drudgery have me occupied round the clock...

174
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:50,046
How far is Mir Adam?

175
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:52,715
About 4 hours from here.

176
00:21:52,715 --> 00:22:01,100
But your Uncle controls everything in the area. There's a police checkpoint ahead. He may catch you there.

177
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,510
So I'll tell the police he had me locked up!

178
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:13,260
Don't be stupid. The law kneels before men like your Uncle.

179
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,992
You want to get there or not?

180
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,040
How much?
-120 for the tea.

181
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,796
Okay.

182
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:37,180
Her heart's weak. I think she's in shock.

183
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,666
She's safe now, but any worry or shock may be dangerous.

184
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,946
Fakhr... Shayan's dearest friend.

185
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:55,025
And Shanzay, mine...

186
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,741
We used to see each other together.

187
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:03,857
That's when they took a liking to each other.

188
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:15,739
Shanzay didn't think much... She lost her heart to Fakhr.

189
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:23,066
She just saw the beginning of a happy life... She never thought about the end.

190
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,434
And he left for Pakistan, saying he'd be back in 15 days.

191
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,211
Apparently, he's been doing as the Romans do!

192
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,190
I'm sorry, I have this habit of joking... Can't disappoint my old habit!

193
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,641
Anyway, go on.

194
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,051
15 days became 1 month, and soon, 2.

195
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:03,958
Shanzay got ill.

196
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,840
Not a word. Not a trace. Not a hope.

197
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,530
Her lively face became barren.

198
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:22,852
Full Juliet. Complete with the sadness!

199
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,529
Innit?

200
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,130
Yeah.

201
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,864
It was her love...

202
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,670
She came to my room one day...

203
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,470
Shanzay!
-Mehek!

204
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,261
What happened?
-Mehek...

205
00:25:40,261 --> 00:25:43,029
Easy there...

206
00:25:43,778 --> 00:25:44,965
Mehek...

207
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:49,123
My life, my dreams... Everything's finished!

208
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:54,706
God forbid! What are you saying? What happened?

209
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:58,347
Fakhr got married in Pakistan.

210
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,360
I'm sure you're mistaken.

211
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm sure he's joking!
-I'm not mistaken!

212
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:15,600
He called and told me himself. Sent me this picture! He said I'm no one to him!

213
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,347
That's Fakhr! I'm ruined now, Mehek!

214
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,655
Shanzay!

215
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:24,925
Shanzay!

216
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,132
That's when I got insecure about my love.

217
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,956
You ought to be.

218
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,383
Orders, Mr Khan?

219
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,406
Any progress?

220
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:20,750
He's left a trail and we're on it.

221
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,650
Rest assured, sir. You'll have him by the morning.

222
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,166
Bless me!

223
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,435
Adam...

224
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,615
You were smiling.

225
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:14,044
Yeah.

226
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:16,251
I saw you.

227
00:28:17,924 --> 00:28:19,420
Where?

228
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,261
Here. Smiling, of course.

229
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,583
Oh...

230
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,226
Don't ask me why.

231
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:36,381
Oh I wouldn't dare. I know it already. I know everything!

232
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,771
Pray tell me?

233
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:45,660
I'm sure you saw Mehek a while back. You're smiling because you're thinking of her.

234
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,080
No I'm not.
-Yes you are.

235
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,713
I told you.
-I told you.

236
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:54,657
Guria... Go to sleep.

237
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,531
Shayan's Mum fell ill a while later.

238
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,970
Or at least... That's what he told me.

239
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,398
He'd graduated by then.

240
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:29,020
It almost killed me when he talked about going back.

241
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,744
Mehek...

242
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:41,855
You're my world.

243
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,201
I can't live without you.

244
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:54,513
Leaving you pains me a lot.

245
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,591
I swear by you, I'll be back soon.

246
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,496
If you can't believe me... Come with me. We'll go together.

247
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:16,410
Come back together too.

248
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:19,037
That's what Fakhr said...

249
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:28,340
He wrapped his false promises to Shanzay in sweet words too.

250
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,437
You're doing the same, aren't you?

251
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:52,486
The fear of losing him blinded my unfortunate self...

252
00:30:52,486 --> 00:31:02,535
To Grandpa's trust... My family... Their love... Everything...

253
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,553
So what do you want?

254
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,967
Marry me.

255
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:29,262
I will.

256
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,780
I never saw him after he was gone.

257
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,376
His number was off... Offline on Facebook... His old place was empty.

258
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:55,130
Ever thought about suicide?

259
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,130
I did.

260
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,970
Almost ended my life twice.

261
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,310
What stopped you?

262
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:07,454
The first time, I found out about the child growing inside me.

263
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:13,670
The second, when my grief forced my courage to its knees...

264
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,545
Yeah?

265
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,310
I heard the call to pray on my phone. Just like now.

266
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,640
I felt a fear of God...

267
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,490
Then heard the call again. Carefully, this time.

268
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:41,060
I felt my courage get back on its feet by the time it ended.

269
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,780
This is as far as we go.

270
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:06,745
There's a sewer over there, and across from it there's a police station.

271
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:10,275
I wish I could do more for you.

272
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,120
I haven't got anything for you.

273
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,906
Take care. May the Lord protect you.

274
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,200
And yeah, don't do something silly.

275
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,611
Bye.
-Bye.

276
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:46,775
So you forgot your family's trust in you for the puny fear of your lover never coming back?

277
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:49,880
Never thought what'd happen if he never came back?

278
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,090
You outta your mind, eh, girl? You outta your blimmin' mind?

279
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:01,306
Two days after the marriage, I was just as surprised as you.

280
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:06,950
Only you're laughing, and I was crying.

281
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:13,310
Just... Just tell me what you were thinking when you got married.

282
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,095
You don't think.

283
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,120
The heart sends the brain off on vacation the moment it falls for someone.

284
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,340
The heart thought about its fear and made me do it.

285
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,250
At least someone thought about something!

286
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,595
Anyway... Go to sleep. It's morning already.

287
00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:42,078
Everyone gets up early here.
-I'll get up when I want.

288
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:49,626
Do me a favour, will you? Blockade all ways to me.

289
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:43,798
Help me with this, bro... I don't get anything! 7th grade maths is really hard!

290
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:48,340
Come, Masooma... The car's waiting for you. Your Mum's got to go to the market after dropping you at your tutor's.

291
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:54,270
Just a minute, Dad. Let me ask Shayan just one question.

292
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,990
I told you not to call him bro.

293
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,660
Just say Mr Khan.

294
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,680
Okay, Dad.

295
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,910
Shayan... I thought I'd see you before I leave. You've got a flight today. You must be late.

296
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,491
Of course, Aunt.

297
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:15,675
Bless you. Come.

298
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:19,486
Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

299
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,000
Uncle...

300
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,659
What was that about 'bro'?

301
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:36,440
She used to be like your sister.

302
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,260
What do you mean?

303
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,914
It's been 40 days since your mother passed away.

304
00:36:43,914 --> 00:36:48,451
I never had the time between the grief and the tears...

305
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,203
But?

306
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:55,840
But I had your mother promise me before she passed away...

307
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,836
Promise what?

308
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,160
We betrothed you to Masooma.

309
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:07,000
She's your fiancée now.

310
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
