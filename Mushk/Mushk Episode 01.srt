The train's always half an hour late! But it's here!

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,532
Maybe one of the toffs is on board...

13
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:11,610
Or maybe someone's been waiting too long...

14
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,520
Aren't you here to work?

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,400
They'll come to me when they need me.

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:52,918
There's three porters around... And a lot of passengers! They get to decide how much they're gonna pay!

17
00:01:52,918 --> 00:02:02,543
Be grateful for what you can get, or the Lord takes everything from you! Amour, cœur, and grandeur!

18
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,835
See you!

19
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,946
O Lord... She's back...

20
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,425
My girl...

21
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:37,564
Mehek...

22
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:42,441
Realising my dreams;

23
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:45,701
My prayers have borne fruit.

24
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:50,990
My Lord, Thou art great because Thou art just.

25
00:02:50,990 --> 00:03:04,686
It would be injustice to all of mankind if I, the lord of this bourg, chose to remain blind to injustice.

26
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:15,363
She never let the battle for justice cease after my son's death...

27
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:22,940
She's earned the highest degree in law as I wished.

28
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,710
You heard my prayers.

29
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,095
You grant the wishes of those who ask for Your help.

30
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:36,976
So I pray Thee - never let my daughter weep, O Lord. Never...

31
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:41,880
Right or left -- Oops! That was close!

32
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:51,880
Hello?

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,421
Qutbuddin? It's Mehek.

34
00:03:54,421 --> 00:03:57,851
Mehek! It's Munna!

35
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:05,110
Qutbuddin's reading the news. I nicked his mobile to play games. Please don't tell him.

36
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:12,296
I won't. Don't worry. I called Grandpa but he isn't answering.

37
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:14,772
Tell him I'll be there in 20 minutes.

38
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:20,107
You're coming? Grandpa was praying. He was about to go pick you up!

39
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:22,730
But wasn't your train supposed to come at 7?

40
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,761
Yeah. Got here early.

41
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:30,760
You promised you'd get me a touchscreen mobile.

42
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah. I've got you.

43
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,298
Really?

44
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:36,592
Really.

45
00:04:36,592 --> 00:04:40,416
Okay. I'll go tell Grandpa.

46
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,114
Everyone's suspecting each other

47
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:06,542
Because they've seen you on that bike follow our bus!

48
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:08,016
So what?

49
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:13,180
I wait all night for the morning... For that one glimpse of you.

50
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,478
When you get to the college, I wait for the afternoon...

51
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:21,131
You don't even get to see me everytime!

52
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,696
Do you see me?

53
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:28,560
Let's just say I manage to... Even if I have to push a few people around...

54
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,266
That's it, then.

55
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,615
What?

56
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:36,049
If you love someone and get to see him... It's Christmas indeed.

57
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:42,738
And there's nothing like him seeing you without you finding out!

58
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:47,604
Roshni!

59
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,661
What's with the screaming?

60
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,676
You'll have to hear it to believe it!

61
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:52,570
Yeah?

62
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,690
Mehek's coming!

63
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,252
Okay, get me some water...

64
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:07,790
Close...

65
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,921
Mum would kill me if Munna told anyone I had a phone.

66
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:15,258
I could've gotten you another.

67
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:18,796
You only live once.

68
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:22,293
I meant another phone.

69
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,740
Adam!

70
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:48,111
Remember when you got these?

71
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,400
I cried a lot, but you didn't give me those bangles.

72
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,469
I asked who they're for.

73
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,955
You never told me. Just... Got another.

74
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,385
But you never gave these to anyone.

75
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:06,955
You always bought two gifts every Christmas. You'd give one to me, and one to this cupboard.

76
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:10,800
I can see right through you now.

77
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,160
No longer my old, kiddish self.

78
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,563
Why don't you put it plainly, Guria? Why do you want to waste so many words?

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,191
This cupboard's opened again after two years for her, right?

80
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:28,090
These bangles... They're for Mehek, right?

81
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,755
Guria! Adam! Mehek's back!
-Munna!

82
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,004
Let's see... A change in the traffic laws...

83
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:42,562
Fines increased!

84
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,801
Overspeeding... Doubled from 750 to 1,500!

85
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:50,104
Blimey, that's unfair...

86
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:52,154
Ma'am!

87
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,070
Come in!

88
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,019
Meh --

89
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,930
Mehek's on her way! She's coming back!

90
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,403
There goes his siren...

91
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:13,263
Munna! Get a cloth and clean his mouth. It's gonna get dirty the moment his siren stops.

92
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:20,220
Your Dad's sweet little girl is back. This place is hers now.

93
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,460
She's inferior to me in her relationship to him, her age and status.

94
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,575
But Dad thinks so highly of her!

95
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:32,683
That's why I grow restless...

96
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:44,730
As if your cough wasn't enough, now I'll have to toss around all night like a snake, haunted by the authority he's gonna give her!

97
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,341
My dear Zulaikha...
-Eh?

98
00:08:48,341 --> 00:09:00,170
The Minister of State for Railways said a few days back that the trains would arrive on time. Looking at how Mehek's train got here on time, and how easily our people get swayed, we may be looking at our next Prime Minister!

99
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,741
Shut up! Out of my sight! Bloody politician...

100
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,849
Everything fine?

101
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,835
Thank you.

102
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,228
Ask the driver to get the car out.

103
00:09:36,228 --> 00:09:38,357
No need for that!

104
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:39,418
Why?

105
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:40,938
She's coming here!

106
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,403
She told you herself?

107
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:50,902
I could hear that she was on a carriage when she called. I think her train got here early!

108
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,422
Okay...

109
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:54,358
Thank God.

110
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,900
Okay, go...

111
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,996
You have been kind, O Lord.

112
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:47,046
Did the bars budge, or did they just wear down your poor little saw?

113
00:10:47,906 --> 00:10:58,100
You never told me what brought you here,

114
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,260
But looking at your obstinacy,

115
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:15,990
I dare to imagine that that brought you down this rabbit hole.

116
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,376
Keep at it, mate...

117
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,890
Hello! How are you? How was the journey?
-Hello. Help me with these?
-Hello!

118
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,690
Great.
-I'll go tell them inside!

119
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,908
Here...

120
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,290
Uhh... What's your name again...?

121
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,486
Guddi.

122
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,830
Yeah. Come here.

123
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,460
Hold him.

124
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,340
Come with me.

125
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,293
C'mon, quickly!

126
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,850
Hello, Grandpa!
-Hello. Welcome back!

127
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,773
How are you?
-Never been better.

128
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:30,925
How are you?

129
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,078
Hello, Aunt.

130
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,890
Hello...

131
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,160
And who would that be?

132
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,540
G -- Grandpa... Remember --?

133
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,980
Yeah. We can talk later. Come in.

134
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,229
How've you been?

135
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,559
Come, Guddi.

136
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,160
Hello.
-Hello.
-Come.

137
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,236
You're late.

138
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,136
Just 15 minutes. But -- You don't even have a clock here!

139
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:36,085
Silence fills the empty cell...

140
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:42,280
This bloke never says a word...

141
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:50,350
The most I can hear is my breath...

142
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,323
I count them to pass the time...

143
00:14:56,323 --> 00:15:02,827
That's how I know...

144
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:04,829
What?

145
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,315
You'll know when it's your time...

146
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,815
What do you mean?

147
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,161
Go and play, little innocent one...

148
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,400
You won't have to work at it...

149
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
When it's your time, you'll realise...

150
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,096
Go...

151
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:30,426
Oh, shut your trap!

152
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,929
Come, have some...

153
00:15:57,262 --> 00:16:05,031
You'll need more than just tenacity to break free.

154
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,660
Here.

155
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,546
Bless you, my dear.

156
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:51,531
Why don't you bless her?

157
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,568
Good... Sit.

158
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:15,060
Get us our lunch. My little girl's back home after two years!

159
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,051
Mehek...

160
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:24,928
One look at you has made all the waiting worth it.

161
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,106
Grandpa...

162
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:33,420
I've waited for this day too...

163
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,873
Bless you.

164
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,153
Mehek...

165
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:41,861
You haven't told us about her.

166
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,711
Who is she?

167
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:47,562
She worked at Mehek's hostel.

168
00:17:47,562 --> 00:17:49,860
She's the maid?

169
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,750
Why is she sitting on the sofa?

170
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,643
Get up!

171
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:58,088
Only equals can sit like equals!

172
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:01,726
I've never considered her a maid.

173
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,587
She's like a sister.

174
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:10,369
As if we needed any more servants! Why'd you have to bring one from overseas?

175
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:15,996
She's been... Most unfortunate, Aunt... She needs help.

176
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,016
How?

177
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:26,330
Take her upstairs. Get some rest before lunch.

178
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,996
Okay, Grandpa.

179
00:18:27,996 --> 00:18:33,743
I wonder what she's done that is so unspeakable!

180
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:36,410
Come, Guddi. Let me show you your place.

181
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,226
Where's she staying?

182
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:40,148
The room next to mine.

183
00:18:40,148 --> 00:18:44,199
There are many rooms for servants behind the mansion.

184
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:48,990
I'm used to taking her help. It'd be nice if she were close by.

185
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,061
Don't even think about it!

186
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:57,924
You know we let things be as Mehek wants. Willy nilly.

187
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:02,076
Go. Take her upstairs. Get some rest.

188
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:05,726
Okay. Come, Guddi...

189
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,928
I wonder why she had to bring her along!

190
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:24,570
Mehek told me that she's a helpless orphan.

191
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:34,776
She's real fortunate... For a helpless orphan. I mean... Look at how easily she got a visa!

192
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,253
Please don't mind anything Aunt said... Forgive her.

193
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:51,029
Hold him properly, will you? What's his fault?

194
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:54,316
I beg you, forgive her.

195
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:59,116
I'll do my best to make sure you don't have any trouble.

196
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:02,587
Where's my room?

197
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,395
Here.

198
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,420
Indeed, the Lord has been very kind...

199
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:27,010
The thing is... Someone took a liking to Guddi.

200
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,667
Someone from the UK.

201
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:34,633
He took her with him after their marriage.

202
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:39,945
But, as fate would have it, her happiness was short-lived...

203
00:20:39,945 --> 00:20:47,340
He lost his life in an accident three months later,

204
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,883
Leaving Guddi alone in a foreign land.

205
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,380
The poor girl...

206
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,131
Freshen up and come downstairs.

207
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:03,247
60 days. We agreed. It's 58 now.

208
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:07,450
So we did.

209
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,750
Don't worry. I remember.

210
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,880
I don't lie.

211
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,497
Oh really?

212
00:21:12,497 --> 00:21:19,130
You're telling <i>me</i>! You said you'd save me from disgrace! I've seen just how well... Blimey...

213
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:26,481
You brought me here as your partner in crime, to give your lie some credibility...! And you're telling me! <i>I</i> don't lie, byt!

214
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:35,468
I've sinned a thousand times, but not once by lying. Always bold, always audacious. It doesn't lessen my sin, but it does my guilt.

215
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:45,413
You better tell your Aunt to mind her venomous tongue, for I can breathe fire! I've charred many Goliaths to ash!

216
00:21:45,413 --> 00:21:49,713
Calm down. I'll talk to her.

217
00:21:49,713 --> 00:21:52,773
Aye. You better.

218
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,356
She had no one.

219
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,217
So my girl brought her along.

220
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,227
I'm proud of her.

221
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,738
That's very kind of her. The Lord would be pleased.
-Indeed.

222
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:16,110
A bit weak if you ask me...

223
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,398
What?

224
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:19,090
Her story...

225
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:26,086
I can't make head or tail of it... But I do see the stinking carcass of this cock and bull story. Don't you?

226
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,430
Keep your questions to yourself.

227
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,955
This is my place.

228
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:38,240
Everything will be as I want it. I hope you don't forget that.

229
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,818
I'm forgiving your first transgression. You better not do it again.

230
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,362
Step aside!

231
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,695
What happened?

232
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:06,880
My youthful self has never listened to anyone else...

233
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:16,330
Oh, to live for 58 days, longing to see my old self in the mirror, who couldn't live for but 58 minutes without maquillage...

234
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:23,481
Oh, to feel the fury, the anger, but be too helpless to even break the wretched mirror!

235
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,273
Lunch has been served.

236
00:23:32,273 --> 00:23:35,197
I said, lunch has been served.

237
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:38,420
Yeah, I heard it the first time you said it.

238
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,616
Come downstairs.

239
00:23:51,670 --> 00:24:03,328
C'mon, my shawl... The apple of my Dad and brother's eyes... I'm sure you've been yearning to rest on my head! Looks like it's your day!

240
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,270
Iesu... Yeah, I haven't forgotten you!

241
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,605
Munna!

242
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,856
Yeah, Adam?

243
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:29,941
How are you?

244
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,958
Great!

245
00:24:33,361 --> 00:24:36,108
Something you wanted to ask?
-No.

246
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,731
Hey!

247
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:39,557
Yeah?

248
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:42,817
How's everyone?

249
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,659
Great.

250
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:47,315
Okay, go...

251
00:24:47,315 --> 00:24:49,254
And, Munna...

252
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,812
How's Mehek?

253
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:54,321
Looks great. Doesn't seem to be.

254
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,800
What do you mean? Did she say something?

255
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,587
She didn't say anything. But I heard it.

256
00:24:59,587 --> 00:25:00,488
What?

257
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:04,399
She used to laugh at every other word...
-And now?

258
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,870
She doesn't smile... Doesn't even join in when everyone's laughing!

259
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,090
That it?
-Yeah. Go.

260
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:40,150
It pains me so much to hear about Guddi... So kind of you to bring her along.

261
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,290
Her baby's lovely, isn't it?

262
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,488
Yeah. Very.

263
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,750
What did her husband do?

264
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,590
Sorry?

265
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,555
What is it?

266
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:58,246
Didn't she tell you?

267
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,730
No...

268
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:06,540
He's crying...

269
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,460
For God's sake, shut up...

270
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,535
Iesu...

271
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,841
It used to be your cough...

272
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:55,958
Now, that girl has brought another way to give me sleepless nights!

273
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,279
I'll go see...

274
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,156
The poor kid...

275
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,431
What's up with the noise?

276
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,145
Take her back inside.

277
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:24,835
He was crying inside.

278
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:28,035
I thought he'd stop if he got some fresh air.

279
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:31,120
Well you better not take your thoughts out for some fresh air again.

280
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,220
Roshni's Dad isn't well. The noise bothers him.

281
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,530
Go!

282
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,988
Okay...

283
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,353
Tell me...

284
00:28:01,353 --> 00:28:03,306
Yeah?

285
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,460
Did Dad send your fees on time?

286
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:10,011
Of course.

287
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:16,587
Yet it appears you had to sell your decency and good form for this degree!

288
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:18,733
What do you mean?

289
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,513
I don't get it.

290
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,809
Your Uncle's unwell.

291
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:29,974
He loves you more than his daughters.

292
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:35,001
But you never bothered to see him. Check on him.

293
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,703
I --

294
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:41,704
I'll go see him now...

295
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,415
Hello, Uncle...

296
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,083
Hello.

297
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,724
I hope you're well.

298
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:01,621
I don't know...

299
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:05,770
I just know I'm... Still around...

300
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,840
May the Lord give you health.
-Amen.

301
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,806
I'll be back.

302
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,591
You won't forget, will you?

303
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:15,843
Of course not.

304
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,110
Cau dy geg!

305
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,660
What is it?

306
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,170
Well, what d'you think? He needs his Mam! That's you, numbskull!

307
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,441
Here!
-Keep your voice down!

308
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,856
My boy...

309
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,590
I've tried 70 different ways... It sure ain't love he's craving!

310
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,911
He needs milk!

311
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,692
I got you...

312
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,726
Munna...

313
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:16,922
Take care of him!

314
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,760
Munna! I hope he hasn't heard us...

315
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,895
Wait... Munna!

316
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,940
Dyw dyw dyw... Put a sock in it!

317
00:30:44,366 --> 00:30:46,613
Munna! Wait!

318
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,023
Munna!

319
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:55,912
Munna!

320
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:59,583
Munna! Stop!

321
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,836
Munna! Open the door!

322
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,362
For God's sake, open the door!

323
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,350
Munna! Please open this door...

324
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,611
Okay... I'm giving your touchscreen mobile to someone else.

325
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:31,200
What'd you hear?

326
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,623
Nothing... Just the baby crying...

327
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:36,076
Don't lie...

328
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:39,026
I -- I can't...

329
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:42,390
Why'd you run away if you didn't hear anything?

330
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:51,677
I thought you'd ask me what I was doing if you caught me...

331
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:55,155
You've heard it, haven't you?

332
00:31:55,906 --> 00:32:00,494
Munna... Please, for God's sake, forget everything.

333
00:32:00,494 --> 00:32:10,241
If you didn't, you may slip in your innocence at the wrong time... I'd be disgraced in everyone's eyes...

334
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,906
Please...

335
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:21,850
Mehek...

336
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:30,596
You're my master, but if I had to have a sister... It'd be someone like you...

337
00:32:30,596 --> 00:32:40,052
I just love your smile... I don't want anything to wipe it off your face... Ever...

338
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,496
And... My touchscreen mobile?

339
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,640
I haven't unpacked my things. You'll get it in the morning.

340
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,966
Hup horsey...

341
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,940
My boy...

342
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,010
See this.

343
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,287
Here.

344
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:02,440
Look here...

345
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,535
Daddy!

346
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,681
Daddy...

347
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,603
It's you!

348
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,340
Thank you for the address.

349
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,913
Don't mention it. I'll call her, okay?

350
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,613
Okay.

351
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:43,454
Mehek! Someone for you at the door.

352
00:34:43,454 --> 00:34:45,204
For me? Are you sure?

353
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:49,008
Yeah. This way.
-Thanks.

354
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,700
What's your problem?

355
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,686
Y -- You...

356
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,869
Wha -- Me?

357
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,030
No... I meant...

358
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:11,583
Who told you I have a problem?

359
00:35:12,015 --> 00:35:19,356
No one needs to tell me. Your cheap monkey tricks scream 'GODAWFUL PROBLEM' in capital letters!

360
00:35:19,356 --> 00:35:22,645
Kill me if you will, but don't call yourself godawful.

361
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:23,630
What?

362
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,636
How dare you call me godawful?

363
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:29,304
Just -- How dare you?
-God forbid... I'd die before I say that!

364
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:31,977
God forbid... I'd die before I say that!

365
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:36,490
You said I have a godawful problem...

366
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,466
And my problem... Is you...

367
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:43,043
So, as in, indirectly...

368
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:46,890
Please shut up! I mean -- Shut up!

369
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:52,621
It ain't no monkey tricks! I'm just telling you my problem.

370
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:59,061
I was the bookish type. I used to be tranquil, calm, and relaxed...

371
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:03,010
Until I saw you...

372
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,793
Now, I've started failing...

373
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:10,832
I'm restless...

374
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:13,640
Craving...

375
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,280
Looking at you...

376
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,984
I realise it's you I crave...

377
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:26,867
As I look into your eyes, I find the same old tranquility.

378
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:29,317
I've got this beautiful problem...

379
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:30,877
Shut up...

380
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:35,527
Just shut up!
-I hold you in the highest regard.

381
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,310
And... I love you.

382
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,614
No...

383
00:36:47,614 --> 00:36:50,420
Don't say anything just yet...

384
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,306
I'll be in the foyer tomorrow.

385
00:36:53,306 --> 00:36:55,582
I'll be waiting outside.

386
00:36:55,582 --> 00:37:05,660
Draw the curtain in slow motion, look down, and smile...

387
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:11,200
I'll take it as a yes and shake a leg like there's no tomorrow.

388
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,275
Shanzay!

389
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,014
You b --

390
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,610
Shanzay!

391
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,067
Where are you running? Wait!
-Hey! It wasn't me!

392
00:37:25,067 --> 00:37:28,063
Wait! Lemme tell you!

393
00:37:28,063 --> 00:37:29,990
Mehek!
