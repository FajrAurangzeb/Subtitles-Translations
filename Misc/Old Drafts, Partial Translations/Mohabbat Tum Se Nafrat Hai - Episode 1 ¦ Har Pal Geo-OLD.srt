1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:15,780
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

2
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:30,692
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

3
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:40,301
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

4
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:50,660
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

5
00:01:55,163 --> 00:01:57,052
Mama... Who is she?

6
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:04,072
Who -- Who's speaking English?

7
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:10,488
Sorry Nano...

8
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,135
Hmph...

9
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,245
Hmph!

10
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:18,004
Ammi Begum, please take your medicine.

11
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:31,671
You ask her.

12
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,240
Have you called the lawyer?

13
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,819
Yes.

14
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:49,882
He'll be here by tomorrow morning.

15
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:55,475
Morning --

16
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:05,479
The bequest...

17
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,525
I've kept it in the casket.

18
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:12,701
If --

19
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,418
If the morning sun is one I get to witness, alright;

20
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:17,938
E --

21
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:24,379
Else, it is to be considered my last will and testament.

22
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:59,235
It is indeed you!

23
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,455
Your hair have turned all grey in a mere eight years!

24
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:10,066
Won't you pull me into an embrace?

25
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:15,553
Come.

26
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:29,965
Please, Ammi Begum

27
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:33,846
Don't speak English, you wastrel!

28
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,571
The rapscallion might come knocking.

29
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:03,295
Inheritance --

30
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:10,804
If he gets word that he may get a share --

31
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:14,764
Perhaps he'll pay a visit...

32
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,747
I used to think --

33
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,170
He deserves not a penny

34
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:41,908
That I should write,

35
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:47,054
'The rotter has been disinherited.'

36
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,338
Then I thought --

37
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,722
He who got his hereditament

38
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,969
But remained forever unloved

39
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,259
What has he really earned?

40
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:15,145
Ahh...

41
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,539
Why did you come to receive me if you despise me so much?

42
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:07,018
My Maheen is here...

43
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:44,608
A -- After eight long years, I'm hearing

44
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:47,704
The rathe shuffling of your footsteps...

45
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:55,507
Just like this, you used to come eagerly

46
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,260
Hying --

47
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:02,877
As if --

48
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:08,618
As if you'd trample everyone under your feet...

49
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,039
You're afraid, aren't you?

50
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:25,612
You'd have --

51
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:28,915
You'd have felt that --

52
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,505
Before your arrival --

53
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:41,598
Ahh...

54
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:51,287
Tomorrow --

55
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:56,171
Tomorrow, put up a nice game of cricket in the lawn,

56
00:09:02,357 --> 00:09:05,486
And I'll show you what it means to be vivified.

57
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:13,289
Play with whom, Nano?

58
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:26,226
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

59
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:40,669
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

60
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:50,107
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

61
00:09:50,937 --> 00:10:01,437
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

62
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,261
You smoke too?

63
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,275
Just casually, sometimes.

64
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,278
Munshi Alam,

65
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:16,885
Why have you called me?

66
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,889
Actually, Ammi Begum --

67
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:28,917
What happened to Dado?

68
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,514
She's still with us, isn't she?

69
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:32,955
She...

70
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,692
Won't be for much longer...

71
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,162
So say her doctors.

72
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,933
You cannot go there!

73
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,761
She'd die by your footfalls.

74
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:53,876
And if you do get there,

75
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:57,728
Neelam will tear your face apart,

76
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,439
Wali will hurl expletives at you,

77
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:03,450
And Suraiyya Bibi will smite you.

78
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:07,229
And all of this will be too much for Ammi Begum to witness.

79
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:11,249
Then why have you called me here?

80
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,562
For now, come inside.

81
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,529
I'll tell you at length.

82
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,980
Have some tea first; have a smoke,

83
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,370
Then I'll tell you why I called you. Come.

84
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,760
You gotten married?

85
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,255
You would have...

86
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:20,656
No?

87
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,204
How many children do you have?

88
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:29,555
Hearing about the children

89
00:12:30,306 --> 00:12:32,015
Is something that will definitely make me happy.

90
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:37,787
Where did you get my address?

91
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,018
From Jiya.

92
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,209
She was the one who told me that you now live in France.

93
00:12:53,224 --> 00:12:54,370
Where does Jiya live?

94
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,274
I asked not.

95
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,475
She didn't seem inclined to tell anyway.

96
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:04,524
So I just asked humbly where you live.

97
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,515
The will and testament shall be written down tomorrow.

98
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:14,468
Ammi Begum had, before me,

99
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,274
Written a lot in her bequest.

100
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:22,555
You'll be getting a lot.

101
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:25,145
I thought it'd do you good to come and collect it.

102
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,076
Dado...

103
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:54,740
She misses you a lot.

104
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,597
When at a loss for imprecations

105
00:13:58,306 --> 00:14:00,267
Seeking to utterly miscall somebody

106
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,086
Then

107
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,506
Yours is the name that occurs to her.

108
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,961
And when your name finally escapes her mouth

109
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,551
She hoicks to rid herself of the gob.

110
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,052
Like this...

111
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:10,316
Neelam...

112
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,495
Come, it's too late already...

113
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,430
I -- I can't fall asleep...

114
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:07,359
I feel afraid.

115
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:10,098
Alright, how about some tea --

116
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:10,598
No, no.

117
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:14,029
I just want you to be with me for a while.

118
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,218
Talk to me...

119
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,638
It would've been more proper of you to bring your wife and kids along,

120
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,939
Being all alone -- it frightens me too.

121
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:24,640
Anyways; come.

122
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,168
Photos of the kids?

123
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:41,969
I don't have kids.

124
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:48,909
No wife either.

125
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,056
I've not gotten married, Munshi Alam.

126
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,020
I couldn't bring myself to get married, Munshi Alam.

127
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:07,412
I'm not among those who can mend their broken hearts with another.

128
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,438
And I feel that the heart I broke with my own hands

129
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,000
Often becomes more alluring than ever.

130
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,197
And in such love I could never think of the trifles of matrimony.

131
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,072
And even when it did occur to me

132
00:17:34,632 --> 00:17:36,351
I heard a voice asking, "To whom?"

133
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:41,319
You tell me - Who'd I have gotten married to?

134
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:46,618
To Jiya.

135
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,384
I would have, sure.

136
00:17:59,153 --> 00:18:01,034
But there is no second option in love.

137
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:06,144
You know what I mean by 'option,' right?

138
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:18,741
There is no option of perfidy in love either.

139
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,708
One seeks company every moment

140
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,987
Not daring to contemplate separation.

141
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,018
You know

142
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,028
What Ammi Begum

143
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,113
Plans to write

144
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,679
At the very end of her will?

145
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:44,394
What?

146
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:50,295
That Waqar Ahmed

147
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:56,644
Not be permitted to either see my exanimate face or bear my pall.

148
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,977
She despises me so much?

149
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:10,466
So much affection she had for you.

150
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,491
Shall I make some tea for you?

151
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,745
By the way, I have also prepared your favourite dishes.

152
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,641
I haven't forgotten your tastes.

153
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,353
I'm not eating anything.

154
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:45,923
Alright.

155
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:50,643
I'll sit here for a while.

156
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:01,924
How is she, Munshi Alam?

157
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:04,814
When you were being sent off to England for the first time

158
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,263
I was the one to express the strongest opposition.

159
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:10,743
I had said repeatedly

160
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,753
That you'd get accustomed to being distant.

161
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:18,014
Tales of love, you'd believe, are a thing only in India and Pakistan.

162
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,546
I have seen, Waqar Ahmed

163
00:20:22,192 --> 00:20:26,892
Neither does the soil in which one has not played stick to one's feet and stop him,

164
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,813
Nor does the one leaving notice that someone is stopping him.

165
00:20:35,883 --> 00:20:38,113
The same has happened with you, Waqar Ahmed.

166
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,882
You have spent your days of romping among feringees

167
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,343
And come back here in search of love.

168
00:20:48,633 --> 00:20:49,193
But

169
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:52,093
Treacheries such as theirs don't work here.

170
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:54,833
And so

171
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,104
You lost,

172
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,185
And defeated us as well.

173
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:03,776
I asked how she is.

174
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:16,341
Her gait has slowed down

175
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,183
She speaks little

176
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:23,752
And speaks as if

177
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,732
She's afeard and unnerved.

178
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,219
Doesn't she play cricket nowadays?

179
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,856
I left my job at Kaneez Mahal five years ago.

180
00:21:40,294 --> 00:21:43,993
I retired when my son enlisted for the Marine Police.

181
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:47,125
I do sometimes visit them

182
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:48,744
I meet all of them

183
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:53,022
And meet all of them to know

184
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:54,685
That they're all fine.

185
00:21:56,186 --> 00:22:01,287
In these five years, I've seen her twice.

186
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:04,256
Greeting me

187
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:06,147
And turning away momentarily.

188
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:13,208
Has she gotten married?

189
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,573
Munshi Alam, I asked if she's gotten --

190
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,689
N -- Nano!

191
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,711
You silly girl.

192
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:46,261
Your screams beckon to everyone; For once, call out my name. Please.

193
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,250
Have you seen your face?

194
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,547
You look like a bleeding Paki.

195
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,600
Let me get hold of you, I'll tell you everything.

196
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,970
I'd die rather than you catch hold of me.

197
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:54,621
You took it so seriously!

198
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:55,848
Please go.

199
00:22:59,347 --> 00:23:00,167
Step aside.

200
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:14,472
Time to take your medicines.

201
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:15,932
May I come in?

202
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:20,292
Come in, Uncle.

203
00:24:30,412 --> 00:24:31,382
Get up, Nano.

204
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,652
Rinse your mouth.

205
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:20,401
Have your breakfast.

206
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:28,092
If you and Suraiyya come into my room for the night

207
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,467
Fear does not let you fall asleep.

208
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:38,139
You're afraid that I may be breathing my last.

209
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,719
And look at her

210
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:45,575
Slept so peacefully

211
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:49,338
As if she could ensure that would not happen.

212
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:57,990
Have your breakfast.

213
00:25:59,463 --> 00:26:00,982
I promise, Nano.

214
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,562
I won't let you breathe your last just like that.

215
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,393
Did you hear that, Dastoor Ahmed?

216
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:17,543
I ask Death to provide me respite to work on my last testament

217
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:23,624
And this numbskull's making promises that she won't let me breathe my last just like that.

218
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,026
Ask for respite from me,

219
00:26:29,567 --> 00:26:30,990
For Death never grants any.

220
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,226
Alright, give me respite

221
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:43,346
So that I can leave him his deserved share.

222
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:51,217
He inherits half my property and the entirety of my odium.

223
00:26:53,378 --> 00:27:06,497
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

224
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:20,697
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

225
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:29,949
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

226
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:41,288
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

227
00:27:43,968 --> 00:27:45,268
He's here, Nano.

228
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:50,918
He's here?

229
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,868
Where is he, Dastoor?

230
00:27:54,437 --> 00:27:55,827
Where is the varlet?

231
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:04,707
Who told you?

232
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:06,646
I don't know anything about this.

233
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,438
I know how to find out.

234
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:13,692
Whenever he comes here,

235
00:28:16,189 --> 00:28:18,228
The cacti in Nano's lawn blossom.

236
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:50,025
Sorry to hear you left your job at Dado's place.

237
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:55,189
Sorry to hear that

238
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,989
You had left everyone.

239
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:03,670
It was after you left that I realized

240
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,184
That she could go through any mishanter

241
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:10,915
And therefore, I had no reservations about retiring.

242
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,296
Honestly, she didn't feel bad in the slightest either.

243
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,763
I said to her, "I'm leaving."

244
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:19,955
And she said, "Leave."

245
00:29:23,058 --> 00:29:24,198
Today

246
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,937
The will is going to be drafted

247
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,248
I'll give you

248
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:35,139
Its signed copy.

249
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:37,886
Then, you're free to leave.

250
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:42,998
I want to meet Dado.

251
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:47,231
Rather

252
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:51,506
I want to meet them all.

253
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:55,412
I suggest

254
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,875
That you should not meet them.

255
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,395
Dastoor Uncle will slap me, right?

256
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,554
And Aunt will tear my face apart?

257
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,495
And Aunt Mehru?

258
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:21,338
What'll she do?

259
00:30:25,447 --> 00:30:27,089
She'll be derisively wounding.

260
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:33,093
I'll take that slap,

261
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:37,916
Take those curses,

262
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:44,871
But I'm not leaving without meeting Dado.

263
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,020
Now

264
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:52,739
The doors of Kaneez Mahal are locked for outsiders.

265
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,283
When a stranger knocks,

266
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,956
The servants ask,

267
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:03,917
"Who are you?"

268
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,049
"Where do you come from, and"

269
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,706
"Whom do you want to meet?"

270
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:14,580
The servants have been shown your photograph

271
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:19,423
And instructed that this man is not to be permitted inside.

272
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,174
Then why are they giving me a share of the property?

273
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:33,870
This, too, is an expression of their disgust,

274
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:38,580
Or is it perhaps that you are no longer capable

275
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:40,599
Of being despised?

276
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:43,568
Therefore

277
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:48,373
Every connection of yours with Kaneez Mahal

278
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,586
Ends with this will.

279
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:54,270
Oh God!

280
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:58,385
Ammi Begum had said the same thing when she got to know of your departure.

281
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:02,600
"Oh God!"

282
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:09,532
And her voice reflected the same torment.

283
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,624
You're not crying, are you?

284
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,080
No.

285
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:23,300
Surely not.

286
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,026
You're on the rack.

287
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,281
Everyone was on the rack that day,

288
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,018
Weeping.

289
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,525
You don't know the circumstances that made me leave.

290
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:45,589
They don't either.

291
00:33:50,756 --> 00:33:52,382
And I guess I can't even explain now.

292
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:04,123
Why are you smiling?

293
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:10,545
The story you're concealing so hard

294
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:13,838
Is etched on the walls of Kaneez Mahal.

295
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,169
Everyone's read it

296
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,842
Everyone's heard it.

297
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:25,132
What?

298
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,727
So everyone knows what happened that day?

299
00:34:31,006 --> 00:34:33,351
Yes, everyone knows it.

300
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,142
So was it wrong on my part?

301
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,600
Should I not have left?

302
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,697
This question of yours

303
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:52,419
Won't be answered by anyone else.

304
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:56,418
When leave this time, you'd start asking yourself

305
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,508
If you should have gone there.

306
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,476
And if you ever return,

307
00:35:02,922 --> 00:35:04,479
You'd say to yourself,

308
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,692
"No, I should not have left."

309
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,463
The will is being drafted there.

310
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:21,307
I've been called as a witness.

311
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:22,648
I'm leaving.

312
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:24,472
I'll be back before lunch.

313
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:54,782
What are you doing?

314
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:32,059
