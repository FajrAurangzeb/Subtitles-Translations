1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She must've given some reason.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking you not to come so suddenly...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum, she didn't say anything...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just said, 'Don't come'.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know there is a lot you'd rather not speak out

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or share with anyone.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look,

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell me if there's any problem.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can go to any length for your happiness.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish I'd kept quiet about this one, too.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I'd not told you about this wish of mine, I'd not have been embarrassed before you today.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum, I'm right.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you about my wish without thinking of Dad's dream that you worked to realise all these years,

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which you'd chosen me to do, without thinking for once

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it could affect that dream.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know that my happiness was hollow on the inside.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you thinking that way?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something could've compelled her to do this.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, in a few days --
-That won't be necessary, Mum.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please confirm my ticket.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham,

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was possible to talk to Uncle and explain it to him.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd said all of it in anger.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get it, Suboor.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad's vow was based on his trust.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His pride stands on that trust.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't snatch his pride from him.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Ashir?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you forget him?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll try.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't promise it.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you punishing yourself and Ashir, mate?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try to convince Uncle for once.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've accepted this punishment happily.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham --

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham --
-Enough, Suboor!

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't give me any new hopes.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it really hurts when things go south.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was just provoking you.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have sworn such an oath in a fit of rage.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've not just sworn an oath, Shakira,

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have all the courage to honour it.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why... I didn't tell you anything last night,

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought -- once your anger cooled down --

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not about anger, Shakira,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not one bit about anger.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If they can fall so low in accusing my daughter,

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I, too, can stand so tall in her defence.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here, ol' chap!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help me pack my things.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You put up quite the act.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're very hurt.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You really love her.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen you this way before.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan, it doesn't always happen

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That we get

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What we wish for.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get everything that I wish for.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you make it possible.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't say that, mate.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's good that you've come. There's a lot for you to do.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me,

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd take good care of Mum and Appa Bi in my absence.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always told you that you're a kid,

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm saying today that you've grown up.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be at ease over there

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be at ease over there because you're here.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me, too,

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd be happy.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Likewise.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa Bi, remember to take your medicines.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You remember your promise, right?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever would he have stayed here for?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've broken his heart.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called him many times, but he didn't answer.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did he talk to you?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's left to talk about?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You surrendered too quickly, Reham.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only you wanted --

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only you wanted --
-I had no choice but to surrender, Suboor.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, who were involved in this conflict?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir on one side,

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir on one side, and Dad on the other.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No matter the victor, I'd lose.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, don't be disheartened.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Things may get better with time.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked Fesl to talk to Ashir.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope it'll resolve it.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Suboor,

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody will talk to Ashir.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not you, not Fesl -- Nobody!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing's going to change.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing's going to be right now.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what was destined for us.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish I could help...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've tried your best, haven't you?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm bound by family traditions, Suboor.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One prays rather than do something for my kind.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this, Sofia?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You saw Ashir off with such rapture,

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, in just a few hours,

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with all this gloom?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am a bit sad.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not because he's gone,

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But thinking

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of how he'd left so griefstricken.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir was so delighted.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was you who'd agreed to go to that girl's place rather unexpectedly.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why did she do that?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To our Ashir, at that,

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's uncompromisingly selfless in love!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa, do you remember

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back when I'd gotten married to Reza,

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir was just 14.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was very tensed

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over whether he'd accept me as his mother.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he accepted me wholeheartedly.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave me respect,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't even think of me as a stepmother.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what Ashir's like.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's that girl who's the unfortunate one

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To have broken Ashir's heart like that.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get all worked up.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just have faith

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the Lord has willed it this way because it's for the better.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Appa, I have to go to Adan's school tomorrow morning.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be leaving early.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what fresh exploit I'd be hearing about tomorrow!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't hear about any exploit. I'll rouse you early in the morning, alright?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Catch some sleep.
-Good night.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up, Mum? You woke me up so early...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd gone to bed so late...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad's not well.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to the shop; I've had a hard time stopping him.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told him, 'Rest for now, Ahmed will run the shop'.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to Dad?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever could happen?

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember the scene your Uncle and Aunt created?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His blood pressure's shot up ever since!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Uncle and Aunt made a scene here, and you didn't even tell me?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only you stayed at home, you'd know!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you sitting here?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and get ready. I'll get you some breakfast.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham,

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not t --
-He won't be coming.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left the country forever.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me see Dad.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe this is his result.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Sofia,

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this is Adan's result.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just cleared one subject. At just the passing marks.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not that he's not smart or inefficient, but I think he gets distracted and loses focus.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He really needs someone to make him sit down and study.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sophia, I'd suggest you send him to a tuition academy.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, I'm afraid his result would suffer in the final exams.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what guarantees that he'd study at a tuition academy when he doesn't study at school?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you hire a home tutor?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe, that way, he'll not get distracted.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That may not be a bad idea.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think that might work.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know anyone,

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe someone from the school, or his class teacher might offer him tuition at home?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not possible.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out school policy does not allow class teachers to tutor their own kids outside school premises.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the contact information of an academy that provides home tutors.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm pretty sure they'll be able to help you.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My pleasure.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really appreciate this.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has it come down?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's better,

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But still high.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't stress yourself.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm telling him - it's just how Rehmat and Parveen are.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're just looking for an excuse to create a scene.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that does not mean

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That one be hurt over their words and sicken oneself.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't give two hoots about what they say!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not worried about anything they say.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But yes,

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever they said that day

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has certainly

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pained me a lot.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But right now,

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just worried about the shop.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Dad?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you worried about it?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear,

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The earnings have come down, and we're spending a lot.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Electricity bills,

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This and that,

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plus, there's a lot of those departmental stores in the city now.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People have stopped coming to the shop.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only His Royal Highness were capable of anything

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'd be there to help me!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just that?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've made me so capable, haven't you?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can help you.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I've applied already.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd get a job offer very soon.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There she goes again!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adamant about getting a job, now.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyon --
-Should we stop breathing out of fear of what everyone would think?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do we do?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They have to object to every single thing.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Everyone'!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, Dad.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't applied to a company.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've applied as a teacher.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, why not?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Start working.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Teaching children is such a noble deed.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now,

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ever get worried if anyone said anything.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd take care of that. I'm right here.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I allow you to work.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad and Daddy's girl have united

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Against this outsider.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it, my dear, let me deal with that.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her say what she wants to.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, get some rest.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's good, isn't it?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you like the place?

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Mum.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's perfect.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The house is nice, too.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me,

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is everything alright?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, everything's alright.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd say you rest for a few days.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to go to the office right away.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum, there's no chance. No chance I'm having a tutor!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Behave yourself, Adan.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you seen your results?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you attempt your exams this way?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia,

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have your dinner, and talk to the kid calmly after that.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's a joke to him, Appa.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know how much I've been embarrassed because of him today?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum,

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd study on my own, I promise.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't trust you Adan.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not this time.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm hiring a tutor,

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're studying under him.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least have your dinne --

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness, Sofia.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he'd study on his own.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, he's left his dinner.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd come and have it when he's hungry.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't be emotionally blackmailed by him.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have to be stern with him for his good.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, can you hold on for a minute, please?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, please...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please give me her number.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call her right away.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, thank you.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
5 p.m.?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of that.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of that.
-Sorry, Appa.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've come,

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I have an important meeting today.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I say I'd take care of everything? Don't worry.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Adan to behave.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I got one complaint, he's grounded. No PlayStation, no going out, nothing.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't come to that.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like the lad's so insolent...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, goodbye.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's so far away!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How would you commute?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By rickshaw, Mum, of course.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when would you be back?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be around 8.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please ask Ahmed

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To leave me at the stop.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd thumb a ride.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it, Mum?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go with your sister and help her get a rickshaw.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes,

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If there's anything,

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to call your Dad or your brother.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's alright, Mum,

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you'd worry like that,

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be very tensed.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't be able to focus on my work.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not riding to battle.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm waiting outside. Come quickly.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care. Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mum.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm searching for the number but can't find it.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how it is with you.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw the cigarette away; she's coming.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. I'll be back.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to, Ahmed?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh...

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham has to go to teach.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was helping her get a ride.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's going to teach?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, as a home tutor?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't Uncle's income enough for you folks?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir,

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if you don't poke your nose in our matters.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if your matters aren't our matters.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or is it that Uncle's decided to cut himself off from the family?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and talk to the rickshaw driver.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me be clear,

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like it one bit tha --

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like it one bit tha --
-I don't give a hoot what you like or don't.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes,

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're as good as cut off from the family,

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because they've never bothered to ask about our condition,

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the hardships we face.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, it'd be better

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you open your eyes before opening your mouth.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before we start, let me make it clear, sir:

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're here, thinking that you'd scold me and be stern with me,

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can turn back and leave right now.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neither would I scold you, nor would I punish you.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm --

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, I thought --

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit. I'll have tea sent.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, I'm Adan.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there he is, right in the middle of the street, saying,

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there he is, right in the middle of the street, saying, 'Isn't Uncle's income enough for you folks that Reham's going to work'?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say I didn't warn you.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, Rehmat would be coming in the evening to create a ruckus over it.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's going with my permission.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm her father.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better stay quiet.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to say anything.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One jibe of Munir's has awakened your sense of honour,

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you aren't ashamed one bit over why

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham has had to help me when you're there!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, make yourself so capable

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you can proudly have her live a respectable life, staying at home.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the bleedin' limit,

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calling me from the shop for this cod.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And listen,

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't bother her by calling!

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's strange.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to hear both the jibes and the lectures!

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, when do your exams start?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next month?

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which subject do you find the most difficult?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd start our revision with that.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Revision?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're talking about revision. I haven't even covered the syllabus.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen,

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't want to ruin your teaching career,

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should leave.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's an honest advice,

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because there's no way I'm going to pass.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what if I said that I like challenges?

444
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,971
One can only taste victory

445
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,663
When one's afraid of defeat.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Subject?

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Accountancy.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a good start.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're regular like this,

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you'd get excellent results.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that an order?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a request.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you at 4 tomorrow.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodbye.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That lippy cow!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, why wouldn't she be?

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her father's always backing her!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad,

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been too soft with Uncle.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're older than him,

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare he reject this proposal?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I beg before him for your sake?

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not going there again and again only to be insulted!

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better stay quiet.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd say you talk to him, Mum.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might jump off the roof one of these days.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M -- Munir!

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear!

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't study and look at her at the same time, mate.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't feel like she's teaching.

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It feels like she's reciting poetry.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at her hair and smile, mate.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's beautiful...

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
However did you get her number?

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, 'however'?

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maria gave me herself.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me,

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Miss Maria'.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can call her Maria.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's my friend.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact,

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More than a friend.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lost it.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, you folks must find it odd,

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm seriously

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm seriously involved.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Involved'?

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 4, mate. Time for my game.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 4 already?

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm getting late, folks, see you!

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with him?

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with him?
-No idea.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan would bother you like this.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan would bother you like this. But please, don't give in and stop coming.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's a good boy.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A tad irresponsible...

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry,

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't stop coming here.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late...

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God you've come.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, start your session. She's been waiting for long.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright? Very good.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was with my friends, so...

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a bit late.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of which, we're friends too, aren't we?

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if we spent this time together from now on.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't study with my 'friends'.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right...

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But some friends are a bit different, too, innit?

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I find it all so boring.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to make sure you don't find it boring at all.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get my books.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa was praising you so much!

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's so good!

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She deserves every bit of it!

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's quite the accomplishment that

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's accepted you.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're going to score good grades, okay?

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hopefully, if the Lord wills, he will.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your handwriting's so horrible.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't understand a word of this.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate Urdu.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Writing is so hard...

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't even that hard.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bit of practice will help.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd say you keep a diary.

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Diary...

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what'd I write?

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever your heart feels like.

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The point here is to write as much as you can,

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that you can improve your Urdu handwriting.

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm nearly done with my papers,

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd leave by next month.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you alright?

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've started teaching,

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So time flies.

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh...

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fesl had talked to Ashir, too.

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd said --

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor,

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was working on my notes.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call you -- in a while.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's my

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First packet.

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been a month since she started teaching.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time just went by!

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your hard-earned money, my dear; you have the greatest right over it.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I do with it?

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it with you.

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it with you. Get something for yourself.

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've worked so hard

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To educate me,

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if --

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I want to help you today,

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't turn me down like that.

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd feel like all my efforts have gone to waste.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --
-Please, Dad.

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've always felt pride and happiness in every achievement of mine,

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So why not this time?

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or is it that a daughter's earnings are an issue of ego

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you as well?
-Not at all, my dear!

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think of that! Here.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were my pride,

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And so you shall always be.

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, now, you are my vainglory.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May you live long.

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These ill-timed showers!
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They just bring ill health!
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've taken a day off.

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could it have hurt his studies?

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're brilliant, I give you that.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This rain only brings diseases.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
