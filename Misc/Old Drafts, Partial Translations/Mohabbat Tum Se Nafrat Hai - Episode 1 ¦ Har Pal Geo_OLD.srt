1
00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:16,529
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

2
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:31,170
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

3
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:40,169
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

4
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:50,959
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

5
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,360
Mama... Who is she?

6
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:04,651
Who -- Who's speaking English?

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,020
Sorry Nano...

8
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,674
Hmph...

9
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,691
Hmph!

10
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,520
Ammi Begum, please take your medicine.

11
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,980
You ask her.

12
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:41,662
Have you called the lawyer?

13
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,490
Yes.

14
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,421
He'll be here by the morning.

15
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:55,802
Morning --

16
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:06,120
The bequest...

17
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,309
I've kept it in the casket.

18
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,379
If --

19
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,100
If the morning sun is one I get to witness, alright;

20
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,897
E --

21
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:25,108
Else, it is to be considered my last will and testament.

22
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,720
It is indeed you!

23
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:06,839
Your hair have turned all grey in a mere eight years!

24
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:10,540
Won't you pull me into an embrace?

25
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,890
Come.

26
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,530
Please, Ammi Begum

27
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,659
Don't speak English, you wastrel!

28
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:57,400
The rapscallion might come knocking.

29
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,080
Inheritance --

30
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,299
If he gets word that he may get a share --

31
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,809
Perhaps he'll pay a visit...

32
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,430
I used to think --

33
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,320
He deserves not a penny

34
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,383
That I should write,

35
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,309
'The rotter has been disinherited.'

36
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,380
Then I thought --

37
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,900
He who got his hereditament

38
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:07,039
But remained forever unloved

39
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,379
What has he really earned?

40
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,490
Ahh...

41
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,450
Why did you come to receive me if you despise me so much?

42
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,779
My Maheen is here...

43
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,800
A -- After eight long years, I'm hearing

44
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
The rathe shuffling of your footsteps...

45
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:56,259
Just like this, you used to come eagerly

46
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,039
Hying --

47
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,859
As if --

48
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:09,840
As if you'd trample everyone under your feet...

49
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,460
You're afraid, aren't you?

50
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,550
You'd have --

51
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,300
You'd have felt that --

52
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:33,819
Before your arrival --

53
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,170
Ahh...

54
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,980
Tomorrow --

55
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,450
Tomorrow, put up a nice game of cricket in the lawn,

56
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,840
And I'll show you what it means to be vivified.

57
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,830
Play with whom, Nano?

58
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:26,959
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

59
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:41,239
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

60
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:50,739
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

61
00:09:50,829 --> 00:10:01,789
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

62
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,780
You smoke too?

63
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,919
Just casually, sometimes.

64
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:10,940
Munshi Alam,

65
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,800
Why have you called me?

66
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:25,899
Actually, Ammi Begum --

67
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,779
What happened to Dado?

68
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,119
She's still with us, isn't she?

69
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,789
She...

70
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,959
Won't be for much longer...

71
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,709
So say her doctors.

72
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,089
You cannot go there!

73
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:50,850
She'd die by your footfalls.

74
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,869
And if you do get there,

75
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,319
Neelam will tear your face apart,

76
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,602
Wali will hurl expletives at you,

77
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:03,969
And Suraiyya Bibi will smite you.

78
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:08,320
And all of this will be too much for Ammi Begum to witness.

79
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,899
Then why have you called me here?

80
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,009
For now, come inside.

81
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,839
I'll tell you at length.

82
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,040
Have some tea first; have a smoke,

83
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,989
Then I'll tell you why I called you. Come.

84
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,470
You gotten married?

85
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:18,910
You would have...

86
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,250
No?

87
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,810
How many children do you have?

88
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,851
Hearing about the children

89
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,150
Is something that will definitely make me happy.

90
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,500
Where did you get my address?

91
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,250
From Jiya.

92
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,900
She was the one who told me that you now live in France.

93
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,910
Where does Jiya live?

94
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,975
I asked not.

95
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,190
She didn't seem inclined to tell anyway.

96
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,196
So I just asked humbly where you live.

97
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,510
The will and testament shall be written down tomorrow.

98
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:15,210
Ammi Begum had, before me,

99
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:19,133
Written a lot in her bequest.

100
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,440
You'll be getting a lot.

101
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,390
I thought it'd do you good to come and collect it.

102
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,800
Dado...

103
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,456
She misses you a lot.

104
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,096
When at a loss for imprecations

105
00:13:58,096 --> 00:14:00,907
Seeking to utterly miscall somebody

106
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,060
Then

107
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,040
Yours is the name that occurs to her.

108
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:10,380
And when your name finally escapes her mouth

109
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,721
She hoicks to rid herself of the gob.

110
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,270
Like this...

111
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,710
Neelam...

112
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,261
Come, it's too late already...

113
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,210
I -- I can't fall asleep...

114
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,870
I feel afraid.

115
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,000
Alright, how about some tea --
-No, no.

116
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,940
I just want you to be with me for a while.

117
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:16,982
Talk to me...

118
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,699
It would've been more proper of you to bring your wife and kids along,

119
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,319
Being all alone -- it frightens me too.

120
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:25,120
Anyways; come.

121
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:39,939
Photos of the kids?

122
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't have kids.

123
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:49,530
No wife either.

124
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,590
I've not gotten married, Munshi Alam.

125
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,019
I couldn't bring myself to get married, Munshi Alam.

126
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,759
I'm not among those who can mend their broken hearts with another.

127
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,479
And I feel that the heart I broke with my own hands

128
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,140
Often becomes more alluring than ever.

129
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,852
And in such love I could never think of the trifles of matrimony.

130
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:34,310
And even when it did occur to me

131
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,289
I heard a voice asking, "To whom?"

132
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,575
You tell me - Who'd I have gotten married to?

133
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,090
To Jiya.

134
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:55,867
I would have, sure.

135
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:01,960
But there is no second option in love.

136
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:07,019
You know what I mean by 'option,' right?

137
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:19,680
There is no option of perfidy in love either.

138
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,650
One seeks company every moment

139
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:30,330
Not daring to contemplate separation.

140
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,610
You know

141
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:36,137
What Ammi Begum

142
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:39,740
Plans to write

143
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:42,299
At the very end of her will?

144
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,430
What?

145
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,070
That Waqar Ahmed

146
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:57,890
Not be permitted to either see my exanimate face or bear my pall.

147
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,280
She despises me so much?

148
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,680
So much affection she had for you.

149
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,350
Shall I make some tea for you?

150
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,400
By the way, I have also prepared your favourite dishes.

151
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,199
I haven't forgotten your tastes.

152
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,790
I'm not eating anything.

153
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,239
Alright.

154
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,399
I'll sit here for a while.

155
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,720
How is she, Munshi Alam?

156
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,490
When you were being sent off to England for the first time

157
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,000
I was the one to express the strongest opposition.

158
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:11,019
I had said repeatedly

159
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:14,389
That you'd get accustomed to being distant.

160
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:18,760
Tales of love, you'd believe, are a thing only in India and Pakistan.

161
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:22,020
I have seen, Waqar Ahmed

162
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,269
Neither does the soil in which one has not played stick to one's feet and stop him,

163
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,489
Nor does the one leaving notice that someone is stopping him.

164
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,639
The same has happened with you, Waqar Ahmed.

165
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,729
You have spent your days of romping among feringees

166
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,459
And come back here in search of love.

167
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,400
But

168
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:53,193
Treacheries such as theirs don't work here.

169
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,142
And so

170
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,933
You lost,

171
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,920
And defeated us as well.

172
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:04,991
I asked how she is.

173
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,230
Her gait has slowed down

174
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,750
She speaks little

175
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:24,071
And speaks as if

176
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:28,642
She's afeard and unnerved.

177
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:33,641
Doesn't she play cricket nowadays?

178
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:40,033
I left my job at Kaneez Mahal five years ago.

179
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,410
I retired when my son enlisted for the Marine Police.

180
00:21:45,496 --> 00:21:47,671
I do sometimes visit them

181
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:49,241
I meet all of them

182
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:53,166
And meet all of them to know

183
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,086
That they're all fine.

184
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:02,050
In these five years, I've seen her twice.

185
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,269
Greeting me

186
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:07,150
And turning away momentarily.

187
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:13,589
Has she gotten married?

188
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,860
Munshi Alam, I asked if she's gotten --

189
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,190
N -- Nano!

190
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,901
You silly girl.

191
00:22:42,973 --> 00:22:46,210
Your screams beckon to everyone; For once, call out my name. Please.

192
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,331
Have you seen your face?

193
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,540
You look a bit boorish and skint.

194
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,502
Let me get hold of you, I'll tell you everything.

195
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:52,700
I'd die rather than you catch hold of me.

196
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:55,049
You took it so seriously!

197
00:22:55,117 --> 00:22:56,535
Please go.

198
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,361
Step aside.

199
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,039
Time to take your medicines.

200
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,750
May I come in?

201
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:20,690
Come in, Uncle.

202
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,420
Get up, Nano.

203
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,010
Rinse your mouth.

204
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,981
Have your breakfast.

205
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,439
If you and Suraiyya come into my room for the night

206
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,229
Fear does not let you fall asleep.

207
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:38,729
You're afraid that I may be breathing my last.

208
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,332
And look at her

209
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:46,199
Slept so peacefully

210
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:49,789
As if she could ensure that would not happen.

211
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:58,532
Have your breakfast.

212
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,430
I promise, Nano.

213
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,171
I won't let you breathe your last just like that.

214
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:13,126
Did you hear that, Dastoor Ahmed?

215
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:18,032
I ask Death to provide me respite to work on my last testament

216
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:24,109
And this numbskull's making promises that she won't let me breathe my last just like that.

217
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,680
Ask for respite from me,

218
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,830
For Death never grants any.

219
00:26:35,373 --> 00:26:37,583
Alright, give me respite

220
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:43,993
So that I can leave him his deserved share.

221
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:51,883
He inherits half my property and the entirety of my odium.

222
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:06,739
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

223
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:20,690
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

224
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:30,019
<i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i>

225
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:42,079
<i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

226
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:46,049
He's here, Nano.

227
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,390
He's here?

228
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,290
Where is he, Dastoor?

229
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,774
Where is the varlet?

230
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,323
Who told you?

231
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,589
I don't know anything about this.

232
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,100
I know how to find out.

233
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:14,371
Whenever he comes here,

234
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,040
The cacti in Nano's lawn blossom.

235
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:50,859
Sorry to hear you left your job at Dado's place.

236
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,630
Sorry to hear that

237
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,850
You had left everyone.

238
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,053
It was after you left that I realized

239
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,930
That she could go through any mishanter

240
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:11,310
And therefore, I had no reservations about retiring.

241
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,649
Honestly, she didn't feel bad in the slightest either.

242
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,239
I said to her, "I'm leaving."

243
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,850
And she said, "Leave."

244
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,401
Today

245
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,181
The will is going to be drafted

246
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,960
I'll give you

247
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:35,780
Its signed copy.

248
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,721
Then, you're free to leave.

249
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,440
I want to meet Dado.

250
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,370
Rather

251
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,950
I want to meet them all.

252
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,959
I suggest

253
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,319
That you should not meet them.

254
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,859
Dastoor Uncle will slap me, right?

255
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,269
And Aunt will tear my face apart?

256
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,051
And Aunt Mehru?

257
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:21,949
What'll she do?

258
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,830
She'll be derisively wounding.

259
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:33,519
I'll take that slap,

260
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,620
Take those curses,

261
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,290
But I'm not leaving without meeting Dado.

262
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,321
Now

263
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,240
The doors of Kaneez Mahal are locked for outsiders.

264
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,539
When a stranger knocks,

265
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:02,659
The servants ask,

266
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,319
"Who are you?"

267
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,300
"Where do you come from, and"

268
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,629
"Whom do you want to meet?"

269
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:14,839
The servants have been shown your photograph

270
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:19,799
And instructed that this man is not to be permitted inside.

271
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,790
Then why are they giving me a share of the property?

272
00:31:31,154 --> 00:31:34,404
This, too, is an expression of their disgust,

273
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:39,035
Or is it perhaps that you are no longer capable

274
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:41,204
Of being despised?

275
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:44,145
Therefore

276
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:48,734
Every connection of yours with Kaneez Mahal

277
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,119
Ends with this will.

278
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,470
Oh God!

279
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,580
Ammi Begum had said the same thing when she got to know of your departure.

280
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,110
"Oh God!"

281
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,340
And her voice reflected the same torment.

282
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,720
You're not crying, are you?

283
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:21,280
No.

284
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,649
Surely not.

285
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,890
You're on the rack.

286
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,279
Everyone was on the rack that day,

287
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,400
Weeping.

288
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:41,529
You don't know the circumstances that made me leave.

289
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:46,069
They don't either.

290
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,912
And I guess I can't even explain now.

291
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,420
Why are you smiling?

292
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,220
The story you're concealing so hard

293
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,680
Is etched on the walls of Kaneez Mahal.

294
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:17,210
Everyone's read it

295
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,159
Everyone's heard it.

296
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,109
What?

297
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,869
So everyone knows what happened that day?

298
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,750
Yes, everyone knows it.

299
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,920
So was it wrong on my part?

300
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:44,520
Should I not have left?

301
00:34:48,941 --> 00:34:50,799
This question of yours

302
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:52,500
Won't be answered by anyone else.

303
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,870
When leave this time, you'd start asking yourself

304
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,880
If you should have gone there.

305
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,831
And if you ever return,

306
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:04,725
You'd say to yourself,

307
00:35:04,725 --> 00:35:08,910
"No, I should not have left."

308
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,949
The will is being drafted there.

309
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,529
I've been called as a witness.

310
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:22,810
I'm leaving.

311
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,119
I'll be back before lunch.

312
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,190
What are you doing?

313
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,550
