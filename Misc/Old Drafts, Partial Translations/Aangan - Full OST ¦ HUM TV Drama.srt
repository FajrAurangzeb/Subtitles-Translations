1
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:14,111
<i>My eyes are filled with nectar</i>

2
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:10,553
What will you do after your F.A.?

3
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:11,594
B.A.

4
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:12,937
And then?

5
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:14,111
A job.

6
00:00:17,378 --> 00:00:18,205
That's it?

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,603
Nothing else?

8
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:22,406
Hand over my first paycheck to Mum and --

9
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:24,976
Your tea's getting cold.

10
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:30,264
<i>I've lost myself</i>

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:36,295
<i>The shadow of love falls on the courtyard of my mind</i>

12
00:00:36,295 --> 00:00:41,829
<i>These days and nights don't while away</i>

13
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:47,204
<i>For you have robbed me of all serenity</i>

14
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:47,510
Your love changes like the seasons!

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,484
<i>Thus I sacrifice myself before you</i>

16
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:51,054
I have begun to despise love!

17
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,807
Not love; you despise me.

18
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,159
<i>My mind pirouettes, my body pirouettes</i>

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,893
<i>In the guise of love, woe pirouettes</i>

20
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:00,706
<i>He who falls in love pirouettes every moment</i>

21
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:03,600
<i>He who falls in love pirouettes every moment</i>

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,290
<i>My body pirouettes</i>

23
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,043
<i>My mind pirouettes</i>

24
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:11,901
<i>My body pirouettes</i>

25
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,869
<i>My mind pirouettes</i>

26
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,968
Behold! With what artful beauty the sorrowful secret conceals itself

27
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:20,755
The arrow has struck my heart, behind the curtain the bowman conceals himself!

28
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:26,265
<i>These eyes speak the truth</i>

29
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:31,630
<i>These eyes have never seen someone like you</i>

30
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:37,538
<i>These eyes speak the truth</i>

31
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:42,334
<i>These eyes have never seen someone like you</i>

32
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:47,726
<i>Days and nights I have spent wide awake</i>

33
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:54,289
<i>For separation from you has devours me like poison</i>

34
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:59,944
<i>Thus I sacrifice myself before you</i>

35
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:04,867
<i>Thus I sacrifice myself before you</i>

36
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:03,705
I have never loved you!

37
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:05,015
But I have!

38
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:07,703
<i>My mind pirouettes, my body pirouettes</i>

39
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:10,465
<i>In the guise of love, woe pirouettes</i>

40
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:13,329
<i>He who falls in love pirouettes every moment</i>

41
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,234
<i>He who falls in love pirouettes every moment</i>

42
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:21,987
<i>I've lost myself</i>

43
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:27,438
<i>The shadow of love falls on the courtyard of my mind</i>

44
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:33,203
<i>I've lost myself</i>

45
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:38,797
<i>The shadow of love falls on the courtyard of my mind</i>
