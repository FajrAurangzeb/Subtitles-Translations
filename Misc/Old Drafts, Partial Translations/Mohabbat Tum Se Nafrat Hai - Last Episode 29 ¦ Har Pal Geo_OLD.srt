1
00:01:51,627 --> 00:02:03,977
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

2
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,092
This duty of showering flowers and saying prayers ends today.

3
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:24,653
I'm not coming after today, Gulrez.

4
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,952
The treasure you'd held in your possession for four years

5
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:34,393
Which you'd been safeguarding for four years

6
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:39,482
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

7
00:02:42,613 --> 00:02:44,084
Your debts

8
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,233
Are thus cleared

9
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,324
As is my gloom.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to be brave.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take me along, Wali.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to come.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm not one who'd listen

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Neelam is not generous with happiness.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How you'd said

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He's my brother too'?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he is not, why had you said it?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the car out.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's donned the same gown

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same song is playing

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same beautician has been called

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To deck her up.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't hesitate in speaking it now, Fajr.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lack the strength to stand up against English!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you quiet today?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think today?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you feel it's a love marriage?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked me to close your eyes again,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I closed my eyes and opened them.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told me a joke again

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'What was that'?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got delighted when you finished with the make-up quickly again.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm laughing every so often again.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you haven't asked again,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Is yours a love marriage'?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The second time, it's just a marriage

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a love marriage.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't add much to my sorrow

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But had you been here, it'd have felt as if

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've not lost eight years.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know what it's like here?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's quiet...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if struck by a thunderbolt, as if afraid

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the groom may run away again.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, mate.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough of it.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're calling.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remembered something.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really afraid.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not afraid, you're just embarrassed.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, buddy!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who brought this Foxy?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dado said that the procession must be led by this Foxy.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we go!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You departed then and are arriving today.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wretch, you swallowed up eight years.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring the bride.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and sit by the priest.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go forth with the marriage now that you've arrived.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else will you have for memories?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the evil gaze not touch you.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thrown his sherwani here like rags.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And left you this letter addressed to you.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never wished that you be defeated by my hand.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I feel like leaving you bitterly defeated today

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Having shown you that if you want to win in the name of love

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to accept defeat, Maheen.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Begin the marriage rituals, Reverend.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall I start, my child?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With five million rupees' worth of dowry

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is, in the presence of these witnesses

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hereby sealed.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With five million rupees' worth of dowry is, in the presence of these witnesses

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hereby sealed.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why I'm thanking you?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen such a beautiful bride.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You did it for me.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And also because

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't let me remain a loser

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I needed seven runs to win on the last ball

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He played a no ball,

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you hit a six on that.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've won, Maheen.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the winner.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost so many times in life

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I know how those who lose feel.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Winners never think

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of what those who lost go through.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lost.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But nobody knows

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he used to win.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why did he lose today?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that does not mean

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's perfidious.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His love for you is no less

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Than your disrelish for him.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'll come one day.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll wait for him.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, too, shall you.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'll wait for him.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sleep outside.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're exacting your ultion.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you, no.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just safeguarding.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've kept you with me as a treasure

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll keep you safe.

149
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,207
Good night.

150
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:39,876
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

151
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:51,537
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

152
00:23:52,601 --> 00:24:02,122
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

153
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:11,525
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

154
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:16,622
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

155
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:34,783
Go, my boy.

156
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:38,013
Your trials end here.

157
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:50,023
Best of luck.

158
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:12,529
Why are the lights turned off?

159
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,392
Don't you want to see me as the groom?

160
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,639
Alright, let it be so with you.

161
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,250
Close your eyes.

162
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,262
But I want to see you.

163
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,870
I'm turning on the lights.

164
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:44,261
Maheen

165
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,001
Maheen!

166
00:26:06,001 --> 00:26:07,398
Stop right there, Waqar Ahmed!

167
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,699
Right there -- Standing before me --

168
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:29,634
Like -- a criminal in a witness box...

169
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:42,846
Suits you well.

170
00:26:53,064 --> 00:26:54,493
Nano says,

171
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:58,134
'Waqar Ahmed'

172
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:03,075
'Looks like a groom even in casuals'.

173
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,767
Scared, eh?

174
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,461
Yes.

175
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,615
I'd warned you

176
00:27:39,106 --> 00:27:40,806
I'll finish you off

177
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:46,149
Where there's not the slightest relief for you.

178
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:55,319
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

179
00:27:55,635 --> 00:28:05,038
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

180
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,758
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

181
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,736
Ma --

182
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,266
Ma -- Maheen!

183
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:05,521
Dado!

184
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:09,588
Dado!

185
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:11,758
Dastoor Uncle!

186
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:19,145
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

187
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:28,408
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

188
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:38,908
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

189
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,503
Maheen!

190
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:36,449
Maheen!

191
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:37,522
What happened?

192
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:38,479
Maheen!

193
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,338
Go and get a doctor!

194
00:28:40,338 --> 00:28:41,229
Go!

195
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:42,619
Maheen! Open your eyes!

196
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,499
What have you done, Maheen!

197
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,889
Maheen! Open your eyes!

198
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,621
She's gone, Dado...

199
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:18,811
They're --

200
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,451
They're just trying -- to no avail...

201
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,662
When she says,

202
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,681
'I'd finish you off',

203
00:30:41,922 --> 00:30:44,234
She does so indeed.

204
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:51,693
And when she says,

205
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:54,892
'I'll die --'

206
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,823
She dies...

207
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:17,864
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

208
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:31,174
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

209
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:43,860
As she left --

210
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,376
She --

211
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,216
Left me this letter.

212
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:03,693
Should I read it out, Dado?

213
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,373
Yes...

214
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:10,680
Read it out.

215
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,752
Waqar Ahmed,

216
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:41,392
You're scared, aren't you?

217
00:32:52,103 --> 00:33:01,345
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

218
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:10,942
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

219
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:20,272
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

220
00:33:20,272 --> 00:33:29,832
<i>I will remember you then</i>

221
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:26,912
Surprised, aren't you?

222
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,522
I sacrificed myself to surprise you.

223
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:31,802
Tell me -

224
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:35,192
Why did you not read the diary this time?

225
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:37,463
I'd even asked you to.

226
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,776
You felt embarrassed.

227
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,287
You felt ashamed.

228
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:45,305
Tell me -

229
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,455
When you ran away from the marriage

230
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:52,236
Did you not feel any step of the way that you were doing something wrong?

231
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,556
Didn't you feel ashamed any step of the way?

232
00:33:57,475 --> 00:33:59,695
You just saw my handwriting,

233
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:08,096
But failed to see your name etched in my eyes,

234
00:34:10,345 --> 00:34:15,826
Failed to see that detestation had given way to love,

235
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:20,191
Failed, also, to see

236
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:23,329
How I'd surrendered before you.

237
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,815
Don't leave, Waqar...

238
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:36,467
I beg you.

239
00:34:41,908 --> 00:34:45,008
You went, trampling the girl

240
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,518
Who'd already accepted her defeat underfoot.

241
00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:00,614
Turned out to be your usual Londoner tramp.

242
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,909
Fell in love

243
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,559
Without knowing how to be in love.

244
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:14,960
Now that I'm dead, don't think

245
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,819
That I've exacted my vengeance.

246
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,519
I've just shown you

247
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,340
That the one you love,

248
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,780
You should have faith in them;

249
00:35:26,893 --> 00:35:29,954
Else, in ceremonies of espousal, every boy gets a girl

250
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,283
Who needs to love?

251
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:35,014
Do you know

252
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,805
I have one thing to thank you for.

253
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:41,464
When Gulrez died four years ago,

254
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:49,176
I used to think

255
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,696
Why I still dragged on.

256
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,825
But he was right.

257
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:58,425
You came back at last.

258
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:02,846
Coming to know of it,

259
00:36:03,337 --> 00:36:05,538
I was enlivened again.

260
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:24,358
For before my exit, I had to be vivified for once.

261
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:33,108
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

262
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:43,719
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

263
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,459
Seeing your smile on the day of the wedding

264
00:36:51,472 --> 00:36:54,282
Took me back eight years to my happiness

265
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,670
On hearing about my marriage.

266
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,679
You were separated from me in the same happiness then,

267
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,039
And in this happiness, I am from you.

268
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:11,439
Interesting coincidence, isn't it?

269
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,049
You'd felt then that I don't deserve you,

270
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:20,880
I felt now that you don't deserve me.

271
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,364
The truth, Waqar Ahmed,

272
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,304
Is that those who plead for love with rue

273
00:37:29,258 --> 00:37:31,454
Do not deserve it.

274
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:48,099
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

275
00:37:48,905 --> 00:38:02,103
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

276
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:11,403
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

277
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:22,580
<i>The heart is its maker, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

278
00:38:28,794 --> 00:38:31,703
Should, after I'm gone, the woe of separation excruciate you,

279
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:34,645
Tell people miserably,

280
00:38:36,243 --> 00:38:38,814
That this eternal affliction of yours

281
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,497
Is a trifle before mine in that one moment

282
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:46,964
That struck me when I got the news that you'd left.

283
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,613
From what you did to me

284
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:55,893
I leave you absolved,

285
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:58,757
But I wonder as I depart

286
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:02,698
Who will give you shrift for your sin

287
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:05,147
Because of which

288
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,008
For eight years

289
00:39:07,218 --> 00:39:10,028
I had grown to despise love?

290
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,468
I had told you, Waqar Ahmed

291
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,999
When it comes to ego, Maheen Aurangzeb can be far more ruthless than you.

292
00:39:23,814 --> 00:39:25,270
I'll finish you off

293
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,990
Where there'll not be the slightest relief.

294
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:58,200
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

295
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:09,560
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

296
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:19,080
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

297
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:28,440
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

298
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:37,860
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

299
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:52,020
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

300
00:40:52,225 --> 00:41:01,440
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

301
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:10,830
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

302
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:17,781
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart.</i>

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
