1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We pray to our Lord, Jesus Christ...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank You for all the years we shared with her...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your father was a good man.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He respected beliefs.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loved his family.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He couldn't live without them...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he was willing to leave everything to stand by me.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gave you the name I liked - Maria.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maria... The daughter of Abdullah...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

11
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,990
Everything was alright...

12
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,430
Yeah...

13
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,527
That's how it felt...

14
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:18,733
Before...

15
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,062
It wasn't...

16
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,967
You must promise me...

17
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:48,675
You will do as I say.

18
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,604
This is our promise...

19
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,045
And the Lord God Himself bears witness...

20
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:13,150
Sometimes, you got to leave everything...

21
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,390
For those you hold dear...

22
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,659
Even if they were never yours...

23
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:29,560
Sometimes, you just have to accept things as they unfold...

24
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,670
Whether as the sliver of light cutting through the endless night...

25
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,700
Or the nightmare that comes back to haunt you...

26
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,033
I'm going because I've accepted everything...

27
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm treading this long and tiring road...

28
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,248
Weary...

29
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:52,328
But holding on to every bit of courage left in me...

30
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,740
Strange, how they...

31
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,880
Leave this world in peace...

32
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,240
Leaving you in a web of promises...

33
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,130
Sometimes, you have to take a step...

34
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,360
To find yourself...

35
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,130
That's what you're doing today.

36
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,020
Taking a step.

37
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,450
Going where you should've been...

38
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,223
But were never...

39
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,499
Keep it with you...

40
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:23,433
And if you ever feel lonely...

41
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:27,115
Know that I'm with you...

42
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,370
You'll find me right by your side when you need me.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
