2
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,310
Gonna see Nisha!

3
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,020
She's not taking my call, her phone's off! I want to talk to her!

4
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,460
It's 2 a.m.! She'd be sleeping right now! You want to go <i>now</i>?
-Chuffin' right now! Lemme see who's got the bloody guts to stop me!</i>

5
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,340
You're off your head! Always up to something! That's the blasted limit!
-My love knows <i>NO</i> limits!</i>

6
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,180
I'm keeping that.
-Gimme the keys, Ammar!
-For God's sake, Danish...

7
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,540
Please don't go there... You'll lose Nisha forever...

<i>He alone is Lord thine</i>

10
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:01,432
<i>He alone is Lord mine...</i>

11
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:08,669
<i>He alone is Lord thine</i>

12
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:14,890
<i>He alone is Lord mine</i>

13
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:22,060
<i>'Tis for another day</i>

14
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:30,680
<i>That our paths ne'er entwine</i>

15
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,992
<i>Why dostn't thou see through the blur</i>

16
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:44,953
<i>Creation in its endless beauty</i>

17
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:51,400
<i>He that looked on Him found succour</i>

18
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,914
<i>But 'tis for another day...</i>

19
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:09,388
<i>O Lord...</i>

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

21
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,170
Know what... I always wanted to have a daughter...

22
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,210
But the Lord gave me two sons...

23
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,874
He did what was best...

24
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:09,130
If I had a daughter, she'd by my best friend.

25
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,110
Of course...

26
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,630
A mother can be her daughter's best friend.

27
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,500
My Mum was mine...

28
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,860
But now...

29
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,008
I'm all alone...

30
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,340
So...

31
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,685
How say we be friends?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

33
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:26,547
Please don't grieve yourself over what they say... They can only give you grief...

34
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:32,229
Care about them, but not about everything they say...

35
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:36,314
We can't change the world...

36
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:40,000
But only... How we see it...

37
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
