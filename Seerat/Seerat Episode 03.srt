1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
foo

2
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,130
Welcome home, dear.

3
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,269
Here. Come in.

4
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,810
Make yourself at home.

5
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,059
Dad...

6
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,467
Wait, Dad!

7
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,616
Dad...

8
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Dad! Dad!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

10
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,283
Here.

11
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:58,483
I've got this for you.

12
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:03,930
A dress just like this one. I'm sure you'd love it.

13
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,025
How do you know us so well?

14
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:10,399
I mean... First time we've met...

15
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:18,818
I don't know much about you...

16
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:23,908
But I've heard Mum and Dad talk about you.

17
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,370
Dad always talked about you...

18
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,999
Missed you...

19
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,155
All of you...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

21
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,042
For you...

22
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,364
Keep it...

23
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,864
We don't need your gifts.

24
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:50,071
I'd brought it with love...

25
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,704
I would've been happy if...

26
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:57,493
You accepted it...

27
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:05,107
Well, if you care about <i>our</i> happiness, why don't you just leave? Why'd you even come here at all?</i>

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

29
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,329
I don't even think she's a Muslim! Just look at the book she's got...

30
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:32,703
Who?

31
00:26:34,512 --> 00:26:37,520
Abdullah's daughter, of course!

32
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,239
What book? I don't get it.

33
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,015
Whatzit... 'Babel'?

34
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:50,584
Bible?

35
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:53,509
Yeah. That.

36
00:26:53,857 --> 00:26:59,224
I've been restless since I saw it! Something's not right!

37
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:02,307
What's the big deal?

38
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:08,390
The Bible is the holy book revealed to Jesus Christ...

39
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:12,287
She probably got it from her mother.

40
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:17,219
But why does she have to keep it?

41
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,940
Why do you have to keep your mother's jewellery?

42
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,744
They're all that's left of her!

43
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,396
Well, maybe that's all that's left of <i>her</i> mother...</i>

44
00:27:29,396 --> 00:27:32,770
You don't get it...

45
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,250
She's not one of us!

46
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,645
Just look at her name!

47
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,815
This... Ignorance is not really your fault, Sajida...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

49
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,979
What?

50
00:36:25,055 --> 00:36:26,828
Scared?

51
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,384
So it's <i>you</i>!</i>

52
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,956
Maria... The one they've all been talking about...

53
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,797
Gotta say... Until I saw you, I almost didn't believe you'd be so...

54
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,052
Gee, mate, I'm your cousin!

55
00:36:52,052 --> 00:36:53,955
Sumair.

56
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:56,676
Ring a bell?

57
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,909
No.

58
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:02,380
Not even remotely.

59
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,430
I'm sure we can fix that...

60
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,536
You're staying here...

61
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:14,493
No way we won't see each other 'round here!

62
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:22,164
Well, guess what, I don't care about random lads on the street.

63
00:37:22,164 --> 00:37:27,681
Which is where you're wrong... All the chicks do.

64
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:33,635
That's how you think... Who knows what <i>they</i> may be thinking...</i>

65
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,934
As lovely and captivating as yourself...

66
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:43,070
I like the way you talk.

67
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,359
Makes coming here... Worthwhile... Thank you...

68
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,371
Thank you for giving me a reason to stay here...

69
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,080
See ya...

70
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,750
Real soon...

71
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,070
