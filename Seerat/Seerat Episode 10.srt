foo

2
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,650
Not so fast...

3
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:18,878
D'you think this is a blimmin' inn... A hotel that you can leave and come back to anytime you want? Eh?

4
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:21,015
What've you been up to all night?

5
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:24,568
What d'you mean? I was at work.

6
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:29,023
I told Kanwal...

7
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:33,318
Yeah, she told me...
-I'm not talking to you.

8
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,208
I'm asking <i>her</i>.</i>

9
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:46,013
Feel free to blame me all you want... But not now. I'm honestly knackered. Can't take another earful.

10
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:52,238
Blimey... You're rude, I give you that!

11
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:57,624
If my daughter dared say that, I would've cut her tongue out!

12
00:32:57,624 --> 00:32:59,473
Done?

13
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:06,345
This is my place, young lady. Never forget that.

14
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:11,766
No one dares come and go without my will.

15
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:17,046
If you've got a problem, be my guest and find somewhere else.

16
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:18,893
Mhm hmm... Anything else?

17
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:23,342
I'm dead on my feet... Need to get some rest. Could you please wrap it up a bit quicker?

18
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,720
Blimey, you're bigly balky!

19
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,576
Thank you.

20
00:33:31,265 --> 00:33:38,308
Good Heavens! So insolent and uncouth! The blimmin' savage!

21
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,089
Well, what do I care... It's gonna be the end of you!

22
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,238
She's gone, Mum! It's okay, Mum!
-Like, seriously, d'you think I'd care?

23
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:46,559
Shut up!

24
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,860
Back to work! C'mon!

25
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:54,030
What next? Clean the whole place?

26
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,111
I don't see why not!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
