1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told her?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't say it?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't come to university today.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've called her.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her phone's off.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry... You can talk to her tomorrow.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me to her place tomorrow.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her myself.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell her your truth.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This fear of losing her won't let the truth come out of your mouth.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be hurt I didn't tell her the truth.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This fear shows your love. I'll tell her about it.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell her that I believe I can give her every comfort in life.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who believe in love never covet any other comfort.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's calling. You're going over to Salma's.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've severed one tie, but it's not like they're nobody now!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma's not well... Just pay her a visit. A short one?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why can't you go? She's your sister!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a headache. I can go with Munni some other day.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you send her? She'd be oh-so-eager to go there!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't try to have your way every time!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look. It's not like Aunt'll be pleased to see me. It just ain't no good.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.
-Hello. Come in.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum said you're not well?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, in the morning. I'm good now. I'll get you something.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Not in the mood.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit. Asim's coming any moment. He's gone to drop a guest.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Well, Aunt, that depends on the - uh - guest. Innit?</i>

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's his colleague, and she was checking on me.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His colleague... With him for hours, I'm sure.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Blimey, he's got some proper nice female *ahem* colleagues. Comin' here, gettin' cosy and all, I mean.</i>

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, she's proper nice. He's proper nice too.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why, Aunt, I tell you to keep an eye on him.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen her with him before.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's with him everyday. At the office.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme get this straight. She used to be with him at the office... And now she's with him in his car. Making progress, I see!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sent Asim with her. It's nothing of the sort.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It better be nothing of the sort, Aunt.</i>

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Because I won't take nothing of the sort.</i>

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can take his sister's refusal but not my son getting in the car with someone!

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called to tell you I'm not going to university tomorrow.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you ask why?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming with Mum to your place.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me you're not delighted!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, Malika... I wanted to tell you something...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you so much...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're all I want in my life...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'd be hurt to hear it, but...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me my protein shake. Quick.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm no billionaire, Malika.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's the maid at this mansion.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I live in the basement with Mum...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I promise you, I'll give you every comfort in life, fulfil every wish you have.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're there, aren't you?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you aren't angry with me...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit! Why'd I be angry with you? Talk to you later. Bye.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
B --

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told her, Mum!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About our visit?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what I never told her...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... She didn't say anything?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so worried she'd be angry. She didn't even mind it one bit!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?
-Yeah.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell Atif when I go to get the keys from him.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'd want to come along too!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need to tell Atif about it.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to take him along?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to show off how close you are to a rich guy? You twit...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that, Mum.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... No need to tell him.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And no need to borrow his car. Your bike would do.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bike?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who rides a bike to his bride to-be's?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No problem! We can get a taxi!

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mum... She lives so far away...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have to be so kind.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she could come so far, I'm sure you...

106
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,192
I don't like it when my colleagues come here.

107
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,632
You didn't have to invite her.

108
00:08:56,632 --> 00:09:01,552
But I will. I just love her. She's almost family.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Aqil think? I told him I'd be back soon.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care about what he thinks now.
-But I do.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's seen me with Sana. Who knows what he'd think!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what he thinks.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'm worried.
-Why should we?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't keep mourning Malika's rejection!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum... Don't take her rejection so seriously.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be mad. The deed is done. And you better take it seriously if you're not.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to think of something for you.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Atif.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, mate...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't go to university today.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm taking Mum somewhere...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't hide it from you...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm taking her to your sister-in-law would-be's.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt didn't tell me...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum said she'd introduce you to her once everything's decided.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The driver will be here any moment. You can take my car.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your first visit to your in-laws. A bike just won't do it.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Atif, I don't --
-Just do as I say.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yeah, he'll get you some sweets.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry about anything.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Atif.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm taking Mum to your sister-in-law would-be's.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going somewhere?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit. We need to talk.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, go on.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan and his Mum are coming today.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan and his Mum?

145
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,600
Didn't I tell you they're not welcome here?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just stop it!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe you're saying that! I mean, what'd Aunt and Asim think?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim and Salma know very well that Malika won't give in.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika said that?

153
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:29,189
How dare she? She wants a piece of me!?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil! Calm down!
-I can't!

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's calling a stranger here and you're stopping me!
-What's the big deal?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if they're just like Malika thinks they are?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's an idea.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meet them all you want. I don't even want to see their face!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're her brother.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only man in the family.

161
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:58,784
You've got to meet them.
-Well, then, don't complain if I said something real bad!

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're our guests. I know you won't.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're her brother.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What don't brothers do for their sisters?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you stay here for a while? For her?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I will. Happy?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's good that you told her everything.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have no worries now... No regret.
-Of course.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to win me my love today.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's happiness would be as dear to her family as my happiness is to you.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wish me luck!

174
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,558
I swear... Noriyan looks lush.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm glad you know there's someone better than Asim here.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. And, blimey, look at his car!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought some sweets too! As if Mum's already said yes!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan said he's not going back until she does!

179
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,036
He sure means business!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me do this.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's Mum is so excited to see you!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me get the tea...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go. Mum's calling you too. I'll take care of everything.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, but I'm setting everything on the tray.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! I ain't even that bad!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my only son. I always wanted someone humble and civil for him.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're too kind...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They usually look down on anyone below them.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Below them'?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well -- It's very kind of you -- to come to a small-town family like ours...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't your daughter tell you?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Mrs --

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... Meet Mum.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's get going, Noriyan.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?
-What happened?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you leaving?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure your daughter can fill you in.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Mum?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, Noriyan. Right now.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --
-Hey! You can't just go like that!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think it's funny, eh?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it's a mistake! I'll go talk to Mum.
-Aqil!

203
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,777
You're the maid's son?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Malika. I told you last night, remember?

205
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:00,465
Out!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

207
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:08,666
If I saw you trying to see or talk to my sister again, I swear I'll put you down!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get going already!
-But --

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is going on?
-Satisfied?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy now?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy to see him?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What in the blazes is going on? Malika?

213
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:29,287
What the devil is going on?

214
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,837
I don't wanna know!

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked something, why aren't you telling me?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you do that?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like her.
-No way.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're lying. Something feels off.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd tell you if it were anything else.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then, why don't you like her? One reason?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you tell me why you like her? Just one reason?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love her... And love needs no reason!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, there's no reason to reject her.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just know that you can't marry her.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know if you like anyone else. I can go see her.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if she, too, is like Malika, know that you've got no option but Ashi.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with Malika?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may be blind to her brash and brazen eyes, but I'm not.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? What've you seen in her eyes in a few seconds?

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't get it.
-That's why I'm asking you!

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't make you understand!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's so unfair, Mum!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you think a mother could ever be unfair to her son... So be it.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't accept it!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just ask her if she'd marry you.

239
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:51,043
Why's your blimmin' phone off, Malika?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now... No need to cry...

241
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:19,076
Let her cry all she wants, Munni. Let her sentence herself!

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please, Mum...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll do you good.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her cry all she wants. You won't have to wipe her tears every now and then.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe they actually did that!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder what pushed them, really...

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it because his Mum rejected you, or because the rich guy of your dreams turned out to be the maid's son?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The maid? What do you mean?

249
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:02,488
It's a rip-off! His Mum's a maid!

250
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,658
How do you know if Noriyan never told you?

251
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,868
She's the maid at my class-fellow's... I saw her in a picture.

252
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,765
Fair enough...

253
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:21,574
But how did she recognise you the moment she saw you?

254
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:33,625
Well... She's the maid. No problem. She works hard to earn something.

255
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:40,975
But, Lord... She must be a seer or something!

256
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:43,766
And how is that?

257
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:49,956
One look at you and she was like, 'My son deserves much better'!

258
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:53,005
Just... Wow!
-Mum!

259
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:57,426
It's your karma coming back.

260
00:21:57,426 --> 00:22:01,356
What goes around comes around.

261
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:06,015
Someone gave you the big E just as you did!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww... Easy...

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not fair. You should talk to Uncle.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've decided already.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you'd talk about our marriage the moment Novera gets here.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think of this engagement as the first step?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who gets engaged these days?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Novera's got you head over heels for her for real.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you wanted, too, Mum.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted you to marry Novera. Not be so crazy about her.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, just talk to Uncle.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't talk to him.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's talked to Novera about it.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he think if I insisted?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're not talking to him?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't look nice. He'd think I can't wait!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thank you. I'll talk to Novera myself.
-Hey! Wait!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord, he's crazy...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Atif...

281
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:51,176
Hey... Blimey, man, you're stone-cold!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd be the first to hear the good news.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, Atif...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... Who'd miss me now?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I want to talk to your Mum.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?
-Yeah. Let me congratulate her.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Wha --
-Why, you're getting married, of course!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It didn't really go as planned...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum didn't like her.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll talk to her. Convince her.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif called...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To congratulate us...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told him I didn't like her.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told him.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He asked why.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell him if he asked me.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever... Your Mum's wise...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure there's something that made her reject the love of your life.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know her too!

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?
-Malika, remember?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The girl I did that play with?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's a fantastic girl.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm saying! Do you think Mum should've rejected her?

311
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:24,283
Aye... I don't get it either...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please talk to Mum, will you? She listens to you!

313
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,654
Noriyan! Just when I was looking for you!

314
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:40,154
It's not like I'm lost or something!

315
00:26:41,214 --> 00:26:44,238
But keep at it and you risk losing me!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's really serious about her.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The halfwit...

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you accept her if she's good?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because she isn't.

320
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:15,166
He says she's a real beauty.

321
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:23,187
He doesn't know that others have their hearts set on the beauties.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you haven't told him why you rejected her.

323
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:43,325
I don't want to drive a wedge between you.

324
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:49,075
It's best if we kept it to ourselves.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should've been cross.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I wonder why you are.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you talk to Mr Atif about Malika?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted him to convince you.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just who is he?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd he feel for you?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He calls me his brother!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's an ocean of difference between calling you a brother and being one!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always speak against Atif!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have until tomorrow morning. Do you need time or should I tell your Uncle?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I love Malika!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one can take her place in my heart!

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Ashi can, once she's in your life.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's everything your Malika isn't!
-So what?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's everything for me!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's nothing for me!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to get married to her? Over my dead body!

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I'll never be happy without Malika.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I know is you'll never be happy with her!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll hurt you, I'm sure...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more than you rejecting her?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't deserve someone like her! Just try to understand!

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do we deserve,

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the one we love?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea how much one-sided love hurts, Noriyan!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes...</i>

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think she doesn't love me?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could see all her love shatter when she found out you were the maid's son!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she found out you were not the rich lady's son as you told her...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she found out you were just the lowly maid's son!

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you couldn't see it...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If --

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if --

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if Malika confessed her love before you?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you still have a problem?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about me, she won't even confess her love before you!

367
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:32,307
Sometimes, you gotta take a chance...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd send her off right now if I could have my way!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?
-That's the problem!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe he's panting for someone else after getting engaged to Malika!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone else?
-You heard it.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She works with him and she's started paying them visits!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen it myself!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Salma?
-She knows everything.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says she's just Asim's colleague. But...

379
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:41,228
I smell something shady!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma wants to make Malika her daughter-in-law.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I've seen Asim's love for her.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika doesn't care for any of that...

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll suffer all her life! I tell you!

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought Malika's refusal would make Salma budge.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've got me worried.
-There's only one way out, Mum.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to Malika. Get some sense into her!

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll suffer all her life if she didn't listen!

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep an eye on her.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make sure she doesn't talk to Noriyan again!

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even talk about him.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you take my call?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to have anything to do with you!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're asking me!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't Mummy tell you?
-What'd she say?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika --

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing left for me to say.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say Malika's love for Noriyan died when she found out who he was!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika, I told you about it!

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even try it. I'd never love a maid's son!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just forget me!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you crazy? How could I --

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan, I guess?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even mention his name!

408
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,838
Blimey, that's some real hatred. I thought you said your heart beats to the sound of his name!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You here to rub salt in my wounds?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted to ask you if you actually loved him or --

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I took everything because I loved him!

412
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:43,870
Lemme get this straight - your love bugged out when you found out he's the maid's son.

413
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,152
Shut up or you won't like what I do to you!

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway. I told you Asim's so nice... But you hurt him.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt called just now. Told he's been promoted.

416
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:00,041
To the dickens with him.

417
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,393
After all that's happened?

418
00:37:03,393 --> 00:37:10,544
Well, newsflash! Mr Goody Two-shoes has already given someone else my place in his life!

419
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:12,294
No way!

420
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:16,524
If you can't believe it, sweetie, go and ask Aqil. He'll tell you everything.

421
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:20,954
I'm sure he's mistaken. Asim ain't that sort!

422
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:23,745
Honestly? I'm delighted.

423
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,706
Good for him.

424
00:37:25,706 --> 00:37:31,136
In fact, go and congratulate him for me, will you?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
