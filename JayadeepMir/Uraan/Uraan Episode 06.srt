1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did Noriyan lie to me if he knew her so well?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One should only fly as high as his wings can take him.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I tell you I can't carry on like this?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may not know it, but there's others here who have hopes from you.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I waste my life living up to their hopes?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And grow restless?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, then...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll just think I've only got two daughters.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't want to worry you.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like it when you object to everything I say.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody's told you, perhaps, but a mother's got the right to object.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he say?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same old. He just doesn't see sense.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Have your lunch.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows when Malika will be back.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her friends, Munni.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She isn't back yet. I'm so worried.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Rabia.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Minahil. Malika's sister.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she's...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sleeping. She was unwell.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's unwell?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika didn't go to university today.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where could she be?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let Aqil hear you.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't Malika back yet?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She gets late sometimes.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The traffic, you know.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But her class is over at 2.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 4.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only you cared!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, get her out of university. She better stay home.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something seems off.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sisters are best sent to their homes.
-What's stopping you? Get to it.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get to it'?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Aunt to take her 'pearl' with her quick as she can.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd they say if I sent her empty-handed?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Her father may have died, but his mother and brother didn't give her anything'.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just fix the date. Everything else will be okay.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how? It's not like the angels will come to our help!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mum, always so hopeless!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I tell you there's still time.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll stop telling you when I'm hopeless.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's something I need to talk about...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you actually cross with me?

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know you'd mind it so much.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't feel embarrassed.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to tell you my side of the story.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I respect women a lot.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I respect you a lot.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know that women are generally forced by fate to work.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't have liked it it you'd paid the bill.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, as a colleague, it was my duty to pay the bill.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you understand.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understood it already.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take Farah so seriously. I don't feel bad about it at all.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For caring.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Thank you'?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What for?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For spending time with me.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to spend my life with you, mate.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, I long to live that life...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, when do I bring Mum?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm back!
-'Evening.
-Bang on time!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your bus ain't normally so late.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know the bus route.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't I always back around now?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you always wear so much makeup?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Makeup?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, it's just a spot of lipstick... A friend put it on me in the bus...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't going to university again, Mum.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go in, Malika.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell him, Mum... I don't want to drop out!

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll complete my Master's!
-Be my guest.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact,

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be Asim's guest!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no problem with that.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See that?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something's off, I tell you. Get her married ASAP.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of a mother are you, really?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mothers shield their daughters.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil mouths any guff he wants!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's his problem?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know about him, but I have a problem with you.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme guess. Your sister sends her greetings.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing from her.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got a sign from the Lord.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the daughter didn't go to her home this time, there's no way I can't lose face.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Aqil's been slagging off behind my back!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly... Where were you?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even try to lie. You didn't go to university.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd gone over to Rabia's. Her Mum's not well. I thought I'd meet her.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me to her in the evening.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should see her.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? You're still doubting me, Mum?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because Rabia asked us where you were.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how you're rewarding my trust?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so worried, Mum? I was going to tell you...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After slipping away with him, maybe, never to come back?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Mum! What are you saying?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's so nice!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He even wants to meet you!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the first time I've slapped you, Malika. You'd do well to remember it before talking about him again. And try, if you can, to feel the pain.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care. Go.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to talk to you about something...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you thought about Noriyan's marriage?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have, but...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him finish his education first.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get a job...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No worries. I'll get him a job somewhere once he's graduated.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Uncle's got two daughters. Both homely and comely.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm sure he won't like either of them.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you guess, sir?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never really talked about it, but it seems you're right...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kids these days... It's better if you talk to them.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get to know what they want.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What he wants?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did he tell you something?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not really...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've never talked about it, but I'm sure he'd have someone...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Mum. 'Evening, Atif.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Evening.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back early?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd talk to your Mum while you're hanging out with friends... Nothing special, really.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk about what?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dropping a dime on me?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was talking about your future.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you would've clicked hundreds of selfies today. Show me, will ya?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't take a single picture...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never mind, then...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look tired. Get some rest.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you doubt Noriyan?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, not at all...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just talk to him.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if he didn't tell you...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can always check his phone...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it'll tell you everything he won't!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how to check these phones and all...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do. Feel free to give me.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather die than live like this...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you say that?

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're such a fighter!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't give up just like that!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's got problems...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We just have to figure out how to deal with them...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want me to do?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm tired of explaining myself.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want to live in that shack.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got sisters who'd like it their way... And Mum!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got a problem with me all the bleedin' time!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you can support them even if you're not living with them...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know if I should say it...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you can shift here. Use whichever room you want. No issues.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They look at our relationship

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wrong way. Get it?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think it'd reflect too badly on me

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I came over here?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's stood by me like you.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our relationship isn't so complicated.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who cares what they think?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We know better.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure we're close enough to share everything with each other.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care what they say.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It may be okay in your society.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm not okay with it.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I don't want to stand in your way.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather we don't talk about it.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Have your coffee?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great, Faizan! You should've told me!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like this surprise one bit.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We could've helped you!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas and I will be there. To see Novera.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright. We'll be coming.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where to? You seem so happy! What's up?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very happy.
-What happened?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Novera tell you when she's coming?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She's always into 'surprising' me!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surprise, then!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're here!

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me! Really?
-Yes! Yes!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Uncle just called.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are we waiting for? Get ready, we're leaving!

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seem more eager than me!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because why not?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she refused?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's smart.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm smart too, okay? Why would she refuse?

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows I like her.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Let's get ready. Let's go.
-Okay. I'll call her, okay?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you found out!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey... Yeah, found out!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite the surprise, believe me!

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do what I say. You better take me seriously.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and I are coming. Okay?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great! See you!

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See ya!
-Bye.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurry up, Mum!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, how does she like Pakistan?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely, Aunt.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like home.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's just one problem.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The traffic! So wild and confusing!
-Ah, yeah!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, they jump the light when they feel like and nobody bats an eyelid!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get used to it.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she was so worried. The rush is mad and all of that. And I was like, 'You'll get used to it'...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, you'll get used to it.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you warned Waqas to stay quiet or...?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Nothing like that...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we'd start if you're done complaining.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just complaining since you've been here!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I'm so sorry. I didn't know you're so patriotic.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, ma'am, I am a proud Pakistani. Always have been.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, Mr Proud Pakistani, how's the business going?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's fine, Uncle.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pray you become a successful businessman like your late father.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I'm trying, Uncle, but I don't think I'm really coming up to Mum and Dad's expectations... Which is why I sometimes get roasted.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please call me the next time you scold Waqas, Aunt. I'd love to see it!

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I've had enough. How say you take up this responsibility?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'll become a great businessman like his father. I wish you all the best, m'boy.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, that's some support at last... Let's pray...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, Novera, he's very excited to see your work.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear you've featured this house in a magazine?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aunt, I didn't have it featured. They picked it themselves.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They all know interior design's my passion.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, let me show you around.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got to talk to him first.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can see you've got a lovely taste.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Aunt.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you show Waqas around? He loves to see your work!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure. Coming?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon. Let's go.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After you.
-Thanks.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so happy Novera likes Pakistan.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... It's good...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you know, we've got to come back home sometime...

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been so responsible since her younger days...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The home... Me... After her mother...

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll take care of everything.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed. I'm sure she'll adjust.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's so wise, so lovely.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, now check this zip...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! Did you talk to Asim?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. He said he can come and help you anytime. He'll bring his computer.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's called a laptop!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you even paying for? Don't they teach you anything at the institute?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's some things I didn't quite understand. I thought I'd ask Asim.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's so skilled. I'm sure he can help me.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, go and learn from him.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's coming here.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And no one's gonna have a problem with it. Okay?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just looking for excuses to come here.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't need excuses.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim's my son as much as Aqil.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus... I would've been better-off if you'd found a 'son' better than that pleb!

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's up to God to give wealth to whoever He wills.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's better to be poor with dignity than filthy-rich without!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep thanking Him for your dignified deprivation. As if I care.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't seen deprivation.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare think of my simplicity as deprivation.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have I ever let you starve for a single day?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, your Aunt's coming to fix the date for the wedding. You better fix that mood.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So there's no way you're getting out of this dream house.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just told Mum you can't drive in the traffic here.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me, I didn't say I can't drive in this traffic.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just saying that nobody follows the rules here, which makes it really difficult for me to drive.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I follow the rules.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All of them. By the way, you can also use it to your advantage.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's so sweet of you! But my driver's coming tomorrow.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again, ma'am. You're getting this driver for free.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I don't want a driver who talks so much.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about a life-partner who talks so much?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear the girls love partners who love to talk.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've missed one bit of it. That kinda girls don't like to hear anything except compliments!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no problem with that.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have to...

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, I never asked anyone to compliment me. I'm not the type who just loves to hear compliments.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what they're talking about, right?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've literally got no idea.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're kidding, right? Playing around with me?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can guess what my Dad could be saying about me.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got no idea what your Mum thinks about me.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What am I here for?
-Not so fast, okay?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just calm down, relax. Take your time.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask you later. I've got to explore Pakistan! There's so much I've got to do, you know!

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you doubt Noriyan?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, not at all...

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just talk to him.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if he didn't tell you...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can always check his phone...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it'll tell you everything he won't!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how to check these phones and all...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do. Feel free to give me.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, your Aunt's coming to fix the date for the wedding. You better fix that mood.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to spend my life with you, mate.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been? Mum called you so many times!

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you didn't even bother to answer! Look at the time!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need to tell you anything. Okay?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry for last night, Zoha.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving the bike and the keys with you.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't live on your favours anymore.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reza! Where's Aqil?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left last night, ma'am.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me some coffee.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the meaning of this?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here now!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean right now!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you forget what Aqil told you?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got an important class today.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going anywhere. I hope I'm clear.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you get it? I've got to go.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you. You're not taking one step out of this room. Or I'm telling Aqil.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also, Salma's coming. I told her you're home.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I care if she wants to come? I don't have to be here.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about university. You're going straight to your home.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see my phone?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you thinking?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing really... Just... What if you didn't get what you're so happy about?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you always so downbeat, Mum?

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt wouldn't have invited you for nothing.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me be clear, Asim.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not fixing the date if I caught so much as a whiff of apathy in Malika's behaviour.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika would be at university, Mum.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Aunt would've asked her before talking to you.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She's home.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Aunt told me in the morning.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. But please, don't worry.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's better that I worry now than give both of us a lifetime of worry.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, finish your breakfast. You're late.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he's human after all! He worries for you!

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure he is. Very caring, too.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And very loving, innit?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, c'mon...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say you talk to him. Because he won't have a clue unless you told him.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'd sense my feelings if he's destined for me.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way he's sensing your feelings.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll look you in the eye but fail to read them!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's always lost within himself!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.
-'Morning. (He's here!)

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like a cup too, Asif.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, this colour suits him so much!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he wouldn't even have thought about it! Gee, Holy Joe's so boring!

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Definitely not boring.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I love about his personality. He just goes about his work.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough! But don't you think he should worry about those who just can't go about their work and can't remember a thing? It's been half an hour and you haven't given me the file!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me a minute. I'm working on it.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your lawyer called in the morning, sir.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about the model who had started working for Event 4 while contracted by us.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants to withdraw her complaint and negotiate with you.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you think I wouldn't know?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd tried to make her understand, but she didn't, and...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shot herself in the foot by working for another agency while contracted by us.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lawyers, the media... They've only reviled her all this time.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No surprise, after what she did.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some models think they're the best after one or two ad campaigns.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't know what's coming. She didn't know what's coming.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly. Who knows what's gotten into their heads! Girls these days, I tell you!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Mujtaba to get ready for the shoot.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, sir.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
