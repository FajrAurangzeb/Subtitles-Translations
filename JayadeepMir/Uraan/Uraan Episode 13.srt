1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at the timing! We got here at the same time!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Been waiting for me?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back after ages.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've missed you so much.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Same here.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were busy every second.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I wanted you to come with me. You could see how busy I was!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think, Zoha? I didn't want to come with you?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it were up to me, I'd spend every moment of my life with you.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what always draws me to you.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I think... How can you even love me so much?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you make me want to live...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You make me feel important, valued...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel special.
-You are special.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very special.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what kind of moron would not love you.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The shopping -- Was fabulous.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you went shopping?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Just a bonus.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, blimey, the trip was so productive!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... By the way, was Zahir with you?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahir's vanished into thin air! I'll ask him when he's back.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going with your sister's marriage?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're meeting after ages...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't we just talk about us?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring the table here.
-Yes, ma'am.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's have lunch here.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please get us our lunch here, Ghulam Hussain.
-As you wish, ma'am.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd pick that. Your favourite.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know me so well.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and so does Ghulam Hussain!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'With BEST WISHES'

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'CONGRATULATIONS SIR.
~FROM SANA.'

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is this, Sana?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A small gift, sir. On your promotion.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As a colleague, sir...?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Sana... You're giving me gifts now... Coming to my place... Getting close to Mum... 'As a colleague'? Seriously? Just -- Why?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, sir.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww... C'mon... No need to cry.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please get her some water, Asif.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last time you were here, I wanted to stop you.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've stopped me.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how? You were so intoxicated with love!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My biggest mistake!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? He deserted you?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I deserted him!

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh... That's really sad.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wicked!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't deserve my love.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always thought he's lucky.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask something?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you love anyone else?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- Would you allow anyone else...?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If, somehow, we had an understanding... That... Perhaps, somewhere down the line... Gave way to love?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?
-I know it sounds awkward, but...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think I could've said it any other time...

67
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:30,028
Not funny!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not kidding. I'm serious - I really like you.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- Look at you and look at me, Mr Atif...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take my hand. Bridge the gap.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing I can't get you. You can live out all your dreams.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's get back to the shoot.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The shoot, yeah...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think we're gonna need it.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

77
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:16,493
It seems so selfish...

78
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:22,966
You don't care one bit about me... Even after everything I've done for you...

79
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:26,176
It's all about give and take, you know...

80
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:32,899
If you ask me, there's a simple formula to fulfil every dream...

81
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:38,329
Feel free to come back when you've understood it.

82
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,200
Think about it, will ya?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika!

84
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,396
Get in, I'll drop you home.

85
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:19,711
No thanks. I can walk.
-Hey!

86
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,023
Why do you want to walk in this scorching heat? Get in.

87
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:27,024
Feelin' the heat already?

88
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:30,324
Oh yeah... With that AC in your car, I mean, like...

89
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:36,486
Thanks to you! I got this car because you always said that clunker didn't suit you.

90
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:39,618
Well, in case you didn't realise, even this won't suit me.

91
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,716
Just give me some time.

92
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:46,216
If you're by my side, Malika, I'm sure this is only the beginning.

93
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:48,936
In your dreams!

94
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:50,997
Beat it, amigo!

95
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,949
Not a smile, not a greeting! Making progress, I see!

96
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:14,818
I didn't see you.

97
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:18,962
Aye, right, how'd you even know who's around in this château?

98
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:23,988
Blimey, Mum, you're at it before I've even stepped in!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and freshen up. I'll get you lunch.
-I'm not hungry.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?
-Jeez, Mum, I just don't want to have lunch.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had a row?

102
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:44,830
Who'd I have a row with? Just ran into that blimmin' Asim on the way. He said he'd drop me home.

103
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,061
What'd you say?
-Why'd I get in with him?

104
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:54,061
You should've told him he's got no right to drop you home when he's dropped out of your life.

105
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:59,735
Seriously, what is he? He's so pig-headed!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wouldn't have asked you to get in if he had any shame.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, freshen up. I'll get you some lunch.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're late.
-Yeah. Just a tad busy today...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get ready quick.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember it's Mrs Qadir's anniversary today?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're going over.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I totally forgot!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No problem. Get ready. I'll call and tell her we'll be late.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, I'm really tired. How say you go alone?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alone?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You used to go alone before your marriage, right?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't get married to go alone.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Zoha, what's up with you?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even come for Zahir's birthday last week.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, Zoha, we're not teens.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't go out on these honeymoon trips every other day.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got your own life, I've got mine. Just live and let live.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it, Atif.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong if I want to go somewhere with my husband?
-I don't want to. I'm really tired.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Atif --

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Atif. I just wanted to thank you for the lovely dinner. What a lovely evening!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Who was it?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Shazia...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who you've been with all day...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, mate... She's just a good friend!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want me to believe that?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, it was a business meeting! That's all!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My eyes grow lonely</i>

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yearning to see you</i>

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come here, my dear</i>

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yea, just you...</i>

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you turn off the lights if you're still up?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just felt like it...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get yourself out of this darkness, Noriyan.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even care about you, but you don't even want to forget her!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know Malika better than me.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could never really know her...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what've you done now that you do?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've thrown her out of your heart like a piece of trash!
-Mum...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say that...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you really want me to say something good about her?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was never yours! Why can't you understand?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have the courage...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You had the courage to love someone who never wanted to be yours.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So be it...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just meet her once, then.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gather some courage.

158
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:47,156
You may grow to hate her so much you may even laugh to remember your love.

159
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:54,881
The way you laugh at my love?

160
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:03,292
Not your love.

161
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:17,294
I laugh at how mistaken you were that she deserved you.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for taking the time to come here.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't take your calls...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was very busy.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you a little too busy these days? Like, c'mon, mate, we're family.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We are? Looking at you, it doesn't seem like that!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Zahir, seriously. What's wrong? Why are you so distant?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you care.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think I'm your enemy.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard that Aqil complain to you about me!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't even told him anything I say to your face. You're just angry for no reason.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes, I'm wrong.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I stood by you when your husband left you.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I supported you because I didn't want anyone to take advantage of you. Because you're so nice.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're not just cousins, Zahir, we're best friends. I know you worry for me.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I know what's good for me.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil makes me really happy.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My wish is his command.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you used to say about Atif, remember?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But look what happened. He left you alone.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back then, I felt pity for you.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it hurts me when I see you with Aqil now.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you're making the same mistake all over again.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you've stood by me because you pitied me, you better leave.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need your sympathies.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always get me wrong.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just can't understand, Zoha.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Aqil's just making you emotionally vulnerable!
-So what? I'm already emotionally invested in him! Why don't you understand that?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a jolly good time with Aqil. But don't come crying when he's deserted you.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sana's on leave again?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she's never taken a day off before.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what happened.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?
-What you said to her...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had a go at her, so to speak...

198
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,222
She says she's leaving the job.

199
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:38,592
Leaving the job?

200
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,823
Because of that? Seriously?

201
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:53,284
No one's ever told her off. You're the last person she thought who'd... She's just a bit hurt, that's all...

202
00:18:53,284 --> 00:19:04,604
Well, Miss Farah, please tell her this silliness is most unprofessional. I wanted to clear things up, that's all. Please, call her right away.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim's asking about you.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He told me to tell you

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That what you're doing is plain silly and unprofessional.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's right.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better be here tomorrow then.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've applied somewhere...
-Are you nuts? You won't get a job just like that!

211
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:47,156
I can't face him now...

212
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:54,743
Why? It was just a gift on his promotion. Big deal!
-Does he get why I gave him the gift?

213
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:59,924
Good that he figured it out. Because I don't think you would've told him, like, ever!

214
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:01,564
What good is it anyway?

215
00:20:01,564 --> 00:20:07,844
I can't even say he's got a place in his heart for me to indulge myself...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Sana come to work today?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Why?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me. Everything alright with her?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd I know?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow... Anyway, I'll give you her number. Call and ask her.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I call her? She must have her reasons...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called her twice, but she didn't take my call.

223
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:38,508
Why did you call her?
-Just felt like I should.

224
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:46,748
Please try to get it, Mum... She's just my colleague. Don't get so close to her that she starts thinking anything else.

225
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:51,388
She's unlike most of the girls these days.

226
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:54,898
Loving, caring, kind...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you understand, Noriyan? I don't want anything to do with you.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just listen to me once, Malika...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to hear anything.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- Just meet me once, Malika -- I won't see you ever again.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your senses? Who do you think you are? Why should I meet you?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No -- Malika... I want you to see that everything's the same as it used to be. I still love you... I can't imagine my life without you!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... Just give me one chance... One chance to explain myself.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'm gonna have to block your number, because you ain't gonna get it any other way.

235
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:45,295
If you did that, I'll come over and talk about everything before everyone!

236
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:49,746
My brother's gonna break your bones!

237
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:54,026
You've broken my heart... I don't care about a few broken bones...

238
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:56,056
You're getting yourself in big trouble!

239
00:21:56,056 --> 00:22:02,496
I knew I was in big trouble the moment I realised that one lie drew a wedge between us!

240
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:09,997
If you know you were lying, why do you expect Malika to love you now?

241
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:15,416
I'll be waiting for you at the university at 9 in the morning. Bye.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know if you need anything, Granny.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I need at this age?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And who'd I ask but you if I needed anything?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be glad to be of help.

246
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:49,136
Okay...

247
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:52,506
Is Sana coming to work tomorrow?

248
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:53,787
No idea.

249
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,727
What do you mean?

250
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:59,747
Blimey, you've started asking questions like Mum.

251
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:06,876
I really like her. She's so nice. Didn't you ask her why she didn't come?

252
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:10,017
I'll ask her when she's back.

253
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:14,868
She isn't coming to work. You ought to call and ask her.

254
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:18,969
I was busy. Didn't get the time to ask her.

255
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:22,221
Okay, call her. I'll talk.
-Blimey, Granny...

256
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:27,389
Just call her. What if she needed help?

257
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:36,141
I'm sure she doesn't. She's fine. Just -- Making an issue of something trivial...

258
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:40,419
Something you've said, I'm sure?

259
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,931
Let her be upset if that's what she wants.

260
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:45,912
C'mon, call her. I want to talk to her.

261
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:50,222
Blimey... I shouldn't be calling her at this hour!

262
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:54,872
I want to talk to her.

263
00:23:54,872 --> 00:23:57,222
Just... Blimey...

264
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,332
Good evening, Sana.

265
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:05,692
How are you?

266
00:24:05,692 --> 00:24:11,413
Yeah, Mum and Granny were worried about you.

267
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,833
Yes.

268
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:20,944
If it was something I said, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

269
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:24,665
I just told you what I thought.

270
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,634
Granny wants to talk to you.

271
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:36,527
Hello. How are you, Sana? Alright there?

272
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:40,537
I just pulled Asim up about it.

273
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:47,568
Feel free to talk to me or Salma if there's any problem.

274
00:24:47,897 --> 00:24:51,778
Okay, take care.

275
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:53,847
Bye.

276
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,039
I don't want to hear anything of the sort again, okay?

277
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,009
What are you looking at?

278
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:06,489
My, you've started caring for Sana a lot! Just like Mum!

279
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:10,990
You should care about her too. She's proper nice.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how you should talk to girls.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously? Me?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Novera. You didn't have to start with your banter in front of her.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I say to her?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not really into this dating thing. Why'd you say you thought I was on a date?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, mate, I was just kidding... What happened to your sense of humour?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when did I talk to you about her?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not fair.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're overreacting.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, have you never talked to Novera about me?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I haven't.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're one tough nut.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've changed since she got here.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy there. I'm at the office until the evening.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And where are you after that?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I request you...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please control yourself before her, okay?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So possessive! My, my...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Not your fault.

301
00:26:36,479 --> 00:26:42,529
She always looks... Different... At first sight. The most unique.

302
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:47,204
In time, you realise they're all the same.

303
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:52,776
Why am I even talking to you? I think I'm wasting my time.

304
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:58,416
Oh, really! You're wasting your time with me!

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, I guess I should get going. The last thing I'd want is to waste your time.
-Be done with it already, mate.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you like to have?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so worried about you!

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd happen to you after your marriage!

309
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:25,258
Don't worry, Monsieur. Please worry about yourself and Mme. Zoha, who, by the way, is gonna pummel you proper, I tell you.

310
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:27,198
Were it so easy!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I really gotta go now.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where to?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Mme. Zoha's back.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, she is?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back on duty, eh?

316
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:53,685
Trust me, she's a real psycho.

317
00:27:53,685 --> 00:27:58,515
You're in for a proper thwacking now!

318
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:01,086
On that note, cheers!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some.
-Not now. I'll get going.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going somewhere, Waqas?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum.

324
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:26,419
I thought you were getting him married pronto, Aunt.

325
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:30,229
But he says you've only fixed an engagement...

326
00:28:30,624 --> 00:28:32,983
We're doing what's best for us.

327
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:38,749
Novera's a real gem. Seriously.

328
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:42,344
Miss her and you ain't gonna get second chances!

329
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,589
Anyway, take care. I'll get going.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Aunt, bye!

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here. Sit.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Mum?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He met Novera?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes, yesterday...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you introduce him to her?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't introduce him. He just bumped into us.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't like him one bit, Waqas.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm tolerating him only because he's your friend.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please work on your priorities, and keep him out the door.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't like him because he's middle class, right?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've been okay with him if he knew his place.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wasn't that your jacket he was wearing?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He liked it, so I gave it to him.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... He better stop coming here every other day. And don't discuss Novera with him.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Mum.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not making you tea.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you'd just have your cup and leave.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm with you all day. What else do you want?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why, but I get worried you may not come back...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jee --

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love me so much. It's only natural.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't help it...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think that was my problem with Atif...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave him so much, and whoever loves more gets exploited.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess that's why I'm so insecure...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry if you feel suffocated...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough! You better not say his name again.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry. I was just explaining myself.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I have no interest in your past, and I don't like it when you discuss your ex.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was my past. You're my present.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I come here to forget all my worries.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather leave than hear any of that.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do that.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what I'd do without you.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Just relax.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just a bit tensed these days...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I had a go at you.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now... Why are you so tensed? Tell me.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my sister...

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her engagement's almost broken...

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't arrange for her wedding!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can help.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All that's mine is yours, too. You know that.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can arrange for your sister's wedding.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to test me?
-I'm not.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to get you out of this worry.
-No.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anything from you.
-Cheque or cash?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's 200,000. I'll arrange for more by tomorrow.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I --
-It's not for you. It's for your sister. It's her wedding.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil... Please...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it...

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim... I wanted to talk about something...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

395
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:39,415
Please forget everything Sana said.

396
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:41,052
I don't get it.

397
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:51,883
I just mean -- You think she's not the right type -- Always looking for excuses to get your attention...

398
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:54,633
Miss Farah...

399
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:59,553
Please don't talk to me about it again. I don't like it.

400
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:04,091
Why do you always think about yourself?

401
00:34:04,091 --> 00:34:05,091
What do you mean?

402
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:10,401
Her family's going through hard times. That's why she works here.

403
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:11,532
So?

404
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:15,896
She's going to leave the job. Please, try to understand!

405
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,066
What?

406
00:34:17,066 --> 00:34:19,526
Yes, sir!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange...

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's it such a big deal?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zo -- Zoha... It's Aqil...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Why are you so worried?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- Just a few steps from your place -- I -- Some robbers -- Took my bike, the cash at gunpoint -- Everything!

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you alright?

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ye -- Yeah... I'm fine, but -- They took everything!

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me where you are. I'm coming to get you.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send you my location.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Just wait for me.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me here?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. I don't see you around these days. What's up, mate?

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me you're still grieving over her!

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just felt a bit down...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure I'll be fine after talking to you, Atif.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How will you move on if you keep thinking about her?

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know about the girls these days... In and out of your life when they want. I'm sure you'll find many others. Don't worry.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yeah, get some air.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also... Movie night with me tonight?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you, then.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God you're safe.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to fight back, Zoha, but --
-Are you crazy? You should've given them what they wanted quietly.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea what could've happened.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's already happened.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost everything.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm happy you're safe... What if something happened to you?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything could've happened.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess what, no one came to help me!

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody risks his life for anyone.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Zoha...

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bike you gave -- The cash -- I lost all of it...

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get it all back, Aqil.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
