1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,020
What were you thinking?

2
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,110
Were you just going to fight him like a chav?

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:33,467
As if you've got a shortage of cars!

4
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:36,700
If I don't, it doesn't mean I can go about ramming random cars on the road!

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,990
Can't you look where you're going?

6
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,860
It's not that...

7
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,990
It's not my car... That's why...

8
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,910
What?

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,640
What do you mean?

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,380
I mean -- It's Mum's car... She'd be furious...

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,950
Whatever.

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,580
Drop me at the bus stop. I'll walk home.

13
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,542
Alright, sorry. Why are you getting so angry?

14
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:05,256
We'd just started on our long drive!

15
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:08,709
Spend a little time with me?

16
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,152
Alright.

17
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:12,914
But promise me.

18
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:17,530
Promise that you won't create a scene on the road like that.

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,248
Look at your status, your background... It just doesn't suit you!

20
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:29,412
Alright. Sorry. I promise I won't do anything of the sort. Please fix your mood.

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,310
These are some of the faces that would suit our requirements, sir.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,167
They're good, but I don't quite see the innocence we need in any of them.

23
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,529
I'll show you some other portfolios.

24
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,680
We're short on time...

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,280
I understand, sir... I'll do something.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,106
Please. Double time.

27
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,086
Hello?

28
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,350
Atif...

29
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,068
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

30
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:15,461
No. What happened?

31
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:17,336
Atif...

32
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:20,396
I made a small mistake...

33
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,380
Why are you so confused? Go on.

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,720
I --

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,310
I had an accident... It isn't serious, the car's -- But I swear it wasn't my fault.
-No worries.

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,550
You're safe, aren't you? That's what I care about.

37
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:43,590
Surely, you aren't angry, Atif?

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,348
No way.

39
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,257
We'll talk in the evening.

40
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:49,926
Thank you, Atif.

41
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:51,459
It's okay, mate.

42
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:53,071
Relax.

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,686
How will I tell Mum...

44
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,864
Yeah, it's one of my favourite movies.

45
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,641
I bet it'll win an Oscar.

46
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,181
I haven't watched one in so long...

47
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,740
Half-and-half popcorn.

48
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,230
What?

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,788
Seriously?

50
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:22,730
No...

51
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,680
That's too sweet.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,935
Half-and-half's best. Trust me.

53
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:31,060
Yes -- H -- Hey! What are you doing?

54
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,389
Give it to me.

55
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,930
I won't.

56
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,437
I've been calling you for an hour!

57
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:39,159
But you're busy, as usual!

58
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,877
Do you remember we're having lunch with Mr Ahmed from Lahore?

59
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,130
I totally forgot...

60
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,770
You know I'm careless with my phone...

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,630
You're only careless for me.

62
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,960
You answer Aqil's calls in less than a moment. You don't keep him waiting!

63
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,798
Help me up.

64
00:03:57,798 --> 00:04:01,260
Seriously, Zahir...
-You don't keep him waiting one moment!

65
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,013
You're so predictable.

66
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:11,460
I knew you'd find some excuse to bring Aqil up.

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,780
I don't need to bring him up. He's already here.

68
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,560
In the family, the partnership... And between whatever's left of our friendship.

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,770
Okay, my dear cousin and business partner. Enough for a day.

70
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,317
Tea or coffee?

71
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,600
Neither.

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
I'd have brunch today.

73
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,873
Asian style.

74
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:38,570
Egg, paratha, tea, and chicken karai.

75
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,141
I'll have only one paratha because we're going out for dinner.

76
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:47,330
I think it's time you got married.

77
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,514
You sound like the typical Asian glutton!

78
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:54,570
Order your lady around like that.

79
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,550
No way. My lady couldn't stay for a year!

80
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,704
Women can be so demanding... I'd rather keep my distance.

81
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,380
Big words...

82
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,310
What does it matter?

83
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:12,730
I can guarantee that Aunt will get you married the moment she comes from London.

84
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,452
By the way, Aunt Pakiza's daughter, Alizé - She's gorgeous!

85
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,750
A complete psycho if you ask me.

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,521
What?

87
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,496
Know what, she talks to her dogs.

88
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:25,990
And her dogs talk back.

89
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,316
Are you serious?

90
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:32,385
She even told her dog everything about our lunch date.

91
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,630
I've really decided to keep my distance.

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,540
You'd better stay away from her type too! Stay happy, stay single.

93
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,590
In other words, Alizé didn't reject you.

94
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,541
Her dog did!

95
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,682
Ghulam Hussain!

96
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,570
This is what I always warned you about! It's a long way down...

97
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,779
How will we pay for it?

98
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,380
But Mum...

99
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,310
You should be happy I didn't get hurt.

100
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,750
But you're right...

101
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,080
I'll be more careful now.

102
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,762
What?

103
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:16,498
You'll keep your hands off anything that's Mr Atif's!

104
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:20,920
And if you did, I'd leave this place and my job that instant!

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,730
I mean it!

106
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,090
I'll talk to Mr Atif.

107
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,347
Mum...

108
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:28,550
I've talked to Atif. He's got no problem.

109
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,510
He's very kind...

110
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,377
But you should know your place.

111
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,160
He's our master.

112
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,610
Why can't you see it?

113
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,911
Because I can see that he doesn't think of himself as a master.
-Enough, Noriyan!

114
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:51,070
Just because you get to eat with a silver spoon, don't think it's yours!

115
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,970
You better know your place or you'll pay for it.

116
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,700
What happened? Why are you so angry?

117
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,636
I was just trying to get some sense into him. I'll get your tea.
-It's no big deal.

118
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:09,720
I've told him. He'll be careful. Right?

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,300
There. Take it easy. Go.

120
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,873
Thank you Atif.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,918
Come.

122
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,260
What's up?

123
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,890
What is this?

124
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,570
Don't you know how to come to your sister's room?

125
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,135
I've got my eyes on you.

126
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,073
You better watch out...

127
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:13,310
Or there will be trouble.

128
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,720
What've I done now?

129
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,600
It doesn't suit any half-decent girl!

130
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,851
I've told you so many times! But you!

131
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,320
Look...

132
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,454
What you're always up to is pure lewdness.

133
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,250
Get it?

134
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,650
What do you think about yourself?

135
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,204
What's going on?

136
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,500
What is it with the two of you?

137
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,630
Jeez, Malika...

138
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,630
What've you done? These were a part of the order... I've told you so many times...

139
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,499
You've always got your eyes on others' things... Take these off before you spoil them!

140
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,610
Take them off!

141
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,730
And what's up with him? What'd he say?

142
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,710
Just what I absolutely hate!

143
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,420
Alright, take these off.

144
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,870
Before you spoil them.

145
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,862
She just doesn't understand...

146
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,798
I've just put them on...

147
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,948
There goes the mood...

148
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,057
Asim!

149
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,060
Come here, dinner's ready.

150
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,915
Coming.

151
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,877
I'm starving.

152
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:32,251
Come.

153
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:33,780
What've you got?

154
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,720
Pilaf, vegetables...

155
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,810
How are you?

156
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,536
Better now.

157
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:49,740
What happened?
-My blood pressure was high in the morning. I took a pill. I'm fine now.

158
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,846
Don't have this, then, Mum.

159
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,298
It's no big deal. I'm just having a little.

160
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,284
You don't look after yourself.

161
00:11:56,284 --> 00:12:00,377
Well, in that case, get me the one who'll look after me.

162
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:03,285
Let her be done with her exams.

163
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:06,810
Are you sure she'd come once she's done with her exams?

164
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,970
Aunt's given her word. I don't know why you're so worried.

165
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,194
She thinks of me as her son.

166
00:12:13,194 --> 00:12:17,506
Zahida thinks of you as her son because her son's a layabout.

167
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:21,600
As for her word, Zahida's given hers...

168
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,130
Looking at Malika... She doesn't seem the right type...

169
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,905
It's nothing like that. Just empty fears.

170
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:32,788
That's why you're always sick.

171
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,865
It isn't an empty fear, Asim.

172
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:38,180
I haven't seen an ounce of love in Malika's eyes.

173
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,239
Girls never get tired of rejoicing when they're betrothed.

174
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:46,702
And Malika... She doesn't even greet back.

175
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,067
No, Mum, it isn't like that.

176
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,430
Anyway. Your food's getting cold.

177
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,960
I know you don't want to hear a word against her. That's why I'm tolerating her.

178
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,831
Malika...

179
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,370
Get us another chapati.

180
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,389
Coming.

181
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,831
Here.

182
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,940
Bon appétit.

183
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,360
Asim called in the afternoon.

184
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,730
Yes. I talked to him.

185
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:35,866
He mentioned one of his colleagues. Said he's from a good family. He wanted to talk about Munni.

186
00:13:36,335 --> 00:13:38,648
Talk what about who?

187
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:42,838
He's found a match for Munni. He cares for us so much.

188
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,849
Like a son.

189
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,735
Hey!

190
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,800
Finish you dinner first!

191
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,983
I'm coming.
-Aqil!

192
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:08,500
Naturally. When the son's useless, his type have to fill in.

193
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,667
What do you mean 'his type'? He's family.

194
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,446
I don't consider him family just yet.

195
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,838
Please tell him to stop looking.

196
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:19,460
He can only find plebs like himself!

197
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,810
Blimming friendly-neighbourhood go-between.

198
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:27,338
May the Lord hammer some sense into you and your brother. You two will kill me!

199
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,136
No idea why the internet slowed down when you came here.

200
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:47,804
I think it's a problem with your laptop.

201
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:52,190
Why don't you order a new one for me and take mine?

202
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,690
Your laptop's quite expensive, Atif... Please, give it to someone else.

203
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,590
Who've I got except you?

204
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,490
You're my brother. I'd love it if you use it.

205
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,097
Splendid...

206
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:07,831
So that means you'll also leave me a share in your will.

207
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:10,340
Blimey, I'm rich!

208
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,427
Aye...

209
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,290
Atif...

210
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,922
I hope you didn't mind.

211
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,800
Why would I?

212
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:34,145
Seriously... If anything happened to me...
-What are you saying, Atif? God forbid! I was just kidding!

213
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,613
You got so serious...

214
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,820
The download's complete!

215
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,597
Well, then, What are we waiting for? It's show time!

216
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,192
Zoha!

217
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,393
I'm here.

218
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,030
Zoha!

219
00:16:01,596 --> 00:16:02,845
Zoha?

220
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,660
The guests are waiting for you!

221
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,736
What do I tell them?

222
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:07,990
I'm waiting for Aqil.

223
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,250
He's not here, he's not even taking my call!

224
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,187
Please, Zoha, not today!

225
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:15,110
Can't you stay away from him for a day?

226
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,420
They're all here for the gossip.

227
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,503
I don't care.

228
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:21,975
I'm upset because he's not taking my call!

229
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,790
Oh -- Yes...

230
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,177
Thank God...

231
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:28,366
Where are you?

232
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:31,710
The guests are here. I'm waiting for you.

233
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,470
I'm waiting for my cab. It's late...

234
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,360
Oh... You've ordered a cab...

235
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,721
Alright...

236
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,570
Get here quick.

237
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,147
I'm coming. Okay.
-Okay. I'm waiting. Bye.

238
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:46,935
He's coming.

239
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,380
Okay...
-Yeah?

240
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,141
Keep an eye on him.

241
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,668
He better not start getting too cosy with the ladies.

242
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:55,160
Try to keep him away from the guests.

243
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,565
I've called him here so I can introduce him to all my friends.

244
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,110
Zoha...

245
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,510
You're giving them the gossip yourself...

246
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,479
I really can't help you...

247
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,920
They're gonna gossip anyway.

248
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,370
They just need an excuse.

249
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,610
Aqil's coming! I'm so glad!

250
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,209
Alright...

251
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:15,960
Oh...

252
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,120
Over here.

253
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,940
The salad is different today.
-Hello, Mum.

254
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,860
Hello.
-Hey, Atif.
-Hey!

255
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,762
You're back early.

256
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:41,167
Yeah, I didn't have much to do today.

257
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,882
Did you check your WhatsApp?

258
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,630
How was my performance?

259
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,466
Your performance? Well -- It was... Brilliant. Very good.

260
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,145
You're quite the actor, mate!

261
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:53,534
Oh...!

262
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,550
And... How was my dance?

263
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:04,180
Your dance... Was also -- great. I loved your moves... Never knew --
-Yes! You are so busted!

264
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,327
I didn't dance at all, Atif.

265
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,208
Blimey...

266
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,868
Mind your tongue, Noriyan...

267
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:12,670
Why are you scolding him?

268
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,820
Seriously, mate. I didn't get the time. But I'll check it out today.

269
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,080
You won't leave me until I have.

270
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,580
Sure. You know you can't lie to me, Atif!

271
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,786
Aye, I can't lie to anyone...

272
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,859
And he is sooo busted...

273
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,662
Noriyan...

274
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,615
Yes, Mum?

275
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,250
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, talking to Mr Atif like that?

276
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,545
It was just a bit of banter!

277
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:01,108
You'd do well to know the difference between his place and yours.

278
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,870
I don't like it one bit. You called him a liar?

279
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,270
Because he was lying!

280
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,601
Whatever!

281
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,330
We're his servants.

282
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,503
Who are we to 'bust' him?

283
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:16,253
We're servants, Mum... Not slaves.

284
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:21,150
There's a difference, sweet Maman.

285
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,550
Whatever.

286
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,132
I better not catch you talking to him like that again!

287
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,870
That's the bleedin' limit...

288
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,627
Done scolding him?

289
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:46,270
He had it coming...

290
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,700
He forgets his place.

291
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,355
Please don't scold him.

292
00:19:53,746 --> 00:19:58,527
He's my son. He'd better remember his place.

293
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:03,619
It's better that I remind him, before anyone else does.

294
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,948
And so you leave me speechless so often...

295
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,324
Ayesha!

296
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,649
Sweet Jesus!

297
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:34,026
God bless you. May you go on a pilgrimage soon!

298
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,980
May your beloved over you swoon!

299
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,940
Your English rose, the envy of the moon!

300
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,327
I'm blessing you so much. Won't you give me something?

301
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,260
Look at him blush at the mention of his English rose!

302
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,370
Take these blessings and flowers, and delight Shamim Ara!

303
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,310
Flowers are an ode to love.

304
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,250
I'm sure she'll be all yours!

305
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,422
Really? I never knew these flowers could be so powerful.

306
00:21:01,422 --> 00:21:06,240
Aye, prince charming! I'm sure she'll be enchanted!

307
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,085
Give me something, will you?

308
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,938
Be done with it already!

309
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,790
Shamim Ara's as happy as Larry!

310
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:17,090
♪ <i>This love is like fire and ice...</i> ♪

311
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,052
♪ <i>This love is like rain and blue skies...</i> ♪

312
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,929
Malika...

313
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,430
Malika!

314
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,937
Let's go over to Aunt Salma's.

315
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,749
Why? What's there?

316
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:38,702
You shouldn't be saying that!

317
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:40,395
You've got your world there.

318
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:44,470
I don't want the 'world' you're talking about.

319
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,110
Why do you say that?

320
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,410
Asim loves you so much.

321
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,350
To the dickens with his love.

322
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,071
Can a man who juggles two jobs be one bit romantic?

323
00:21:56,071 --> 00:22:00,127
You ain't gonna change...

324
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:05,200
Anyway, let's get going. Asim told me Aunt's not well.

325
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,751
How much younger than Asim are you?

326
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:08,455
Why?

327
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:12,430
Looking at your care for her, you ought to be her daughter-in-law!

328
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,896
Have some shame, Malika.

329
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,140
He's your husband to-be!

330
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,910
Have some respect.

331
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,320
I've been telling her Aunt's not well for so long... But she just won't budge!

332
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,805
Yes. Your Aunt's really unwell.

333
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,580
Come with me, Munni.

334
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,030
Leave her to herself.

335
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,770
I know it very well.

336
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,111
You want to get me married to that Asim!

337
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,332
That's why you want to take me there.

338
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:39,272
Nothing can fix you.

339
00:22:39,272 --> 00:22:41,090
Seriously...

340
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:46,033
Why the devil do you keep lecturing then?
-Get my wallet, Munni.

341
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,300
You don't take care of yourself, Salma. You don't take your pills on time.

342
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,910
That's why your BP's never normal.

343
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,920
Aunt's right.

344
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,470
She doesn't take care of herself. She stops taking her pills when she gets better.

345
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,408
This is very bad. Don't be so cruel to yourself.

346
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:28,180
The pills are so expensive... This poor lad's already juggling a job and tuitions...

347
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,331
I just do it to save something...

348
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:32,831
Aunt...

349
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,066
Did you hear that?

350
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:36,441
May the Lord provide for him.

351
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:40,100
Who else would care for you?

352
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,413
Alright, I'll go and iron my shirt for the morning.

353
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:47,746
I'll do it, Asim. You can talk.
-No, Munni.

354
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:53,080
You work at home, too. I'll do it.
-It's no big deal.

355
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,710
Give me any other shirts you have as well. I'll iron them all.

356
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,337
Give her, Asim. She's your sister.

357
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,960
Who else would care for you?

358
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,525
She'll do it.

359
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,910
Alright, come here. The iron's on the stand.

360
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,616
I'll go freshen up.

361
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:09,251
Here.

362
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,390
You could've brought Malika here.

363
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,793
She was tired when she got back from the university.

364
00:24:16,793 --> 00:24:20,693
I thought she'd better rest.

365
00:24:20,866 --> 00:24:25,508
Ah, the love of the child... It makes you lie to your sister...

366
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:30,553
I know she doesn't want to meer her Aunt. That's why it was just you yesterday.

367
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,220
It's not like that, Salma.

368
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,873
She's so close to you now.

369
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:42,510
I don't think she feels anything for any relations, Zahida.

370
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,640
Mum...

371
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,290
You know the university's so far away.

372
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,154
It's a long way home!

373
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,436
Malika always asks about you when I go there.

374
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:56,470
So you were listening in on us!

375
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,071
No one backs Malika like him!

376
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,420
I dare not complain about Malika.

377
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,567
You're not wrong here...

378
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:09,784
Malika's coldness worries me, too.

379
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,918
I guess Her Majesty's just living up to her name!

380
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:17,800
You're just getting worried for nothing.

381
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,720
What do I do with him! Madly in love with Malika.

382
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,117
May the Lord keep them happy.
-Amen.

383
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,380
Girls today are smart when it comes to love.

384
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,968
The love is as deep as the boy's pockets!

385
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:05,828
Malika's not like that, my dear.

386
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:07,940
That's where you're wrong, my friend.

387
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,136
She hasn't the foggiest.

388
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,547
What're you dreaming of?

389
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,555
Who else, but you?

390
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:38,950
Really?

391
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,107
What's this spell you've cast on me that makes me think of you even when you're not with me?

392
00:28:45,548 --> 00:28:47,590
Seriously?

393
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,541
You're happy to hear it?

394
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,277
Obviously.

395
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:54,794
And I'm nervous...

396
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:56,073
Nervous?

397
00:28:56,073 --> 00:28:57,619
Why?

398
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,940
Malika...

399
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,260
I want to ask you something.

400
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,120
Go on.

401
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,265
Grab a pew.

402
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,002
How much do you love me?

403
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:15,574
Do you need to ask?

404
00:29:15,574 --> 00:29:18,855
I'm serious, Malika. Tell me.

405
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:26,040
If I asked you how much you love me?

406
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,947
I love you so much that I can give up everything for you.

407
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,038
I've been doing a lot for you as well, Noriyan.

408
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,102
If you know what I'm saying.

409
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,000
Alright, tell me. What kind of life do you want with me?

410
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,949
What do you mean, 'what kind of life'?

411
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:55,470
I'm serious, Malika. Please, tell me.

412
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:02,010
Obviously, a life of comfort, luxuries, serenity... Love...

413
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,210
And if you got a life...

414
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,452
With just love?

415
00:30:07,995 --> 00:30:11,920
No comforts... No luxuries...?

416
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,310
What's up with you?

417
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,882
Why are you scaring me with this nightmare?

418
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,500
Anyway. I'm here to study. I don't want to think about any bad thing.

419
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,465
Keep at it if you want.

420
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,885
Thank you.

421
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,398
Where are you?

422
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:51,505
I'm right here.

423
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,582
I'm sure you haven't even started reading this.

424
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:55,830
We're submitting this presentation tomorrow!

425
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,470
There's so much work!

426
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,156
It's so boring...

427
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:02,266
Why don't you go? I don't want to.

428
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:06,860
I know what you want. And let me tell you, you won't get anything.

429
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,640
It's all your loss.

430
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:15,201
Why are you talking about losses and gains?

431
00:31:15,201 --> 00:31:18,024
It's not a business transaction.

432
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:20,420
I'm in a relationship with Aqil!

433
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,510
What kind of a relationship is this?

434
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,337
You're the only one in it.

435
00:31:24,337 --> 00:31:25,792
He's nowhere!

436
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,430
Is he ever there for you when you need him?

437
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,390
Even though you've done so much for him!

438
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,840
You're just not getting it!

439
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,553
How do I tell you that Aqil is --

440
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,470
Profit and loss, eh?

441
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,725
'Never calls me'?

442
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,080
Excuse me.

443
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,528
Blimey...

444
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,486
Hi!

445
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,706
Aunt!

446
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,321
Aunt!

447
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,208
Mum and Munni aren't home.

448
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:03,159
Aqil's gone somewhere too.

449
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,812
Hey...

450
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:07,472
I got these for you.

451
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,490
But why? You know I'm allergic to flowers!

452
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,690
You never told me about what you like...

453
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,824
How'd I know you're allergic to them?

454
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,800
If you're here to talk about all of that, you better leave.

455
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,222
Come back when someone's here.

456
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,518
Can't you talk softly to me, Malika?

457
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:35,510
Just humour me and say that you like the garlands?

458
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:41,593
I got engaged to you to humour you and the family! What else do you want?

459
00:32:42,457 --> 00:32:45,530
So you got engaged just to humour me?

460
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,474
Of course!

461
00:32:48,392 --> 00:32:49,329
Malika...

462
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,990
What do I lack?

463
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,558
I respect you, love you...

464
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:55,907
I'll keep you happy all your life.

465
00:32:55,907 --> 00:33:00,060
Asim, I can't stand this blather.

466
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,502
You better show up only when you can get gold bangles instead of these garlands.

467
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:10,580
And don't go back to Mummy crying about what Malika said!

468
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,290
The door's that way.

469
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,530
If anyone saw you around, it's me they'd be after!

470
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,077
Go!

471
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,343
Bugger off already!

472
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,650
Yes, Atif?

473
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,112
Yes, Noriyan...

474
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:14,070
Who's this girl onstage with you?

475
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,119
She's a class fellow... What happened?

476
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:21,528
She's the perfect face for my new project.

477
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,240
But I know her, Atif...

478
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,990
She won't be interested.

479
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,060
How do you know that?

480
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,680
By the way, she's just your class fellow, right? Or...

481
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,228
Yes, Atif. She's just my class fellow.

482
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:43,260
How can you be so sure she won't be interested?

483
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,216
She may get interested if she heard my offer!

484
00:34:47,216 --> 00:34:50,809
She's from a very conservative family, Atif.

485
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,528
She can't even think about it.

486
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:56,948
Forget about that. Just give me her number.

487
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,070
Hello?

488
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,721
What happened? What are you thinking?

489
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:10,628
I haven't even got her number, Atif...

490
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:11,510
What?

491
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,481
You've got this lovely lady in your class, and you haven't even got her number?

492
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,807
What'll you do, Noriyan...

493
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:23,584
Anyway, get it and send it to me.

494
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,461
Alright, Atif, I'll find out.

495
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:30,949
It's urgent. I'll be waiting.

496
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:33,570
Bye.
-Bye.

497
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
