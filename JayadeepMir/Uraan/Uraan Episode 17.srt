1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is for my girl.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're too kind, Salma...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahida... I'm her aunt, after all!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else would get her a gown for her mehndi?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're both just lovely, Aunt!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika, by the way?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was here just now! I think she went out.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you give it to her?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She -- Had a -- headache, Mum...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She took a pill and went to sleep.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd she fall asleep in this noise?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, let's give it to her.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, hello there...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at this lovely mayoun gown! From your aunt!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord give her good fortune. I thought I'd give her these and bless her.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni told me you had a headache. You could've told me. I would've made you some tea.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea ain't gonna cure this headache.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a pill.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do with your blessings for a start...

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say you should get some rest. I'll get going, Zahida...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, Aunt.
-Bye, my dear.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A little more?
-No, thanks.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told us. Noriyan would've brought you here himself.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. What if you got sick on the way?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have come alone.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Sakina, but I thought I'd come here, get myself checked up. I've heard a lot about this doctor.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Uncle... Ain't never a good idea to ignore your health.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell your Mum. She looks so weak...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's got blood pressure and stuff these days. Anyway...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let you go so quickly! You've got to stay here for a few days!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a few days?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay here as long as you want!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you put Mum's complaints to rest, Uncle? You're staying here at least a week.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're family. I want to stay here, too. But you know about your Aunt and the kids...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all alone. Things ain't really good at the village. Robberies and all.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord protect us all...
-No excuses, Uncle. Please.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you stay with us? Remember how much I asked you?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only Mum weren't here alone!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say it's the same with me...

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, check this out.
-Aye, I almost forgot.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leavin' already?
-Yeah, in a bit of a hurry.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wanted to tell you Malika's getting married tomorrow.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you fix the date so suddenly? All good?
-Yeah, it's her in-laws. Blimey... Just had to do it.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You coming?
-Of course.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with Aunt.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell her, but...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't guarantee she'll come.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's back. Why don't you invite her yourself?
-Hello, Aunt. How are you?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, I was just here to invite you.
-To?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His sister's getting married.
-Oh.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to your family.
-Sorry but I haven't got a card. Everything happened so quickly we couldn't even get the cards ready.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay. Waqas'll be there even if I couldn't.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll get going.
-Okay. Take care.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me a glass of water, Nasrin.
-Mum...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you say I'd be there if you couldn't?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you going?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course I am, but I wanted to go with you.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't like your friend one bit.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So please don't insist.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's his sister's wedding. Please.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Waqas.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!
-Hey!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, how are you?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm good.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going back?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, just droppin' by to invite Waqas. My sister's getting married.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's really exciting! I love weddings!

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do? So... Would you like to come over to my place?

79
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:43,319
I mean, just think about it... I live in L.A.

80
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,819
Really? You live in Los Angeles?

81
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,007
No.

82
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:52,866
L.A. - Liaquat-Abad, Karachi.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you folks've got your own L.A. in Karachi!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I read that one in a Kamila Shamsie book... Kartography. Very thoughtful.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what you're saying.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're talking about the social divisions around Clifton Bridge, right?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't believe in social divisions.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be my pleasure to be there if you invite me.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm your typical middle-class local guy.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care about any of that.
-Sure?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye. Take care.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt!
-Hi, how are you? I'm good. You?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great.
-Sit.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never knew we were invited!

97
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:55,695
You know you sound like a typical Paki right now?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think she's talking about the wedding of Aqil's sister.
-Yeah.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He invited you too?
-Yeah. He met me at the door and invited me.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like that. How convenient! I'll leave you to yourselves.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with her?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum doesn't like how casual he is.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh... I see...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You going?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then. I'm coming with you tonight.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wedding's tomorrow.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the mehndi's today! I'm coming with you! I'm so excited!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust me, it ain't nothin' like the movies. Just a small function with the family. Nothing exciting about it.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I still wanna go! And we're going!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'We'? It's a ladies' function. We're going to the wedding together.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, if you don't wanna go, no issues. I can go alone. Give me the address.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... No problem... I'll give you the location.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd get bored there though.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without me?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll enjoy myself.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be really good.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you not come to my mehndi, Granny?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing serious really... Just my blood pressure... I'd rather stay avoid from the crowds...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll be there for everything else.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, your Mum went to give Malika her gown.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wasn't in a particularly fine mood.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's mistaken. That's all.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you Malika loves me.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, why'd she accept the proposal?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've not seen the kind of happiness you'd normally expect around now on her face.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've started thinking like Mum.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, get some rest.

134
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:55,805
Anyway...

135
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:59,985
Did you invite Sana?

136
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:03,884
I've invited all my colleagues... Including her.

137
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:10,875
She called to congratulate me. I've invited her.

138
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:15,565
I don't think she'd be there...

139
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:25,295
I asked her to pray for Asim if she couldn't come...
-Anyway... How d'you like this?

140
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:33,275
My dear Asim looks gorgeous in whatever he wears. God bless you.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness your reports are all fine.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really wanted you to stay here tonight.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to stay here too, but I've got to go.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you come over with Noriyan for a few days?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the time's right... Sure.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I can go there with respect...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon... You're my sister. You'll always get respect at my place.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't need to... I can go alone.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You came here alone, but I won't let you go back alone. Besides, it'll be so late when you get there...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, tell him he's staying with me for the night.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll stay with you as long as you want, okay?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only he listened to me so much!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that. I'm sure he always listens to you.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've gotta give that in writing, Uncle. So I can show Mum whenever she doubts me!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, Sakina. Bless you. Take care.
-Give my regards to everyone. Lots of love to Ashi and Naazi.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! I can't believe -- Guess who's here, Mum!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Aunt. This is for you and your daughter.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Novera. Waqas' cousin. I invited her in a hurry. Can't believe she's actually here!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera, Minahil. My sister.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi! How are you? Good to see you.
-Munni, Novera...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take her to Malika.
-Sure. Come.
-Take these.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it's her.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Waqas' cousin, remember?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's lovely... She looks well-to-do.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... She is, yeah...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll leave you to welcome the guests. Got a lot to do.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know if you need anything.
-Okay.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... Meet Novera. Aqil's friend.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, how are you?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look nice.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's so beautiful! I love it! Oh my God, these are so pretty!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This here's my work.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so creative!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've come earlier if I knew... To help you, you know.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've asked Aqil to bring you here if I knew about you!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, he didn't even invite me. I invited myself.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way. I know everything.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil likes you, of course!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? Who told you?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who talks about these things? It's all about reading the signs!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at this.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely, innit?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have let Novera go to Aqil's.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wanted to, Mum... Why should I stop her?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, he's after her like mad!

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that, Mum...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, really! He took her along for some ice cream that day, and now invited her! Why didn't he invite you?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's her mehndi... Just for the ladies...

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never been to his place... It'd be so awkward if I...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Call and tell her to go home quick.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be on her way.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Give me your phone. I'll call her.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'll talk to her.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Okay.
-Call her right now.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Novera. How's everything?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great! I'm having proper fun here!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should go back...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're really enjoying ourselves... Don't you think it's too early?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but it's so late... It ain't safe. I say you should get back.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Bye...

216
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,997
Lemme guess. Waqas.
-Yes. And now, I gotta go!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going back already?
-Actually, I think it's quite late.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I had proper fun here. Thank you.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea how we feel. You coming here and all!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I understand... I could sense it.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go see Aunt.
-Yeah, sure.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. You can always come to me.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be?

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?
-Hello... Am I talking to Malika's mother?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you calling me at this hour?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't look at the time when your honour is at stake.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it, again?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's mother.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you calling me right now?

231
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:32,443
I'd begged you to spare my son... You'd been kind to me... I thought it's time I repaid your kindness.

232
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:41,514
Some other day, perhaps... Please...
-I don't know if she's asked you or told you about it...

233
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:56,255
But, seeing her at a stranger's doorstep like that at midnight, I felt she'd made a run for it.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd tell you.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!
-What is it, Mum?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right h --
-Goodness...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M --

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's run away...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's mother called... Come with me. Quick!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me my shawl, Munni.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Lord...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what forced me to do this.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've been chained to that Asim forever if I didn't...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're safe here.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've put everything on the line. Because I trust you.

258
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:30,188
Do you regret it?

259
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,747
Not at all.

260
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:40,827
I don't regret it one bit. But please...

261
00:31:40,827 --> 00:31:45,238
Never let me regret my decision...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope no one saw you coming here?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody knows I'm here.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. Very good.

266
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:05,524
What's with this mehndi... This gown?

267
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:18,705
I had to... I could never break free if I didn't...

268
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,345
And Asim!

269
00:32:20,345 --> 00:32:25,025
I can't even imagine living with him!

270
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:29,966
And me?

271
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:34,696
I dream of it...

272
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:40,826
It's what gave me the courage to do it...

273
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:52,447
If you're worried, if the guest room feels suffocating to you... Feel free to come to my room.

274
00:32:52,447 --> 00:33:00,897
After we get married, sure. I'll live out my dream life with you.

275
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:05,809
Ah, yes... Of course... We'll get married.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep Malika safe, O Lord...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Malika, what've you done?

278
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:47,716
I swear I would've called the cops on you if I didn't care about my honour!

279
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:50,236
Keep your voice down.

280
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:56,088
Keep at it and I can call the cops on you too. For bulldozing me.

281
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:57,919
Where's Malika?

282
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:00,032
I'll effin' kill you!

283
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:02,827
Hold it!
-Don't you dare touch me! Get it?
-Aqil!

284
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,267
Take that bloodthirst somewhere else.

285
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:11,808
I'll break every bone in your body if you so much as touched her here!

286
00:34:11,808 --> 00:34:17,107
I never thought I'd live to see this day!

287
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:21,607
Were it not for my honour, I would've choked you right here!

288
00:34:21,607 --> 00:34:26,968
You choked me the day you shut all happiness out of my life!

289
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:33,088
I mean -- Asim! Ych a fi! I'd rather be buried alive!

290
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,877
Just wait until we get home! You may just get your wish!

291
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:43,168
Home? It's a blimmin' crypt where I've buried all my dreams!

292
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,638
Fine by me. I'm calling the cops.

293
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:49,977
What're you gonna tell them, eh? What've I done?

294
00:34:49,977 --> 00:34:53,278
I'm grown-up now! I can do as I chuffin' want!

295
00:34:53,278 --> 00:34:57,798
You still wanna call the cops? Be my guest! They'd love to feel your collar for forcing me!

296
00:34:57,798 --> 00:35:00,958
Just stop it!

297
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:05,149
I see... So it was all planned...

298
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:15,479
You pick out the big fish, send your daughters to them in the middle of the night, and come knocking when you know you have him! Shame on you!

299
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:22,398
Shut your gob! You come on to innocent girls and have the nerve to accuse us!

300
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:24,458
I didn't call her here.

301
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,368
She came here because she wanted to!

302
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:39,562
I just let her in so I can take her back first thing in the morning and save you from this humiliation. But you! You accuse me!

303
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:44,983
What are you talking about, Atif? I -- I'm here to get married -- to you!

304
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:49,799
Are you out of your mind? You better know your place!

305
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:55,589
I didn't call her here. There's nothing of the sort going on. She's all yours.

306
00:35:55,803 --> 00:36:01,410
Get a move on, already! Before they kick you out!

307
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:12,140
Don't you dare even talk to Malika again.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
