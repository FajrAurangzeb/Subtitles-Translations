1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so nervous?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I be?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my Aunt's only son, Asim.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Mum loves you so much too.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she does...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're also related in another way. I hope you remember that.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my brother-in-law to-be.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. You don't need to remind me.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw you with someone, Asim.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were with her in a restaurant.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, she's my colleague.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was throwing a party.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That better be it.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Aqil.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I thought.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew that you couldn't do anything of the sort.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think I was doubting you.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I've got to go. I'll get going.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to? Have some tea first.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, found a job?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying, mate...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Working on an assignment.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Uncle called.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's he? What did he say?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ask as if you care for him a lot!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's angry with you!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said, 'Noriyan doesn't even bother to call and ask his Uncle how he's doing'.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, he's right there...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call him today.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's insisting that I go to the village for a few days.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's missing me so much...

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You miss them, too.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should go.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum... You promised to Atif's parents that you'd take care of him...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not that you won't leave Atif even for a few days.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could've gone easily if he'd tied the knot.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't need to...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's always indulging himself and -- just -- having a jolly good time.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When a man without a household is freed from all worries, he starts enjoying his own undoing.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, but why are you telling me?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd get married the day you tell me to.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make a place for yourself first.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif said he'd get me a good job once I've graduated.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you study so much if Atif's going to get you a job?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just degrees don't help you land the job, Mum.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif's got so many contacts...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll save me the trouble if he helped me get a job...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told your Uncle that you're coming too.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because why not? He'd be chuffed.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a deal.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll borrow Atif's car and take you there, okay?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need for any of that! There's no shortage of buses that go that way!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get on a bus whenever I want to go. And you'll be coming with me.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Borrow his car'!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Aqil want to talk about?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really, Mum.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't nothing, Asim.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had his suspicions...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suspicions?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of suspicions?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of my colleagues... She took me to a restaurant for lunch...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil saw us there.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe a lech who mooches about all day has got the guts to suspect you!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never mind, Mum...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? I'll talk to Zahida. Wasn't he ashamed to even think of it?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For God's sake, Mum, please don't talk to her.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd feel just as bad as you right now.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you actually didn't mind it?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt great.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doubted me because he cares for Malika.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm her future.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't Aunt always say Aqil doesn't care about his family?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some salad.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same as you.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm missing you.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm missing you, too.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please forgive me. For the last time?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can be so sensitive at times...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought about it...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All you said...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was out of love...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to hurt me...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I can't even think of hurting you.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know how far I've come?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much that I seem to have forgotten the difference in our status.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot that your type

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can buy my love for a few pennies.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please stop it...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much more will you embarrass me in my eyes?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea how much I've suffered.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one I loved...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Considered my dignity so insignificant...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be coming tomorrow.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we'll spend the whole day together.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be waiting.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, Mum, isn't his bike just awesome?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gave me a ride yesterday.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Riding freebies, eh?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But nobody seems to bat an eyelid.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine the stooshie if I'd brought something one of my friends had given me!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But who'll scold sweet little Aqil?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never supported anything Aqil does. But the two of you do as you please.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know who's sent that bike. One of his friends he's up chatting with late into the night!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See that? She knows everything!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she won't say a word!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the difference between a son and a daughter!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can give Aqil an earful if I want, but I don't want to create a scene here!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me my breakfast.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil! You parked your bike in front of Shakil's home.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Mum said they're having trouble going in and out!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you be careful?
-They're just envious...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They couldn't even dream of such a bike.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The neighbours and the family.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not everyone's got friends with benefits...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut your gob already...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and help Munni in the kitchen.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You weren't here when we got back. I heard you had a meeting with Mr Farooq?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There were some issues in the purchases department, so I was with him...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have done it...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh --

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to go because of the call...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not talking about that.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lunch was on me...

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It didn't seem right that you should pay.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've refused...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did, but you insisted so much.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you switch your phone off at home? I want to talk to you so much!

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We get enough time here. If someone caught me talking to you, you can kiss your chance here goodbye too, sweetie.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, your family's so conservative.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So many restrictions... Just... Jeez...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They haven't a clue about their daughter's dreams.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how hard it was to convince them to let me go to college.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to get you out of this jail quick.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're helpless too, I don't think I'll have my chance.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll bring Mum to your place right after the finals.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can find a job later.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, why are you so much into getting a job?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about your business?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Touché.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your ride today?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My bike. Why?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just askin'.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can bring my car tomorrow if we're going somewhere.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to go somewhere very far away with you.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Free from all worries...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't even let me drop you home. That's why I've stopped bringing my car.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know my situation, Noriyan...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say I bring my car tomorrow? We'll go somewhere. I'll even drop you home.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you take me home?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's one condition.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell Mum, 'Meet your daughter-in-law'! She's staying here. Don't let her go anywhere.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get thrown out with me if you said that!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sometimes wonder what Aunt would be like to meet me...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she didn't like her daughter-in-law to-be is so easy-going?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then again, I'm sure it's no big deal among those of your class.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Class', 'class', 'class', 'class', 'class'... Jeez, mate, stop it...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many times do you have to say it?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Put it aside, will you?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, sorry...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Where are we going tomorrow?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chinese restaurant.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My favourite.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waiting for tomorrow...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd briefed you on everything the client said. You know what kind of a face we want for the brand ambassador.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think any of them could be our brand ambassador? Not one, innit?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's into acting these days.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After all these years with me, I hope you have a good idea of how we select.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've wasted your time doing all of this...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, wrap it up.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay sir...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea why you just don't seem to understand...

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought Malika would be back by now.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be on her way. Munni's inside, studying. She's joined this computer institute.
-Really? Wow...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask her to get tea.
-Please, Aunt, let her study.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I'm not in any mood for tea.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim told me Munni's a good student.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She works hard.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord reward her with success.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'll ace her exams with straight-A*s.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get her into university.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Aqil try for a job?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know him. He won't settle for any job.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's plain silly! He's your only son. It's his responsibility.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not everyone's like your son...

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All thanks to your prayers. He's your son, too.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course...
-By the way, when did Aqil buy that bike?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He -- no -- It's his friend's.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Aqil though?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He went into his room after breakfast.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just woke up!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go meet him.
-Tell him his Aunt's here. I'll be coming in if he doesn't show up!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can be such a bother...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously though, Zahida, if he's friends so well off, why can't he ask for their help in getting a job?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He feels ashamed to talk about it.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought we'd visit Lahore this weekend.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a lot going on that I have to resolve personally.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think that's a great idea. I want to see Mr Ahmed too.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you say? Should I book tickets for Saturday?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me a day.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me settle some things here.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you tomorrow.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way,

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been busy talking to Hassan yesterday.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're serious, just get things going!

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you crazy?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you find anyone better than that loser?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know, he's so negative!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you've been talking to that loser who's always negative all night?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just being a good host!

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes, I can see that...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, did he tell you why he left his second wife?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ran off!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With one of her servants!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God...

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hats off to her though. She put up with that madman for so long...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what might've pushed her...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing pushed her.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ran off because she wanted to.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this loser tells everyone, 'So what? We just didn't get along'!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you want to make your cousin his third wife?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crazy...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's quite the character, I tell you.
-Yeah...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going somewhere?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you all day? Not a clue here...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim...

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're too upright...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get it.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt worries for you.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't solve her worries.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I got a good job, it's not like I'd let it go!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until then... Isn't some job better than no job?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What do you want?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanna see me as a salesman? A watchman? Maybe at a service-station?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so negative?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because they're just mocking or lecturing all the time.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm like your brother.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Asim...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not talking about you.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But everyone else... They just say one thing every time.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'When are you getting a job'?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil, they care for you.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They know what your Dad used to do. What your Mum does. They know she works so hard.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They just try to open your eyes.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Care'!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ain't no care.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeering is more like it.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Folks just need excuses...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... How say... I check where I work?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? I'll take it if it's good.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright. I'll get going.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Zoha...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were so disturbed because of me...

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You punished me for too long...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess it was my fault...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. You never punish those you love.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our bond is so unique...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't live together, can't live apart...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not together?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you trust me?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You felt bad I came to the gym.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because they were all looking at me?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just looking.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was worried their gaze may curse us... Our love...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't expect that from you...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a lot going in my life...

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A lot of worries...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess that's why...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm too harsh on you...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please... Don't mind it...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm always with you, Aqil.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never think you're alone.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no shortage of girls, Zoha. Really.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thousands would die to be friends with me.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never think of them.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got my one.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who stands by me. Always.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm always with you, Aqil.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough already, Zahida. I want to take my jewel home.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Salma... I can't send her just yet. I haven't got anything.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying? It's not like Malika will ever be leaving home.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll just be leaving yours for mine. Don't worry.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't seem right to send her empty-handed...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've worked hard to educated your kids.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think there can be a better gift.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might've been less worried if Aqil had done his part...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm telling you, Zahida, I don't want anything in dowry.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim's salary and my savings should be enough to get some new furniture for them.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...
-But nothing.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to take Malika with me.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, but let her finish her education...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like I'm stopping her.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey there, how are you?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Long time no see.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the meaning of all of this, Malika?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you dart in like that?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at her, I know what she's up to!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Up to'?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was talking about your marriage.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plotting against me, so to speak!

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind your tongue.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell her to forget about it.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you want to drive a wedge between me and my only sister?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't your children matter to you?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how I feel sometimes.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better go and tell Aunt --

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what? Was it something I said?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aunt...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and help Munni in the kitchen.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up, Zahida?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me. As my sister, not Malika's Mum.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika doesn't want to get married just yet.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry though.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give her some time...

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, everything's gonna be alright.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask Asim to get some bread. Meanwhile, you can fry these kebabs.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still hanging about?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd pay a visit when you didn't come...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I got back from the university early.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not talking about university. I'm talking about home.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I say something?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such a shoddy attempt at romance!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why must you insult me every single moment?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, I was just being honest.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you find it insulting, I can try lying.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a bike ride!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seemed more afraid than me!

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I wasn't...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I was a bit afraid for you... You were on a bike with me for the first time.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if something happened?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wasn't afraid at all.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you wouldn't let anything happen to me.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll always care for you like that.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More than that.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I want... To be with you forever.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll be together forever.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, the food's delicious.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Specially for you. All organic, made by me.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I know how much you care about your health.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You care for me so much.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for everything.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't settle for just a thanks. You have to promise me...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me you'll never be angry with me.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that depends on your behaviour.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've I done that you're so angry about?
-I'm just kidding, mate...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better be.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's one last gift I've got for you... My favourite...

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you like it.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open it!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Zoha... This is very expensive...

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more valuable than you...

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but still --
-No. Please. Put it on.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How does it look?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is so beautiful.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suits you.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're most welcome.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cheers.
-Cheers.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Mum...

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt says she'll talk to Malika.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's hurt me so much.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such pride!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll come crashing down, Asim!

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just naïve.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She doesn't care for anyone in the world. She didn't talk to me for a minute, and told Zahida she doesn't want to get married just yet!

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you, too.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think she doesn't intend to get married, like, ever.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not that, Mum...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just wants to finish her education.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid... I wonder what kind of education it is that's making her lose all respect for elders!

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum, just leave it... Let it go...

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If they don't want her married to you, they better come out openly. There's no shortage of matches for you.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum, why'd Malika --
-You can get to buying your car. I'll get my money back in a couple of days.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd save it for your marriage, but I don't think it's on the cards anymore.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening, Atif.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening. Come, it's dinner time!

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have it later.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just sit down. Get a plate for him.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing special. How about you?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just fantastic...
-Noriyan...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked him to sit.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come and have dinner with us.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks, I'll pass.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's your semester going?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great, Atif.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you do me a favour...?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd need your car tomorrow. The small one.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you going?
-Not too far. Just near the highway. With some friends.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back before the evening.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no issues. It's parked at home all day anyway.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can take it everyday!

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the best, Atif!

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Busted.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here. Try this.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust me, Mum, Atif told me to sit down!

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you did.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I can't turn him down.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lying again!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you won't let go of a chance to sit with him, have dinner with him... Behave like his equal!

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that, Mum!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
However did you think I want to behave like his equal?

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I tell you not to ask Atif for the car?

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't it enough that he's given you a bike?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need a car tomorrow.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm...

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Taking your daughter-in-law to-be...

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On a long drive.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm kidding!

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going out with friends.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can ask Asif and Farhan if you like!

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I?

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't this...

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What Asim's given you?

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you taking them out?

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it already, you blimmin' Old Bill!

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes, it's his. I'm throwing everything out.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've had these for years and -- they're from Asim!

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni, I don't give two hoots about your sweet Asim's gifts.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no interest in any of these or him.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm stashing them away in the loft.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and put my pot on!

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poison Mum's ears!

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Asim say sorry, Sana?

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What for?

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry with him!

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'm not?

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, you aren't? Lunch was on you, he paid the bill and all, remember?

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talked to him about it.
-And he didn't get a clue you're angry with him.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Farah, I told you I'm not angry with him.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. You should only be angry with someone who'll make it up to you.

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That man's got no feelings!

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I like about him...

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He isn't bold like most men.

499
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:46,303
C'mon, Sana... A man should have the guts to realise he's liked!

500
00:33:46,303 --> 00:33:48,723
But he's got a heart of stone!

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hem hem!

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing?

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you know Sana's cross with you?

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No! Not at all. You know she says just about anything! Give me the file over there. Quickly!

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some breakfast.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You skipped it yesterday too!

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't leave food like that. It's so disrespectful.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mum... Sweetening up to me first thing in the morning, eh?

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your mother. Not your enemy.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I only want the best for you.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to be happy.

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'd gotten you engaged to Asim.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everyone's got dreams... Wishes...

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, believe me,

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My experience tells me

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be happy with Asim.

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get to live out all your dreams, fulfil all your wishes.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Experience, Mum, can be sooo misleading at times.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I think in Asim's case.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen enough.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway. I'll get going.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be late today. I've got extra classes.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Finish your breakfast. Don't leave it.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time flies when I'm with you! Really!

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time flies at its own pace, sir.

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I want time to stop.

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here. Right now.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're going to introduce me to Aunt, right?

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. We're going to your place, right?

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talked to Mum... She said she'd come to your place to meet you.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she'd rather not that you come to our place to meet her.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told Mum about me?

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even told her I'm going on a romantic date with her daughter-in-law to-be.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she think?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That university's just her daughter-in-law to-be's excuse to date her son?

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're all rebels in love.

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, when should I bring Mum to your place?

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not now, Noriyan.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me convince Mum first.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a tip. Just let Mum and me come.

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll convince your family.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it, Noriyan.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Mum's not like your Mum!

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be quite the job to convince her.

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try, Malika!

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but I'm afraid...

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She may just get me out of university!

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Malika. It can't be that bad. Just take one step.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The two of you will bring shame on me one day!

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're never happy, are you, Mum?

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's such a nice bike. You should be blessing me, praying that I climb higher, but you... Jeez... Lecturing and lecturing and lecturing!

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Climb higher'?

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
New friends, new troubles?

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Aunt, Mum.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at? Go.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A Zoha was calling you.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many times have I told you not to check my phone?

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you!

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let it ring!

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get going!

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did Noriyan lie to me if he knew her so well?

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
