1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes...</i>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think she doesn't love me?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could see all her love shatter when she found out you were the maid's son!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she found out you were not the rich lady's son as you told her...

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she found out you were just the lowly maid's son!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you couldn't see it...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If --

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if --

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if Malika confessed her love before you?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you still have a problem?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about me, she won't even confess her love before you!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, you gotta take a chance...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd send her off right now if I could have my way!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?
-That's the problem!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe he's panting for someone else after getting engaged to Malika!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone else?
-You heard it.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She works with him and she's started paying them visits!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen it myself!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Salma?
-She knows everything.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says she's just Asim's colleague. But...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I smell something shady!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma wants to make Malika her daughter-in-law.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I've seen Asim's love for her.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika doesn't care for any of that...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll suffer all her life! I tell you!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought Malika's refusal would make Salma budge.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've got me worried.
-There's only one way out, Mum.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to Malika. Get some sense into her!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll suffer all her life if she didn't listen!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep an eye on her.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make sure she doesn't talk to Noriyan again!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even talk about him.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you take my call?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to have anything to do with you!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're asking me!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't Mummy tell you?
-What'd she say?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika --

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing left for me to say.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say Malika's love for Noriyan died when she found out who he was!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika, I told you about it!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even try it. I'd never love a maid's son!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just forget me!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you crazy? How could I --

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan, I guess?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even mention his name!

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, that's some real hatred. I thought you said your heart beats to the sound of his name!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You here to rub salt in my wounds?

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted to ask you if you actually loved him or --

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I took everything because I loved him!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme get this straight - your love bugged out when you found out he's the maid's son.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up or you won't like what I do to you!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway. I told you Asim's so nice... But you hurt him.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt called just now. Told he's been promoted.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the dickens with him.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After all that's happened?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, newsflash! Mr Goody Two-shoes has already given someone else my place in his life!

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can't believe it, sweetie, go and ask Aqil. He'll tell you everything.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's mistaken. Asim ain't that sort!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly? I'm delighted.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good for him.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, go and congratulate him for me, will you?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's sorry for everything, Mum... You should patch up with her.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take it that she's sorry when she says she accepts Asim.

73
00:07:05,617 --> 00:07:07,987
I don't think that's ever gonna happen...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I guess she isn't sorry for everything then.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you going to Aunt's?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going tomorrow. With some sweets.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For Asim's promotion?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the promotion, and because Malika didn't let him take Asim's place.

80
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,602
You can be so strange sometimes, Mum...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I asked something?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika said Asim loves someone else?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always seen Asim as a son. I know him. No one can take Malika's place in his heart.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to me.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, he's hiding something!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think it's just because Malika ain't here.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do I get a feeling he's found out about her?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just look at him!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He cut classes today!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say we ask him?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think Malika's coming to university again.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we both know how much she was into studies!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you call her?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're friends. You can tell us about it. What happened?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You guys were right...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought love was powerful... But she was so put out to hear my truth!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told her everything?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I think I should've told her earlier. Maybe it wouldn't have hurt her so much...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you blaming yourself? Big deal. It ain't nothin' she couldn't forgive in love.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only she took my call... Talked to me!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can say sorry to her.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think she'll ever talk to you again.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wanted to be with me all her life.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I... said something?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't deserve you.
-Shut your gob!
-Hey!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down!
-My blood boils when you say that!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hammer some sense into him!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always saying the wrong thing!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why, Zahida?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so delighted when Asim called. God bless him.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All thanks to Him.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought sweets for us when he got a car.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought it's my turn now.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All thanks to your prayers.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my nephew, after all. Dearer to me than Aqil.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd Asim be back, Aunt?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be on his way.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here. Try some.
-Okay.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When will Aqil wake up? How can he get to the top if he didn't even start climbing?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm tired of telling him... But he doesn't listen... Just like Malika. God, help me...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd her exams go?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great. She's learning sewing and cutting from me these days.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should let her study if she wants to.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. I had no problems with Malika either.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had no problems with her going to university. But, who knows...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call Asim. Ask him to get something.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you don't like to hear her name.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure you can bless her...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if that's all she needed?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurt me a lot, Zahida, but I'm happy it saved us from going the wrong way.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very sorry...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Matches are made in Heaven. We can't help it.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I have no complaints with you.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't see Aunt around?

145
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,640
My, you're not the lamb you look like!

146
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:57,612
What do you mean?

147
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:04,395
You know very well that Mum and Munni have gone to your place. But you dropped in here!

148
00:13:06,081 --> 00:13:12,298
It's not like I have to come here to see you when no one's around.

149
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:15,869
Let's not forget I never let it be that way.

150
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,270
Anyway, I've been promoted.

151
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,998
This is for Aunt.

152
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:26,468
Definitely not the lamb you look like!

153
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:31,229
You never let go of a chance to score brownie points with Mum, do you?

154
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:37,409
It's my love, Malika. I even got some for you.

155
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:42,309
Jeez, what are you?

156
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:50,699
I don't need you or your gifts. Take them away.

157
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:56,130
You don't bring gifts because they need them. You do because you need them.

158
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,415
Well then, could you please stop needing me? Like, forever?

159
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,646
Goodbye.

160
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:12,866
Go and give these to your sweetheart who's started coming over.

161
00:14:13,116 --> 00:14:14,707
Who?

162
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:18,653
Blimey -- Sana?

163
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,243
She's just a colleague!

164
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,393
I don't wanna know!

165
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:30,293
She was checking on Mum! Just once!

166
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,713
I don't give two hoots.

167
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:40,993
She's welcome at your place anytime she wants! Give these to her. I'm sure she'd love it!

168
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:50,264
Blimey, what is he?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

172
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:10,366
Miss me? Or have you been too busy being all lovey-dovey...

173
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,634
Of course. How are you?

174
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:16,554
All alone... Well, who cares...

175
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:18,584
Anyway, congratulations!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your decision.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You decided to forget your future and get married.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've changed course.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe it.

182
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:38,322
When do I come?

183
00:15:38,322 --> 00:15:44,693
You don't need to ask. You're always welcome here.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright? You sound worried.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.
-It's okay if you don't want to tell me...

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a feeling you're a bit sad.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you tomorrow.

189
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,313
Okie doke...

190
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,914
A day's wait it is.

191
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:10,178
Okay, bye.

192
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,064
Bye.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tears drip slowly...</i>

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you not to act like I'm yours! We're just cousins. Get it?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My eyes grow lonely</i>

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yearning to see you</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come here, my dear</i>

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yea, just you...</i>

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You illuminate</i>

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All my dreams</i>

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Let us live them out</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Together...</i>

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Teary eyes</i>

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I've lost everything</i>

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Everything</i>

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Teary eyes...</i>

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've already told Aunt all I have to say about it.
<i>Teary eyes...</i>

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just honoured my love...
<i>With teary eyes</i>

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just honoured my love...
<i>Teary eyes</i>

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum always thought you hated me and you proved her right.
<i>With teary eyes</i>

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum always thought you hated me and you proved her right.
<i>I've lost everything</i>

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe it if you still can't.
<i>I've lost everything</i>

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe it if you still can't.
<i>Everything</i>

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe it if you still can't.
<i>With teary eyes</i>

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

219
00:17:56,635 --> 00:18:02,896
I'm sure I'll find my Prince Charming if you kept your doomy self at an arm's length.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Slowly</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>We've grown apart</i>

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How will I cross this new divide?</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Slowly</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You've slipped from my hands</i>

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How did we drift so far away?</i>

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Glancing you even from this distance</i>

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Makes my heart skip a beat...</i>

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You illuminate</i>

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All my dreams</i>

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Let us live them out</i>

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Together...</i>

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Teary eyes</i>

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes</i>

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I've lost everything</i>

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Everything</i>

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With teary eyes...</i>

238
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:04,029
Asim, I can't stand this blather.

239
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:09,544
You better show up only when you can get gold bangles instead of these garlands.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't expect any love from <i>me</i>.</i>

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's got the right to wish to live, and you're the only reason I'm alive.

242
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:42,968
Bless him.

243
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,928
He's such a lovely kid.

244
00:19:47,898 --> 00:19:54,709
He's only been hurt here... But he never leaves us out...

245
00:19:54,709 --> 00:20:03,204
I pulled him up today. 'You never let go of a chance to score brownie points with Mum, do you?'

246
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,847
I dare not imagine what you would've said to him!

247
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:09,505
Blimey, he's so pig-headed!

248
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,164
What'd he get you?

249
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:15,895
So he told you already!

250
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,774
No. He didn't.

251
00:20:18,774 --> 00:20:25,186
But I know he can't forget about you.

252
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:33,137
Aye, pig-headed as I told you. Brought something junky, as usual.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt. It's Sana.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great, Aunt.

257
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:04,175
Congratulations on Asim -- uh -- Mr Asim's promotion. Gotta get used to calling him 'sir' now!

258
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:08,895
That may be, but you'll always be like my daughter.

259
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,436
Thank you, Aunt. You're too kind.

260
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:15,675
I just called to congratulate you.
-Thank you.

261
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,066
Bye, Aunt.

262
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,076
Bye.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been?

265
00:21:24,715 --> 00:21:28,105
Just thought I'd get some air.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've been congratulating me, but you don't look like you've been promoted.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm delighted, Mum...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahida called me. She said you'd gone over to her. What's it with Malika this time?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go change.
-Sana congratulated you too.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she'd already congratulated me.
-Not me though!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd she get your number?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave her my number when she came here.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to have some lunch?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not hungry...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope she hasn't mocked you for being a maid's son!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She already did, that day...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How does she know you're the maid, though?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even want to talk to me.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

283
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:43,621
Does love really care about status so much?

284
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:59,632
No.

285
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:02,183
If it is indeed love, no.

286
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:13,364
But when someone uses you to live out her dreams, know that she loves her dreams and not you...

287
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:17,156
I think Malika just loved her dreams...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She could've given me one chance! Just one... I could've fulfilled every dream she had...

289
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:39,156
If she had to depend on you for it, believe me, she would've wanted everything in one shot! She was not one who could wait!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows I can't live without her...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe --

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never felt any pity...

295
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:18,517
When a son starts crying for someone like that before his Mum, she loses her faith in her son.

296
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:25,616
I had so much faith in her...

297
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:30,305
I trusted her!

298
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:35,024
I told you she doesn't deserve your trust!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you didn't listen to me...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

301
00:25:55,117 --> 00:26:09,179
Life tires those who give up in times of trial. You can't rebuild if you don't learn from it. Okay?

302
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:14,478
Mum...

303
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,259
Please...

304
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,320
Pray for me...

305
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,150
Pray that she changes her mind...

306
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:34,470
I will pray that the Lord change your mind.

307
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:40,237
I can't live without her.

308
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:51,817
You got to live without those who were never destined for you willy-nilly.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, seriously?

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd come here, Mum would fix the date, and we'd get married.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I love you?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well... That's quite a shock...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you know about me that you love me so much?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you love me?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want to marry me?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like you, you're honest, nice... That's why I decided to get engaged to you.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not get married, then?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just need some time?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much, and why?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, if you wanna get engaged, why not just get married?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you in a hurry?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've just come here.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me some time to settle in here, figure things out...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's so much I have to plan.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you don't love me?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like you. You're my cousin.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided to get engaged to you too.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But marriage... It's such a big commitment! I need time to think.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Waqas!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw your car outside, figured I should check if you're on a date or something...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's -- Novera -- Uncle Faizan's daughter...

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean her?

337
00:28:58,618 --> 00:29:00,983
Mlle Novera l'Aloé Véra?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meet Aqil. My best friend.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, what's with that drab voice? Starvin', eh?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme fill you in. He ain't just my best friend. He's my only best friend!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're gym buddies too. No secrets from each other. Which is how I know all about you.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Including that all he's been dreaming of since you got here... Is getting married to you!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My bad.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'm disturbing you...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just saw the car outside and thought... Enjoy the date!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess he was so blunt because he's your best friend?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry... I'll talk to him.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About what?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This kinda banter... Not good.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's your best friend... I don't think it's bad...

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's so frank with you because you're so frank with him.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm also sure you talk to him about everything.

358
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:50,883
No.

359
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:52,234
Not really...

360
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:55,754
He just says anything sometimes... Most of the time...!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... So you mean you didn't talk to him about me and he was lying.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do talk about you sometimes.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray tell what you say about me?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're confusing me.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! How are you?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, sweetheart! So you're back!
-Yeah. Just landed.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Called you first thing.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Felt like it's been ages!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I missed you so much!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really! I missed you too.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, get back quick. I'm waiting in your lounge.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to stop at Bukhari for half an hour before I get back.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Zoha... Back to work before you're back here? What about me getting bored to death here?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't take too long. I'll call when I'm free. Okay?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at the timing! We got here at the same time!

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Been waiting for me?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back after ages.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've missed you so much.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Same here.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were busy every second.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I wanted you to come with me. You could see how busy I was!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think, Zoha? I didn't want to come with you?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it were up to me, I'd spend every moment of my life with you.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what always draws me to you.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I think... How can you even love me so much?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you make me want to live...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You make me feel important, valued...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel special.
-You are special.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very special.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what kind of moron would not love you.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The shopping -- Was fabulous.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you went shopping?

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Just a bonus.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, blimey, the trip was so productive!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... By the way, was Zahir with you?

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahir's vanished into thin air! I'll ask him when he's back.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going with your sister's marriage?

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're meeting after ages...

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't we just talk about us?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring the table here.
-Yes, ma'am.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's have lunch here.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please get us our lunch here, Ghulam Hussain.
-As you wish, ma'am.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd pick that. Your favourite.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know me so well.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, and so does Ghulam Hussain!

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'With BEST WISHES'

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'CONGRATULATIONS SIR.
~FROM SANA.'

418
00:35:58,139 --> 00:35:59,960
What is this, Sana?

419
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,825
A small gift, sir. On your promotion.

420
00:36:04,825 --> 00:36:05,876
But why?

421
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:10,717
As a colleague, sir...?

422
00:36:10,717 --> 00:36:25,422
Blimey, Sana... You're giving me gifts now... Coming to my place... Getting close to Mum... 'As a colleague'? Seriously? Just -- Why?

423
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:28,232
I'm sorry, sir.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww... C'mon... No need to cry.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please get her some water, Asif.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what...

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last time you were here, I wanted to stop you.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've stopped me.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how? You were so intoxicated with love!

430
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:16,824
My biggest mistake!

431
00:37:18,045 --> 00:37:20,996
What? He deserted you?

432
00:37:20,996 --> 00:37:23,181
No. I deserted him!

433
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:26,956
Oh... That's really sad.

434
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:29,487
Wicked!

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't deserve my love.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always thought he's lucky.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask something?

439
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:02,104
Do you love anyone else?

440
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:07,174
I mean -- Would you allow anyone else...?

441
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,914
What do you mean?

442
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:11,187
I mean...

443
00:38:11,187 --> 00:38:19,354
If, somehow, we had an understanding... That... Perhaps, somewhere down the line... Gave way to love?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
