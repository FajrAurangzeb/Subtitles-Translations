1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd call and ask if Monsieur's fixed his mood, but thought I'd rather drop by.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to ask.
-That's why I'm here.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You get angry for nothing. Like a kid.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum says you should be thankful if you've got someone who's angry with you.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't you think you should be all the more thankful if you've got someone ready to make it up to you?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't that what you do? When you've made a mistake? Because it's your mistake?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what've I done that you're so angry about?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should've been angry with you, because you left me alone. I had to go there alone! Without you!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you have to go at all?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm not like you, okay?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be sorry you couldn't attend the wedding of your best friend's sister, but you're angry because I went there?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I be sorry?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil doesn't give two hoots if I attend his sister's wedding or not.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, they'd be glad I didn't show up. I know what it's like. If I drop by, they get worried where they could have me sit!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... He was never sorry living on my money!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that about your best friend.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He's my best friend. I know him inside out.</i>

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't even bother to ask me why I wasn't there! He never forgot to come to me when he needed help!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's oh-so-lovely of him!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You positively hate everything about him! How is he your best friend then?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you can call him your best friend. He's been to your place. You've talked to him about me. How could he be your friend if you loathe him so much?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never said one bad word about you. He speaks quite highly of you.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It pains me to see how you want to show off that you've helped him arrange his sister's wedding.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's true...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking at my future. Would you have me account for everything after our marriage, too?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you won't even listen to me after our marriage?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it's just the wife's duty to obey orders, while the husband can order her around as he likes, pull her up when he wants? Is that what you're telling me?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how it is here.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got you! See!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take it seriously, I'll be a good, understanding husband.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. I'm sure.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go have something. I get this peckish feeling when I'm angry.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thanks. I don't feel like eating anything right now.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry. Cheeks -- Going red -- You -- You're getting angry now!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, let's go.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You created quite a situation, though...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not afraid of any 'situation'. I trust the One who can help us out.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way you're working now, Mum.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've talked about tuitions. I should be able to start in a few days.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Focus on your studies.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a good job at the factory. No issues there.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum --
-We need a long-term solution, Noriyan. Focus on your studies for now.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look for a job later.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'd get one anytime...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It takes years, if not months, to find a good job.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure the Lord will help you.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to start doing something before Ashi comes here.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashi?

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus -- You're still thinking of her?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who should I think of?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Certainly not the one even you've got no reason to think of now!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to get married, Mum. I'm not thinking of anyone!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way... When I'm not around. But while I'm hanging back, let me tell you - Ashi's the one for you.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why, Mum?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I've got only one son, Noriyan,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I can't see him become a hermit because of some snooty Malika.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've ironed my clothes, Mum.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me yours.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't really feel like going... Haven't got the courage.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Don't you always talk about being brave? And -- What'd they think?
-She'd hate it if I were there.</i>

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to go either. But what about Asim? And Aunt?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If we didn't even show up at the reception, they'd think we were just waiting to get rid of Malika!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're wise. I'm sure they know everything by now.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd hold a daughter who's disgraced the family dear?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum... Please get ready... Or Malika will be certain that we despise her.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to drown in shame than think that her mother could despise her.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kids may fall from grace... But their mothers never despise them.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then please get ready, Mum... And bless her.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks they're like curses...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll grow to think of them as her most valuable gift one day.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, Aqil already said he's not going.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We ought to. C'mon. Get ready.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!
-Munni!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! What happened? Sit.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heavens...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lie down.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Water...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Mum?
-I'm fine...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just got a bit dizzy...
-I'll call Aqil...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need... I'm fine...
-No, you're not.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something wrong with the network... Can't even get through now!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be fine, Munni...
-Look at yourself, Mum! You're so cold...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?
-It's Minahil.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, how are you?
-D'you know where Aqil would be?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. What happened? Everything alright?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's not well. Got no word from Aqil...
-Don't worry. I'll get to him...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get you some lemonade...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Going somewhere?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Dad... Minahil just called... Aqil's sister? His Mum's not really well... And he's not home. I gotta go. They're so worried.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. Why do you have to go? Just call Waqas.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you're right... I'll call him...
-Okay.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not satisfied with the sales team's performance. Always making excuses about the competition...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...
-Waqas...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Minahil just called. Her Mum's not really well.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Minahil?
-Munni! Aqil's sister.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd she call you?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's not home. Do you have any idea where he could be?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, but let me try.
-I already did. His phone's switched off.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera... I'm in a meeting right now... Give me a minute...

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

118
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,648
Dad. I have to go myself. Bye.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
