1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It seems so selfish...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't care one bit about me... Even after everything I've done for you...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all about give and take, you know...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask me, there's a simple formula to fulfil every dream...

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to come back when you've understood it.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would Asim and Aunt agree after all that's happened?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They will.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who care for their family can forgive and forget everything.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want any favours.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope we're clear that I'm never saying yes to him!
-I hope we're clear, too, that I may not be able to save you again.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're creating trouble for yourself.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's right...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I created this problem...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's up to me to solve it!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and tell Aunt...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no problem...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you hear what I heard?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Aunt, quick.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What made her change her mind?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Mum! Just call Aunt. Asim would be at home. It'd be great if he heard it too!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call her in the morning.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum... Now --
-I told you I'll call her in the morning. Tidy this up, okay?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!
-For what?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Aunt called at last!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does she say?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What Aqil told you.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika has no problem now.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? Wow!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's hope it's the best for all of us.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why don't you seem happy?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not it... It's just... A strange fear... No idea why... Ever since you told me she's okay with it...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you worried about, Granny?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and Malika are poles apart! Ask your Mum if you don't believe me!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... Please don't talk about Mum...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks Sana's the only match for me in the entire world!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even start...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to hear you comparing Sana with Malika.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen anyone like her.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just mistaken about her.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you Malika'd said it without thinking.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves me!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm sure we'd be very happy together.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'd only be happy with her. That's why I always prayed that the Lord show her the way.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope your prayers work.
-May the Lord keep the two of you happy.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're angry because Aqil met me and I didn't tell you?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've had no problem if you told me, but Aqil! I was so furious when he told me!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Problem'? What kind of problem? He just bumped into me and couldn't say know, because he's your best friend, right?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly! He's my best friend! What's he to you? Nobody!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What...?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this nonsense? I was just being polite?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Novera, let me try to explain it.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know the people here. You don't know what they're like.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I don't know what they're like? Or are you just too wrong?
-Blimey, you're out to prove me wrong!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you shouting?
-Cripes! I'm not shouting! I'm not shouting, okay!?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry!

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted to tell you they're not what they look like!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not trying to explain anything, you're just trying to set my boundaries!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you please not be so wrong about me for once?
-You are wrong!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not wrong! You talked to Aqil about us! Told him everything! Why'd you tell Aqil I'm possessive? That I don't give you space, I force my will on you? Tell me!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is too much! I gotta leave. I just can't understand you. Bye!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Novera --

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just gotta go, Aunt. I've got something important to do. I gotta leave. Bye, Aunt! Take care!
-You can't just leave like that! But --

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something happened here?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, she's a weird one!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Try to tell her something and she flares up!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you to tell her anything?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted to tell her not to talk to Aqil about us!

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did she meet Aqil?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bumped into him at the mall.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must've introduced her to him.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many times have I told you to stay away from him? He's a proper clever lad!
-Please stay out of it, Mum... I'll talk to her!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better not hear you've had a row again!
-Yeah yeah!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta listen to those you love, Novera...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Dad...

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if they're just plain wrong?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've made him understand. You didn't have to be angry with him.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's so irritating, Dad...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what if he feels the same way?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Just hear him out, and try to tell him your side of the story, okay?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To get angry and leave is the coward's way out.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just be brave and make him understand.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here. Sit.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're very wise...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're not at that point in life where you have to compromise on your principles for someone, give up your independence to show you're serious about your relationship.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Dad, but don't you think it's a bit too early?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He expects so much from me... I need some time to understand him.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know why?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves you. Loves you so much, I tell you! You're his world!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Just look at him! He's so excited!

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He already thinks of you as his life partner.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try and understand his point of view, his side of the story too.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's few who love you so much, and fewer who'd face any challenge to get you with a smile.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just because they love you.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to understand his point of view, okay?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He tried to explain it to you because he loves you.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Dad... I'll say sorry to him.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's my girl.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back.
-Okay.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Yeah, Sumeyra!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Novera back?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she is.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did she say anything about Waqas?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. It happens with the kids...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so worried you may be angry.
-What are you saying?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas is just like my son!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas says he's hurt her. He'll say sorry to her.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what Novera thinks too! She'll say sorry too!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good they've patched up. I'm so relaxed now. Thank you.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. All will be well. Thank you. Bye.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't believe it when Asim told me why Aqil had come!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe how it happened either...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's fix the wedding date. I say you shouldn't wait around too much.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any day you say.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see... It's Tuesday... How about Friday?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They can get married in the morning and you can take her home by the evening.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This Friday?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, there's so much to do!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we ought to hurry up, or you'll get busy arranging for her dowry! No way I'm allowing that!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's right. I told you I want nothing.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, but I can't send her off empty-handed.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, Mum. I've saved enough to get everything she needs in a day.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we've got to invite everyone!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just call them!

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got a point. We shouldn't wait around too much.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, explain it to Mum.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going. Okay, Asim?
-Okay.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's right. You can call them. We're going to call everyone too.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni! Get us some tea, will you?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, Mum.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time. I ain't leaving before we've all had some sweets!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen Asim and Aunt so happy before.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? They're gettin' more than they ever deserved.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Malika, I can't believe you're still saying that!

150
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:42,484
Hey...

151
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:47,624
Still gonna ignore me?

152
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,975
I want to see Aunt.

153
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,057
And me?

154
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:58,926
I mean, who am I to you?

155
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,286
What is it?

156
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:06,193
I just wanted to thank you.

157
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,844
For honouring my love.

158
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,534
I've won your love.

159
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:14,656
You haven't won my love.

160
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,806
You've just had your way.

161
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:19,218
Out of my way.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe you're still in touch with Zoha.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just came across her today.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have come with her.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think she's done anything to me that I should've refused... In fact, if you ask me, I don't think she's done anything to you...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? She left me, left this place! What hasn't she done to me?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but I never saw you sad that she left you...!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not the type who'd show their wounds to the world.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish you'd shown her this wound. Perhaps she would've realised you needed her.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was the lady of the house. My wife! I didn't have to tell her I needed her!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be serious!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember when you'd brought someone here the day after she left you? I tried talking to you about it but you pulled me up and asked me to stay out of your personal life...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should let me stay out...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody would've come here if she hadn't left me.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she would never have left if you'd given her her proper place.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not gonna take you siding with her before me.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Granny...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's worried for no reason! She's still got her doubts!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I be happy if she's not happy for me?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think Salma's right, Asim.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika giving in so suddenly... Aqil fixing the date... Don't you think something's off?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're very upright, Granny... They're worried about the thing with Malika's pictures, the rumours... So they fixed the date quick. It's okay.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Salma told me Malika didn't even talk to you.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've come with us. Believe me, they were all so happy!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Malika. I'm not talking about anyone else.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd Malika agree if she were not happy with it?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, get these doubts out. And explain it to Mum.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pray we're mistaken.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure that's it. I know her.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello! How you doin'?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Sup? Where's the others?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Busy with the assignments... And Farooq's Dad isn't well. So, just the two of us!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should go and check on his Dad.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, right.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, I wanted to talk about something.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't mind it.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would I?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been ages since I saw you so relaxed!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had a lot going on...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's over now...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now I'm so relaxed...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously. Good to have you back, mate.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And mate... I'm sorry too...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always thought you're turning me against Malika.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate, let's not talk about her.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember you always said she's ambitious? Overambitious, in fact!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just uses people as stepping stones to get what she wants!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she care about a loser like me?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I said, let's not talk about her!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There you go again!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, I'm fine.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, now that you've seen everything... There's something else you should know.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wasn't mistaken one bit about her.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asif saw Malika at the restaurant, and, Jaysus, her squeeze was no ordinary man.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't he tell me?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We thought we would, but Asif thought we shouldn't.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told me.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You loved her. It would've hurt you.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, man. You should've told me!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The love for her in your eyes, I mean...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's play.

227
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,981
Mum's got some real lovely dresses for you! Come and see! I'm sure you'll love the designs!

228
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,191
Not interested.

229
00:18:39,191 --> 00:18:50,094
Mum and Aqil are also getting your jewellery. Mum really wants you to queen up! I asked them to get a maroon and golden gown! I'm sure it'd look lovely!

230
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,794
Jesus Christ, Munni, bugger off!

231
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:56,275
I thought you'd like it golden and maroon!

232
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:59,157
Get me a ruddy coffin!

233
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:01,628
Please don't say that.

234
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:09,789
What do you want to hear? Bury me in a coffin proper than bury me alive in a gown and jewels! Save your money!

235
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,655
But you were so happy about it!

236
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:20,255
Bug out! I'm sure you've got loads to do besides getting on my wick!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I took it a bit too seriously...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say sorry. I should say sorry.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot that every girl's gotta ask her life partner before doing anything here.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should've asked you.

243
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,480
Please don't embarrass me anymore! It's okay!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what Aunt would think!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you worried about what I think?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay then.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I gotta be conscious around my life partner, because folks really get triggered these days!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You? Conscious around me? I can't even imagine that!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you just say anything you come up with!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?
-Yeah.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't even that careless.
-Oh?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How careless are you, then?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stick with me and you'll find out!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna tell your friend Aqil that you had a row with me.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, go on. What's the worst he can do?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned to find out!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see Asim's been going back early these days.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope Aunt's fine...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate... She's really nice.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she is. She's very happy, of late.

265
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,080
What do you mean?

266
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,771
Sana... Don't think so much about Asim, okay? Because he's out of your life.

267
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:28,851
When was he ever in my life?

268
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:31,771
I just wonder why he goes back early these days.

269
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:35,194
Okay... So you want to hear it...

270
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:38,322
Alright then...

271
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:41,861
He's getting married.

272
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:48,831
I had no idea. Mr Sohail told me.

273
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:52,885
But you know you always get to hear these things...

274
00:21:53,852 --> 00:21:56,271
No... It's good.

275
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,631
I'll wish him.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at these lovely earrings! Malika would look stunning with these!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show these to her and let me know if there's something she doesn't like. I'll be busy tomorrow.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her here, Munni. Why's she in there?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She isn't happy about it, Mum...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's leaving her home, all of us. Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If there's anything else on her mind, get it out of her.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be angry now, Aqil. She's just here for a few more days.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni... What'd she say?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't really get her... I showed her everything, but she just wasn't interested.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put these in order. I'll show it to her.

292
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,714
I hope you're not busy.

293
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,058
No?

294
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,851
Farah told me about your marriage.

295
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,912
Congratulations.

296
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:03,192
Thank you. Thank you so much.

297
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:08,099
There's some things you can share with your colleagues.

298
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:13,722
Well, Miss Sana...

299
00:24:13,722 --> 00:24:23,413
I was about to tell you. In fact, I even told Mum she can ask you for help if she needs anything.

300
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:27,403
My pleasure. Let me know if I can help.

301
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,594
Thank you so much, Sana.

302
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,344
Once again, congratulations.

303
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:36,289
Sana...
-Yeah?

304
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:41,129
Malika's my Aunt's daughter...

305
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:44,899
And my love.

306
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,849
Good for you!

307
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:12,213
Come here, Malika. Look what we've got for you! I'm sure you'll love everything!

308
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:17,240
My, I wonder what it could be!

309
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,887
Blimey, that's what you're crowing about!

310
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,668
Have some shame!

311
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:27,198
Just for the sake of our happiness?

312
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:31,740
Jeez, I'm about to crucify myself for your happiness. What else do you want?

313
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,161
Get her out of my sights, Munni. I don't want to see her face.

314
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:38,041
Not fair.

315
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,571
But remember.

316
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,214
You'll regret it.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pack it all, Munni.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could she possibly be any more thankless?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some of the neighbours asked when the dholak's gonna be.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Invite them to the dholak and the mehndi. Tell them the dholak's this evening.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pack everything.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd I keep it?

324
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,427
It's Malika...

325
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:59,627
I'm in trouble, Atif.

326
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,132
What kind of trouble?

327
00:27:01,132 --> 00:27:04,456
My family's busted me!

328
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:09,530
Don't worry. You can always come to me.

329
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,631
They're getting me married off!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing with my phone?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calling a friend.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Inviting her, of course.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you hang up?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was done.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her again, will you? I'll talk to her.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she can't be here.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to me.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her it's your mother's number. She better not start calling me.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you didn't invite me to your sister's mehndi!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know why I didn't.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've loved to meet your Mum, your sisters.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, sure...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that we could've never met again.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be serious.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know how good you are.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My sister and Mum don't.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll just see an old woman controlling a young man.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does love care about these things? Age and all...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, but...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and my sister won't get it.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our society doesn't.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if your family never got it?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry... I'll talk to them.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, keep me waiting...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Zoha... I'd rather leave than hear that.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think it's time we sorted a few things out, Aqil.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like -- moving in together. Getting married.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you okay?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was here because I may not be able to see you for a few days.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, blimey, you're so worried and making sure it catches on!

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always tried to ease you.
-Okay...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, but...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you when it's time.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon now.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mate...

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Smile. We're celebrating! My sister's getting married! Don't be all serious-like!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good girl.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now would you please get me some tea?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

375
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:51,039
Malika! Come with me! It's so fun!

376
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,778
Don't even start, Munni... Go away.

377
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:59,640
Everyone's singing, dancing, celebrating. They're waiting for you! Why are you still here?

378
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,811
I don't like your blasted singin' or your chuffin' dance one bit!

379
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:10,093
Why do you want to pick a fight before you leave? Can't you just be happy... For us?

380
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:16,873
Who cares about me here? Why should I be happy for any of you?

381
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:21,703
Why'd you accept the proposal if you're not happy with it?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is for my girl.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're too kind, Salma...

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahida... I'm her aunt, after all!

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else would get her a gown for her mehndi?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're both just lovely, Aunt!

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika, by the way?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was here just now! I think she went out.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you give it to her?

390
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,039
She -- Had a -- headache, Mum...

391
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:01,210
She took a pill and went to sleep.

392
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,103
How'd she fall asleep in this noise?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, let's give it to her.

394
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:09,322
Hello, Aunt...

395
00:32:09,322 --> 00:32:11,672
Well, hello there...

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at this lovely mayoun gown! From your aunt!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord give her good fortune. I thought I'd give her these and bless her.

398
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:31,419
Munni told me you had a headache. You could've told me. I would've made you some tea.

399
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:35,284
Tea ain't gonna cure this headache.

400
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:37,249
Take a pill.

401
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,920
I'll do with your blessings for a start...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say you should get some rest. I'll get going, Zahida...

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, Aunt.
-Bye, my dear.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A little more?
-No, thanks.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told us. Noriyan would've brought you here himself.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. What if you got sick on the way?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine now. Don't worry.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have come alone.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Sakina, but I thought I'd come here, get myself checked up. I've heard a lot about this doctor.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Uncle... Ain't never a good idea to ignore your health.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell your Mum. She looks so weak...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's got blood pressure and stuff these days. Anyway...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let you go so quickly! You've got to stay here for a few days!

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a few days?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay here as long as you want!

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you put Mum's complaints to rest, Uncle? You're staying here at least a week.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're family. I want to stay here, too. But you know about your Aunt and the kids...

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all alone. Things ain't really good at the village. Robberies and all.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord protect us all...
-No excuses, Uncle. Please.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you stay with us? Remember how much I asked you?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only Mum weren't here alone!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say it's the same with me...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, check this out.
-Aye, I almost forgot.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leavin' already?
-Yeah, in a bit of a hurry.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wanted to tell you Malika's getting married tomorrow.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you fix the date so suddenly? All good?
-Yeah, it's her in-laws. Blimey... Just had to do it.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You coming?
-Of course.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with Aunt.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell her, but...

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't guarantee she'll come.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's back. Why don't you invite her yourself?
-Hello, Aunt. How are you?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, I was just here to invite you.
-To?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His sister's getting married.
-Oh.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to your family.
-Sorry but I haven't got a card. Everything happened so quickly we couldn't even get the cards ready.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay. Waqas'll be there even if I couldn't.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll get going.
-Okay. Take care.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me a glass of water, Nasrin.
-Mum...

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you say I'd be there if you couldn't?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you going?

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course I am, but I wanted to go with you.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't like your friend one bit.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So please don't insist.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's his sister's wedding. Please.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Waqas.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!
-Hey!

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, how are you?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm good.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going back?

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, just droppin' by to invite Waqas. My sister's getting married.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's really exciting! I love weddings!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do? So... Would you like to come over to my place?

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
