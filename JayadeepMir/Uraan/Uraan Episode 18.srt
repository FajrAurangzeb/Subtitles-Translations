1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Lord...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what forced me to do this.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've been chained to that Asim forever if I didn't...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're safe here.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've put everything on the line. Because I trust you.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you regret it?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't regret it one bit. But please...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never let me regret my decision...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope no one saw you coming here?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody knows I'm here.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. Very good.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with this mehndi... This gown?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to... I could never break free if I didn't...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Asim!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even imagine living with him!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And me?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dream of it...

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's what gave me the courage to do it...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're worried, if the guest room feels suffocating to you... Feel free to come to my room.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After we get married, sure. I'll live out my dream life with you.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes... Of course... We'll get married.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep Malika safe, O Lord...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Malika, what've you done?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I would've called the cops on you if I didn't care about my honour!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep your voice down.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep at it and I can call the cops on you too. For bulldozing me.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll effin' kill you!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold it!
-Don't you dare touch me! Get it?
-Aqil!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take that bloodthirst somewhere else.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll break every bone in your body if you so much as touched her here!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought I'd live to see this day!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Were it not for my honour, I would've choked you right here!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You choked me the day you shut all happiness out of my life!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- Asim! Ych a fi! I'd rather be buried alive!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wait until we get home! You may just get your wish!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Home? It's a blimmin' crypt where I've buried all my dreams!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine by me. I'm calling the cops.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you gonna tell them, eh? What've I done?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm grown-up now! I can do as I chuffin' want!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You still wanna call the cops? Be my guest! They'd love to feel your collar for forcing me!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just stop it!

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see... So it was all planned...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You pick out the big fish, send your daughters to them in the middle of the night, and come knocking when you know you have him! Shame on you!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut your gob! You come on to innocent girls and have the nerve to accuse us!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't call her here.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She came here because she wanted to!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just let her in so I can take her back first thing in the morning and save you from this humiliation. But you! You accuse me!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you talking about, Atif? I -- I'm here to get married -- to you!

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind? You better know your place!

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't call her here. There's nothing of the sort going on. She's all yours.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get a move on, already! Before they kick you out!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare even talk to Malika again.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God, it was so fun! I can't tell you!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Aqil's family! They're really nice. I had proper fun. They were so warm...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. You're my cousin, and Aqil's my best friend.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... All thanks to you!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of course...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas... They're really nice. Genuinely nice.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have stayed there so long.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I left when you called me.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if I didn't call you?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you shouldn't have gone there.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's your best friend, he invited me, I promised him, I went... What's the big deal?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go to the wedding together. Then again, I guess you'd rather go alone?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Waqas? I can go where I want, right?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do we always have to contradict each other?
-You're starting it, Waqas.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your friend invited me, and I accepted it. Big deal!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you don't care what I think?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why you're imposing your views on me, Waqas.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think I've got the right to do as I want to? Like anyone else?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you actually don't care about what I think...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no big deal, Waqas. You're just blowing it out of proportion for no reason.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He invited me, I accepted. It's as simple as that. Please be mature. There's nothing wrong with it.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you wish.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqas!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

87
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:57,305
I'm sorry to say this but I can't have you around anymore.

88
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,275
Work something out.

89
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,384
Okay.

90
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:14,544
Thank you for putting up with Noriyan and me for so long.

91
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:19,438
You've chosen it for yourself...

92
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:27,918
It is something I never wanted...

93
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:32,329
I still remember my time with your parents...

94
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:34,799
But...

95
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:43,229
If it's between living here and my principles... You know what I'd choose...

96
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,527
You shouldn't have called Malika's mother and brother here.

97
00:09:54,527 --> 00:10:04,407
Sometimes, it's better to dare, even if you make a big mistake. At least I can look myself in the mirror.

98
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,039
Okay.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pack your things.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did yesterday.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Noriyan back?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He called. He's on the way.

103
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:38,222
What'd you tell him?

104
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,372
Nothing.

105
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:44,732
I won't tell him what you're talking about.

106
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:51,295
I didn't bring her here.

107
00:10:52,308 --> 00:11:04,782
If you'd brought her here, I would've thought you wanted her here, wanted her in your life.

108
00:11:04,782 --> 00:11:06,798
But...

109
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:17,307
Someone who could run away in the middle of the night in her wedding gown can never be the pride of a family.

110
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:28,343
You'll need some money...

111
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,191
I won't.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You pick out the big fish, send your daughters to them in the middle of the night, and come knocking when you know you have him! Shame on you!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't call her here.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She came here because she wanted to!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just let her in so I can take her back first thing in the morning and save you from this humiliation. But you! You accuse me!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you talking about, Atif? I -- I'm here to get married -- to you!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind? You better know your place!

118
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:41,467
Would you like to have something?

119
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:44,564
You don't feed the dead before burying them.

120
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:49,745
You deck them up. Just get to it.

121
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:52,495
Please stop saying that...

122
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:59,188
Munni! Tell her to get ready. Aqil says she's not going to the parlour.

123
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:04,304
So it's almost time! When's my funeral?

124
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,724
I hope everyone's invited.

125
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,915
Munni, tell her she better leave this place quietly.

126
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,914
I'm never going to forgive you for this.
-Oh, really!

127
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:21,614
You brought it on yourself. Kicked out by two men you trusted!

128
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:26,655
We still want to save your skin.

129
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,766
Leave it, Mum. I'll deck her up.

130
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:35,768
You've done what you wanted here.

131
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:44,898
But please... Treat them with respect. They're not just your Aunt's family now... They're your in-laws.

132
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:49,229
A mother will always forgive you.

133
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:56,738
You won't have it this easy with them.

134
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,560
What do you think? I'd run away again?

135
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:07,728
You've fallen into sin. If you found redemption bitter, I dare not imagine what'd happen to you!

136
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,441
Mothers always pray that their daughters only come back for their funeral.

137
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:24,212
I pray that you don't come back here even for your funeral.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coming to pick me up?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are we going?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where you didn't want me to go alone?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How sad...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't see how much I love you, how much I care for you...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. That's actually very sad.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because your love always takes a back seat.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you still upset? Still cross?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you care?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course I do! That's why I called you.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to go there.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's your best friend. His sister's getting married. Won't he mind?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wouldn't care.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should go there, Waqas. Because I'm going.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you wish. Bye.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was it?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me you had another domestic.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told her I'm not going to the wedding, but she wants to.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Not in the mood.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because Novera's going?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't care about me. She could've just said, 'I'm not going without you'.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you always want her to say what you want?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want her to stay away from Aqil too.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no problem if she's going with you.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now. Get up, get ready. Or Aqil will say he's afraid he may have to give something.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't. As if I haven't given him enough!

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you -- What've you given him?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always a problem!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, Mum, what happened?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing. I always said we'd have to leave someday. It's time now...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why? And why so suddenly?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had my eyes on a place. Now that Aunt Navida's tenant has left...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's real good. I don't think we're going to get another chance like this. Prime spot, fair price. Obvious choice.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you talk to Atif?
-Yeah, I've talked to him. He has no problem.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go talk to him.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay here if you like... I'm going.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something happened? Between you and Atif?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... Let's just say something happened.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you said something to him!
-So be it!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't disgrace myself anymore by living here.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I leave home for a night and you pick a fight with Atif! Blimey...

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't start it. I ended it. Forever.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can live the way he wants.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe... Just a little longer?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can leave once I've got a job.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, you'll get a job there. God will bless you just the same.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've packed your things. Check if I missed anything.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just thinking about the new house... All the expenses... I can teach the kids... But how are we going to get by until I've started?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll get by.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Navida's talked about me at the factory where she works.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum...
-My dear...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Would you like it if your wife came here?</i>

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wife? What are you talking about?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan... Never forget that everything I'm doing is for the better. For you.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Mum...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless her...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's getting late, Zahida... I think we should finish with the rituals.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like you're more eager to take her home than Asim!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. We've all been waiting...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... Munni, get some milk for the ritual.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
-Let's go.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello Atif.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ready?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you need anything, feel free to ask me. Just like old times?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been kind to us, Atif... No idea why Mum decided to leave...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure she's thought of something.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know Mum's decision has hurt you.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you know her...

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't budge at all.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't she tell you why?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She did, and --
-You know I don't like anyone poking his nose in my personal matters.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor do I, Atif...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not about you... It's my fault...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum thinks I'd always depend on you if we stayed here.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's your Mum...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows what's best for you.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're her son.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I'm just a call away if you need anything, okay? Take care.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
-Bye.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, we're coming.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The car's here, Akmal. Help us get these in.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think I'd mind what she'd say?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because she came here all worked up!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you that?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I'm surprised, to say the least, to see how she left her place... Didn't take her brother's blessings, didn't see anyone - not even her sister!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's what Mum's worried about!
-It is worrying.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think no one else would've noticed?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's their concern. Probably something between the siblings... It'll be okay.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I'm saying is... Don't mind what she says. If she says anything... You know, bad... Just take it quietly, okay?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum wasn't feeling well, so I had to...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a look...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much did it cost?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... It looks expensive...

249
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:17,879
The least I could do for you...

250
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:21,709
The most you can do, more like...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you happy?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you still need to ask?

253
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,731
You wanted to get me. You got me. Congratulations.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you care about my happiness? What I want?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that, Malika...

256
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:42,004
Your happiness means the world to me.

257
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:47,166
I wouldn't be here if it did.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes? What is it?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't we gonna bring Malika breakfast?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she'd be waiting for us!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Mum... I'm sure she'll be delighted to see us.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm her mother. I know exactly what'd delight her.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Aunt think? And Asim?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They saw everything as they left...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They had a pretty good idea that Malika wants nothing to do with us.

267
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,922
Words, no matter how bitter, can never sever ties, as long as we've got a place for each other in our hearts.

268
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:01,443
Except we've got no place in hers.

269
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:04,264
But she's got in ours.

270
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:06,324
Please, Mum?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better don't say anything to Aqil. He said he won't even attend the reception!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea when he's gonna get up! And as for the reception, we're giving everyone a reason to point their fingers at us!

274
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,729
If you can hug Malika before everyone, I'm sure you can attend the reception.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Make an omelette. I need to go get some things before we leave.
-Okay.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you do something for me?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... You've got a legal licence to have everything your way. What is it?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say anything to Mum that'd make her think you're not happy with me.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Scared she'll pull you up, ask you why you married me at all?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not that...

282
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,559
Mum loves you so much... I don't want her to be hurt by anything you say.

283
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,295
How much did it hurt to know you're robbing me of my happiness?

284
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:39,536
Mum didn't rob you of your happiness --
-I'm not talking about Mum.

285
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:42,335
Hello, Mum...
-Hello. Bless you.

286
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:48,386
We're almost ready.
-C'mon. Zahida's brought some fine breakfast. Quickly!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're cross with your Mum... But she's brought breakfast for you.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps there's nothing like a mother's love...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No mother can ever be cross with her child.

291
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:18,117
She's doing it for me?

292
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:20,631
Don't tell me she's doing it for me.

293
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:23,827
She's never done it for me before.

294
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:28,847
I know I'm like her son, but...

295
00:29:28,847 --> 00:29:32,567
It's your day, ma'am...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll be waiting.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.
-Hello.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?
-Great. Bless you.

301
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:56,198
Would you look at what your Aunt's got!
-Yeah! Seems like we're in for a real treat.

302
00:29:56,198 --> 00:30:02,298
You didn't have to, Aunt...
-The pleasure is all ours, Asim.

303
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:07,197
Here. I've got this halwa for you.

304
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:10,570
You didn't really have to show off, you know...

305
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:20,540
We're not showing off. It's a custom.

306
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:28,789
Strange, innit? I thought you didn't even want to see me at my funeral.

307
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:31,389
You could've just donated it to us.

308
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:37,458
I -- I think I should get going...

309
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:45,900
Aqil wasn't up -- I'm not sure if I've locked the door... Munni!
-No way. You've got to have tea.

310
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,712
See you at the reception.
-Please, Aunt...

311
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:57,089
See you in the evening. C'mon, Munni.
-Okay.

312
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,620
Bye.
-Bye, love.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I knew Malika would upset them so much, we could've gone over to their place for breakfast.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've loved to... She's my sister. Whatever's going on?

315
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,265
You're up?

316
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:33,489
Let's just say your love for Malika opened my eyes...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you go there when I said she's no one to us?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forced her to come.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Munni said we ought to go. I thought we'd better. Just as a formality, at least?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and get breakfast for him.
-Okay.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see her?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless her. She's very happy.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope they had no complaints about the wedding.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried the best I could, but still...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all... You've spent so much... How are you going to pay it back?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless the Lord, Mum. Your son's not in hock.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you get the money, then?
-Munni!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly, now! I'm getting late!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to you later. Have to dash.
-But...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you're coming with us to the reception?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want to see her face! And you want me to attend her reception? For Christ's sake, Mum -- How could you even think?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you want to do these formalities, be my guest. Just keep me out of it!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd call and ask if Monsieur's fixed his mood, but thought I'd rather drop by.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to ask.
-That's why I'm here.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You get angry for nothing. Like a kid.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum says you should be thankful if you've got someone who's angry with you.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't you think you should be all the more thankful if you've got someone ready to make it up to you?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't that what you do? When you've made a mistake? Because it's your mistake?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what've I done that you're so angry about?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should've been angry with you, because you left me alone. I had to go there alone! Without you!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you have to go at all?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm not like you, okay?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be sorry you couldn't attend the wedding of your best friend's sister, but you're angry because I went there?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I be sorry?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil doesn't give two hoots if I attend his sister's wedding or not.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, they'd be glad I didn't show up. I know what it's like. If I drop by, they get worried where they could have me sit!

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... He was never sorry living on my money!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that about your best friend.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's <i>my</i> best friend. I know him inside out.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't even bother to ask me why I wasn't there! He never forgot to come to me when he needed help!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's oh-so-lovely of him!

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You positively hate everything about him! How is he your best friend then?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you can call him your best friend. He's been to your place. You've talked to him about me. How could he be your friend if you loathe him so much?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never said one bad word about you. He speaks quite highly of you.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It pains me to see how you want to show off that you've helped him arrange his sister's wedding.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's true...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking at my future. Would you have me account for everything after our marriage, too?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you won't even listen to me after our marriage?

365
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:51,376
So it's just the wife's duty to obey orders, while the husband can order her around as he likes, pull her up when he wants? Is that what you're telling me?

366
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:54,117
That's how it is here.

367
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,077
I got you! See!

368
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,560
Don't take it seriously, I'll be a good, understanding husband.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. I'm sure.

371
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,631
Let's go have something. I get this peckish feeling when I'm angry.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thanks. I don't feel like eating anything right now.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

374
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:25,291
You're angry. Cheeks -- Going red -- You -- You're getting angry now!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, let's go.

376
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:34,856
You created quite a situation, though...

377
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:40,377
I'm not afraid of any 'situation'. I trust the One who can help us out.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way you're working now, Mum.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've talked about tuitions. I should be able to start in a few days.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Focus on your studies.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a good job at the factory. No issues there.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum --
-We need a long-term solution, Noriyan. Focus on your studies for now.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look for a job later.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'd get one anytime...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It takes years, if not months, to find a good job.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure the Lord will help you.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to start doing something before Ashi comes here.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashi?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus -- You're still thinking of her?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who should I think of?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Certainly not the one even you've got no reason to think of now!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to get married, Mum. I'm not thinking of anyone!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way... When I'm not around. But while I'm hanging back, let me tell you - Ashi's the one for you.

394
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,837
But why, Mum?

395
00:37:58,197 --> 00:38:00,547
Because I've got only one son, Noriyan,

396
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:05,487
And I can't see him become a hermit because of some snooty Malika.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
