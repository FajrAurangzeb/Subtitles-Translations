1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You stopped Malika from going to university?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I don't trust her anymore.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's very upset.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's upset that her Aunt's coming.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think she'd give in if you forced her?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been engaged to him for years. I've just got to convince her for the marriage.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think she'd give in.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wake Her Majesty up. Tell her breakfast's ready.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm taking it to her room. I don't think she's coming out today.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Keep it there even if she refuses.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that she knows we don't care if she refuses anything. Anything, get it?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your breakfast.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No thanks. Take it back.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? I said something.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum told me to keep it here even if you refused.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants me to know she doesn't care, right?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're upset because Aunt's coming, right?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I'm upset because Mum's invited her!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been engaged. You'll get married to him soon.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Engaged? I don't accept it!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone else does.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And who do you think could be better than Asim?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've I done to deserve someone like Asim?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say that. It angers the Lord.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea why Dad named me Malika [Empress]!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For all that barbarism, I'm sure he would've named you Anne Bonny!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ha ha ha, get this vaudeville outta here, or you're getting a proper pasting!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika, my dear... Please get this hatred for Asim out of you.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves you so much. He'll take care of you!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gordon Bennett! You know everything!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're quite the diviner! Go and ask Mum to put up a board outside. 'Zahida the Augurer'! 'We tell girls in the mire their destiny'!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me be very clear - my dreams begin where Asim's end!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you realise you're driving a wedge between Mum and Aunt?
-So I should take the fall! You can't be serious!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd you marry if not Asim?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure there's someone the Lord would've destined for me...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but you're not ready to marry him.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut your gob! Take this breakfast and get out!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you hear me? Take it back!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Growing insolent every day!

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was thinking...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to Dubai for work.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about me? If you're not here...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let me finish.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think it'll be fabulous if you came with me.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll do you good to go somewhere for a change.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't want to stand in your way.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know it hurts me when you say that.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to tour the world with you.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dubai's just the beginning.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we aren't really... You know...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't go out together until we take things forward.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the only one stopping things from going forward.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just leave it, will you?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know what's the best time for me?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I'm with you.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like right now.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm having my best time.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How smooth...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, at least say yes to this...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes? What is it?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the bike. Use it.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My family asks me so many things if I do.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got two sisters who haven't been married yet.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I worry more for them than roaming around on a bike.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a lot of responsibility.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we're together... I'm sure we can solve any problems that come up.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust God.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leave your bike here if your family asks about it.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep the keys. Use it when you like.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure you're not coming to Dubai? Oh, I was just kidding.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't mind my asking, but you said Malika doesn't want to get married a few days back. How'd you convince her so quickly?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil thought she should get married. She can continue studying from over there.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why? Didn't you always oppose him?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you're not well.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please. Don't let emotions make you take a decision which could cost Asim and Malika later.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want Malika to be your daughter-in-law?
-What are you saying?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I was so delighted at the engagement! More importantly, you know how much my son loves her! Despite all her bitterness and spite!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, what's your problem?
-Aunt...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We need to talk.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go in!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're talking about something important.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my future you're deciding. I have a right to speak!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes? Go on.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum thinks I'll run off with someone if I went to university.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they don't know that one could run off on the day of the wedding.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind your tongue!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I want to say is... If you tried to force me, you better be prepared to never see my face again!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish He'd never given me someone like her...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. You won't have to do anything of the sort because of Asim.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's up to you.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt! What a pleasant surprise!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello! How are you?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with her?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing. Just a bit worried about Malika.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told her not to worry about anything.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything will be taken care of. Just fix the date.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're not ready for the marriage just yet.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're not fixing the date until she's done with her studies.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you said it yourself, Aunt...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It occurred to me it'd disturb Malika if we got about with the wedding and all...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you would've thought about it...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum... Ask Munni to get me some black coffee.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll go change. Take care.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you tell Aqil?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather keep it between us.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's a man... Malika's brother. He wouldn't be able to take it if he heard what she said.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It can't be hidden for long...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord guide her... I won't tell Asim how much the love of his life despises him either.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... Let destiny unfold...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright? You look worried.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm good. Everything's okay.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. All good.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the only girl I ever gave my visiting card.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you ask me who I am?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's you!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but I didn't save your number.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wasn't expecting that.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to meet you.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you thought about it long enough?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't get such a chance twice.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People long to get a chance all their lives...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it.
-That's why I want to meet you.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can also pick you up if you want.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll let you know.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your luck's in but it may be out any moment.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how'd he get my number?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, what do I care?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told them we're in no hurry.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika can finish her education.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was she at home?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's said she can only go to university after her marriage.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, the twit...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, the most unexpected people can be the most wise.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's happened?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like they'd tell us.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember - nobody would tell what's up with their daughters.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do I feel there's something you're not telling me?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You deserve better, Asim.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did she refuse?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ask as if you hope she won't.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you had no trouble finding your way.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Aunt. I used the map.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've asked Waqas to pick you up.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't want to disturb him.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he would've loved to.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right, Aunt, but I don't like to depend on someone so much.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. I get it...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we're here for you. Let us know if you need anything.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, that's really sweet of you.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've brought Faizan along.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left for work. He had a meeting.
-Oh...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a surprise! How are you?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very well. How are you?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great. Never been better! You look nice.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look awesome as well!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you come here?
-On my own.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On you own? You drove all the way?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, what are you so intrigued about?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt was surprised too.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you mentioned the traffic here...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing's impossible.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even said I'll find my way!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've told me.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear that?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just need to ask.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to take this call. I'll be back.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum never talks to me so softly.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you always fishing for sympathies?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know she loves you so much.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you love me too... A bit?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bli --

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, is it --

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait a minute.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, buddy, what's up?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was coming over. I thought I'd check.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm home, but busy.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got guests.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you kidding?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say Novera's there.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, see you at the gym in the evening.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
-Bye.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry. One of the lads.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you say no? I was about to leave.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, you're not allowed to go. Not just yet.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Mum would rather you have lunch...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Absolutely. No one's going out. I've prepared your favourite Thai dish.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Aunt.
-We're having lunch together, okay?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just perfect!
-Thank you, very sweet of you!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you going?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming in a minute!
-Okay.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talked to Mr Atif...

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says I should be thinking about your marriage.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif said that?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just meant -- What's Atif got to do with my marriage?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's divorced his own wife, set himself free... And worrying about my marriage!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with him? I'll talk to him.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare!

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare say a word to Mr Atif!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got no right to talk about his personal life.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Atif cares about my marriage so much, he should give me a room here.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't keep my wife in this servant's quarters in the basement, after all!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If your Mum can live here, why can't your wife?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not everyone settles for small things like you...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Noriyan, life would be too difficult with anyone who doesn't.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's very nice, Mum.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you met her, you'd realise she's all I need to light up my life.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Mr Atif was right!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you like your Uncle's daughters?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle's daughters?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum, I like someone else!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about her?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't live without me.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A fellow student?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to take you to her.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell me you're coming.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once I'm back from the village, okay.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Mum!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, though...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Atif's a bit strange.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he cares so much about my marriage, why did he send his wife away?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can be whatever you want...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you'll have to do just as I say.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'm here, Atif.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can take you to heights you've never even dreamt of.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Magazine covers, fashion shoots, films, dramas - you name it. You'll have it.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you live alone in this mansion?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Not counting the maid who lives here, yeah.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's a servant.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She lives on my money.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got a son, too...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm supporting him too.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no right to say anything about Mr Atif's life.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Better stay quiet.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn off the pool filter, get it covered. Do something about the mover or there will be flooding. And keep the bags in the car. Not this --
-Okay.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening.
-Good evening.
-Blimey, Zahir!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No call, no text...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's back from London. I was busy with her.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh... I totally forgot! Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else do I have to tell you? And for how long?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Angry with me?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would I be?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even bother to call and ask me where I am or how I'm doing, or what I've been up to... For three days!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what I'm like... Forgetful, messy...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You weren't this way. But you're staying this way.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't be saying that. Come.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go see Aunt.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's not home. She's gone for lunch with friends.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's why you're here. Okay.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here to tell you I'll be joining you in Dubai two days later.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you were so excited about the Dubai distribution!
-I know. I was excited, wanted to come and all...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But something's come up.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I've talked to the folks over there, they'll take care of everything without me.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of everything else when I get there.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look after yourself, I'm off. Bye.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- Hey -- Zahir -- Za --!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with him?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least ask Mum!
-She ain't even talking to me!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think she'd talk to you if you had your way like this?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to go, Munni.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, have your breakfast.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, I'm late!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's ready!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll miss the bus!
-Let her go.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she missed her 'bus', we'll regret it the rest of our lives.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to go, Mum.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you everything when I'm back.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I get breakfast, Mum?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello!

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, I'll drop you.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need any favours from anyone.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no favour, Malika. I want to talk about something.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to tell you something.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've already told Aunt all I have to say about it.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just honoured my love...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum always thought you hated me and you proved her right.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe it if you still can't.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you better not stand in my way like that again.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Asim!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The boss is calling you.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ayesha, please email these.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I come in, sir?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanted to talk about something?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes sir. I heard there are a few openings in marketing. I wanted to talk about that.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. A few people left the job... Know someone you can recommend?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir. My cousin. He's done a BA.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's got some experience?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, sir. He doesn't have any experience.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure he'll do well. He works really hard.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He isn't really qualified for this job... But I trust your judgement.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring him tomorrow. I'd like to meet him.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, sir. I'm on it.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. You may go.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's his problem?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Asim?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, were you sleeping?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call to ask that?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I called to tell you that I've talked to my boss.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's called you for an interview tomorrow.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Interview?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Tomorrow. And I'm 100% sure you'll get this job.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, if you're so sure... I'll be there.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Good. See you tomorrow.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, wow... What a surprise!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.
-Good morning.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you get my pictures?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I could get your number... Getting your pictures is no big deal.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take me wrong.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my job.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Telling people who have no idea their true worth.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, believe me, you're worth it.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, take a seat.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea or coffee?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thanks, I'll be leaving quickly. I've got to go back.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you've barely come here and you're in a hurry to leave?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two cups of coffee. Quick.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please shut it down, will you?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way... I like your personality.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you want to meet me?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... As pretty and proud as your name...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's a good one!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm serious.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew the moment I saw your pictures that the camera will fall in love with you.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could be the next superstar in modelling or TV.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Why so nervous?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't get into what you're talking about.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one photoshoot.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all it takes to change your fate.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be allowed to.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you need to ask?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Family or someone else?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you're so lovely... You must have a boyfriend.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or a lover whose happiness means the world to you.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, right.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he can't help you live out the kinds of dreams I can.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's right, but...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want this to drive a wedge between us.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if I promised that nothing of the sort will ever happen?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it here.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You happened to come when I was looking for a fresh face.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For an international brand.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine the exposure...

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine, that's your first chance.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just like a dream come true for you.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it doesn't suit you, you may leave...

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really surprised, though...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you come here in the first place if you had all these problems, didn't want to do it?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone so lovely and beautiful as you...

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't possibly miss this chance!

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thousands dream of this.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the one who gets to live the dream.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm worried about my family.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They won't allow me.
-Don't worry about that.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one will hear. Trust me.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's an international shoot. It isn't even for the local market.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --
-Just a minute.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your advance.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think carefully.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you said no, I'm cancelling the cheque, and if you said yes, you're getting double this amount at the end of the shoot.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about it

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And let me know.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika ain't here!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was yous twos yesterday... Just her today...

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up, mate?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea about today. She did text she's busy.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yesterday?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you two?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No secrets from friends!

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear it wasn't planned!

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're suckin' diesel!

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, did you say it?

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously, they wouldn't have just stared at each other.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So did you tell her your secret?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you?
-So?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell her?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't talk about it.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Worried she'd leave you if she found out?

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves me, she can't just leave me!
-Go and tell her, then.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem?
-Jeez! Be done with it!

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him to watch what he's saying!
-You can't watch what you're doing!

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem? If you said anything of the sort again, I'll forget you're my friend!

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hammer some sense into him!

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at him! So much for friendship!

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We try to talk some sense into him, but he has a problem with it!
-Just don't say anything then! You always mess everything up!

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's our friend!

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got trouble coming his way if he doesn't listen!

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, mate, calm down!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's realised he was wrong to hide his reality from Malika.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give him some time to fix it.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pause and think.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, you're made for this field.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I first saw you --

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can take your call. No problem.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Malika, where are you?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been texting you for ages, why don't you reply?

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I'm busy. I won't be coming today.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wrote so much after that! Why didn't you reply?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I'm busy.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? M --

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who were you explaining yourself to?

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should stay at an arm's length from whoever makes you explain yourself.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
