1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,630
By the way, everyone's talking about you.

2
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,120
Me?

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,835
I'm so lucky!

4
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:32,160
Do the girls talk about me too?

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,323
A few, yes...

6
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:36,351
Not all of them.

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,841
Zoha...

8
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,037
I get so insecure sometimes...

9
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,713
I mean...

10
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:49,463
What'll happen to me if you left me?

11
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:52,880
You think I'd ever leave you?

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,079
But why?

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,999
Why not?

14
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,270
Look at yourself.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,450
You've got no shortage of men...

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:07,634
Besides, the likes of me can only dream about everything you've got.

17
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:14,740
Honestly, even if someone like me worked all day and night, he wouldn't get a fraction of what you've got...

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,789
Perhaps we can talk about marriage when I've... You know...

19
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,880
Why are you so grim again?

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,009
I'm not being grim, Zoha... Just... Realistic...

21
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:33,648
I don't get what you see in -- I mean, you can marry any rich man you want.

22
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:36,290
Yes, I can.

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,295
But there's something about you.

24
00:01:38,295 --> 00:01:41,145
I like being with you.

25
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:44,646
My pocket's empty.
-Empty pockets can be filled.

26
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:49,970
I've asked you to manage the Dubai branch with me.

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:57,850
No. I can't work with you. It's too big a responsibility. Besides, your partner, Zahir... He doesn't like me one bit!

28
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,675
C'mon, Zahir's a sweetheart.

29
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:01,989
D --

30
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,534
Does it hurt your male ego to work with me?

31
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:07,109
Jeez --
-Alright, then.

32
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:12,500
Our marketing and financial division's yours.
-I told you I can't work with you.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,410
People already think it's too odd... The two of us...

34
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:20,230
You want me to work for you so people can say I'm using you?

35
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,599
Jesus, mate...

36
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,485
Well, then --
-I'm leaving.

37
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:26,232
Aqi --

38
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,340
She's the perfect face for my new project.

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,969
But I know her, Atif...

40
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:44,815
She won't be interested.

41
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:48,660
How can you be so sure she won't be interested?

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,070
She may get interested if she heard my offer!

43
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,920
What kind of life do you want with me?

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,320
Obviously, a life of comfort, luxuries, serenity... Love...

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,240
And if you got a life...

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,070
With just love?

47
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,010
No comforts... No luxuries...?

48
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,790
What's up with you?

49
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,653
Why are you scaring me with this nightmare?

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,774
What's up?

51
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,300
What are you worried about?

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,250
Asif and Farhan said you've been very worried of late.

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,545
Had a row with Malika, maybe?

54
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,076
No...

55
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,785
What, then?

56
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,380
Who called you?

57
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,863
Atif.

58
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:40,210
He would've called to ask you how you are.

59
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,430
Why are you lying, mate, it was obviously Malika!

60
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,159
No, it wasn't!

61
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,890
But it was about her. Atif asked for her number.

62
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,374
Why? What'd he do with it?

63
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:57,764
He's got wind of your romance and wants to take things forward!

64
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,100
Am I right?

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,699
Oh, please. I haven't even told Mum about Malika. How would Atif find out?

66
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:06,010
What does he want, then?

67
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,540
The thing is...

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,860
Atif wants to offer Malika a commercial...

69
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,980
Wow! That's brilliant! She'll be an overnight star!

70
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,500
Blimey -- Be done with it already...
-Please ask him to give us a chance, too!

71
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,860
After all, we're quite handsome ourselves... Photogenic, innit?

72
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,980
Of course.

73
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,750
And my last selfie got so many likes!

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm dying of worry and you're laughing it off!

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,060
What do you mean 'laughing it off'? We're damn serious, mate!

76
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,217
I don't get what's with this sad face!

77
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,960
You know Mum doesn't like this field one bit.

78
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,962
Mum had Atif swear she wouldn't let me get into modelling. She hates it!

79
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:57,980
So don't do it. Give us a chance. Or Malika.

80
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,380
If Malika got a chance, there's no chance I'm getting her!

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,257
Hello! Get some sense into him.

82
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:06,824
Hey!

83
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,318
I get it now...

84
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,710
What?

85
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:25,393
He doesn't want Atif to meet Malika because if he gave her a chance, Noriyan's Mum will never accept her as her daughter-in-law.

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,330
No need to go to those stony broke plebs!

87
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,326
Why didn't you stop Mum?

88
00:05:41,326 --> 00:05:44,680
Not all of us are uncouth like you.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,650
You're so lippy!

90
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,210
Have you ever thought about your future?

91
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,706
At this rate, you'd just be leaving one coop for another!

92
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,645
I don't think like you.

93
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,256
Don't dream too big for your means.

94
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,050
Besides, I can't say no to Mum.

95
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,710
Ready?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,384
Yeah.
-Bless you.

97
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,650
No need to give them any hopes, Mum.

98
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,960
I mean, they even look like plebs!

99
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,160
Why? What's wrong with them?

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,454
They're family. Upright. What else do you want?

101
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,894
Families and uprightness don't fulfil dreams.

102
00:06:21,894 --> 00:06:24,174
Keep these dialogues to yourself.

103
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:28,070
And keep your voice down. What if they heard you?

104
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,815
What'd they think of us?

105
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:32,100
Munni,

106
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,491
Bring tea when I call you.

107
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:36,943
Okay.

108
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,534
BrINg tEA wHeN I CaLL yOu.

109
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,700
God knows how you like any of this.

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,110
Go and serve them tea. Like a humble slave.

111
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,500
To the dickens with you...

112
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,907
♪ <i>Why do you have to be a heartbreaker,</i> ♪

113
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:57,610
♪ <i>When I was bein' what you want me to be?</i> ♪

114
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,484
Jesus...

115
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,091
It's her again!

116
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,796
And you won't answer because it hurts your male ego! Innit?

117
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:10,500
'I knOW... iT hURts yOuR MalE eGO'.

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,540
Blimey, I don't even know what male ego is!

119
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,199
I'm starting to get it when you told me.

120
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,480
She prates about 'male ego' all the time... Let her have it, then!

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,870
I can't help it.

122
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,340
Think again.

123
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,079
What if Madame didn't call again?

124
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,743
Listen...

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,616
There's many 'Madames' like her.

126
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,110
Why can't I see your Facebook ID?

127
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,260
I deactivated it.

128
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,044
Why?

129
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,090
Jeez, I have to tell you everything...

130
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,823
Alright...

131
00:07:52,230 --> 00:08:01,816
How will Zoha feel any guilt unless I cut off every way she has to reach me?

132
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,840
Block her, maybe?

133
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,525
Jeez...

134
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,300
You're so kiddish... College-level at best...

135
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,840
Look...

136
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,086
If I blocked her, she'd think I'm cross with her.

137
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:25,360
But when I deactivated my account, she'd realise how much she's hurt me.

138
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,972
Get it?

139
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,119
Oh...

140
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:36,086
Ho ho ho!

141
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:40,240
Where do you get these ideas from?

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,812
No idea...

143
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,720
You can learn a few too...
-Nah, bro...

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,150
I don't even know the A, B, Cs of relationships...

145
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,833
I like listening to your stories.

146
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:53,190
Alright, then, get your bard some coffee.

147
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,936
Okay.

148
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,990
Cappuccino!
-Okay!

149
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,882
Nasrin!

150
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,541
Nasrin!

151
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,191
Nasssriiiiin!

152
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:11,190
What happened? Why are you shouting like that?

153
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,176
Mum, ask Nasrin to get some coffee.

154
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,447
Don't tell me he's still here.

155
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,410
He is.

156
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,790
Blimey... That ne'er-do-well!

157
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,160
He's my friend...

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,158
So?

159
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:27,420
He's useless. God knows if he'll ever do anything!
-Hush! He may hear it!

160
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,867
He's our guest, Mum...
-Not like I'm saying anything wrong!

161
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:33,249
Don't his parents worry about him? He's here all day!

162
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:37,500
He isn't just anywhere. He's with me. Good.

163
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,572
Please ask Nasrin to send a cup of coffee. Thank you!

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,522
She's from a very conservative family, Atif.

165
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,307
She can't even think about it.

166
00:09:56,307 --> 00:10:00,160
Forget about that. Just give me her number.

167
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,980
I haven't even got her number, Atif...

168
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,940
What?

169
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,094
You've got this lovely lady in your class, and you haven't even got her number?

170
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,249
What's your problem, Noriyan?

171
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:34,411
I've told you not to call me when I'm at home!

172
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,670
I called you because it's important.

173
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,870
What is it?

174
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,343
Delete your Facebook account. Right now.

175
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,297
What?

176
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,776
But why?

177
00:10:48,776 --> 00:10:52,510
What happened? Are you in your senses?

178
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,530
Can't you do me this little favour?

179
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,651
What is up with you, Noriyan?

180
00:10:58,651 --> 00:11:03,523
What are you saying? You neve --
-I've never had this trouble before!

181
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,507
What kind of trouble?

182
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,812
Just do as I say, Malika.

183
00:11:09,812 --> 00:11:12,322
Please try to understand.

184
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,260
What's with that smile? What's there in my laptop?

185
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,790
The mad woman. I was checking Zoha's ID.

186
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,636
Guess what...

187
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:48,133
She's filled her entire timeline with depressed, emotional, teary stuff... Told the world she's sad.

188
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,016
Look...

189
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:53,595
She's suffered depression before.

190
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:58,073
You're being too mean. Stop it and talk to her.

191
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:03,585
You've got even. Made her feel too guilty. I think you should talk to her now.

192
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:06,140
Please, Monsieur,

193
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,818
No lecture today.

194
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,843
Gotta say...

195
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,798
Madame's mad for you.

196
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,020
No way she isn't.

197
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,350
If she were, she'd never ask me to work for her.

198
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,397
So you say she should've made you a business partner.
-Of course.

199
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:33,233
That's what they do if they're mad in love.

200
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,120
Way to go...

201
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,210
Novera seems to be missing you a lot!

202
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,936
Didn't I tell you not to poke your nose everywhere?

203
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,852
Novera's the one I told you about.

204
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:55,797
My cousin.

205
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,347
Oh...

206
00:12:57,347 --> 00:13:00,070
I get it now...

207
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,119
Mlle Novera l'Aloé Véra, innit?

208
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:06,331
Aye.

209
00:13:06,331 --> 00:13:07,977
That'd be her.

210
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,483
She's coming to Pakistan and everything will be settled then.

211
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,945
Good luck, mate.

212
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,117
There you are, Noriyan!

213
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:31,005
Mr Atif was asking about you.

214
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,790
Please don't call him Mr Atif like that!

215
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,944
You say he's like your son, but call him Mr Atif!

216
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:41,230
Besides, he doesn't consider you a servant.

217
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,353
Did he ask you to do something?

218
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,253
Yes...

219
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,620
Why didn't you get back?

220
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,580
What could I say? He asked for a girl's number.

221
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,093
Who?

222
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,967
A class fellow.

223
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,366
Why did he want her number?

224
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,678
Something about his work...

225
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:14,584
A photoshoot or something.

226
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:16,993
How does he know her?

227
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:22,550
I'd showed him a video of the play...

228
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,290
She was with me in it.

229
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,360
Why'd you have to show it to him?

230
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,900
What do you mean, Mum?

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,366
Let me be very clear.

232
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:35,990
I better not hear that you introduced any girl to Atif.

233
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,806
I don't want anyone to work with him because of you!

234
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:42,200
Mum...

235
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,150
Why do you hate Atif's work so much?

236
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:52,688
Look at how much people admire him, respect him... Look at his influence!
-Enough.

237
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:56,971
I'm interested in his work too, Mum.

238
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,490
You haven't seen what I have, have you?

239
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,592
I know the job very well...

240
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:10,381
It's okay in this profession.
-Oh, please!

241
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:15,130
I don't want you to be a part of anything Atif does!

242
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,740
And keep those you know away from him!

243
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,816
I don't like it one bit, okay?

244
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,220
Just --

245
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,140
Tell him...

246
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,826
You don't have --

247
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:28,412
Her number...

248
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,104
Alright, but...

249
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:36,245
Don't think so wrongly about his work.

250
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,903
A bit of it is no big deal, Mum...

251
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,140
C'mon, babes...

252
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,482
You know how this industry works...

253
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:53,820
None of those newcomers have the experience and skill you have.

254
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,000
Know what, you've been my personal favourite...

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,796
And of course, yes, my crush...

256
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,332
Excuse me, Atif...

257
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:03,424
Just a minute.

258
00:16:03,424 --> 00:16:04,727
Come in.

259
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,020
Mum asked me to meet you...

260
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,305
You sent for me?

261
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:11,219
I'd asked you for something.

262
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:14,760
I couldn't get her number, Atif...

263
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,595
You know it sounds so awkward to ask for someone's number...

264
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:19,976
Awkward, is it?

265
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,770
You must've rehearsed so much with her... Acted with her... But it's awkward to ask for her number, eh?

266
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,423
She won't be on Facebook either, right?

267
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:32,880
She's a real odd sort, Atif... Doesn't talk to anyone.

268
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,645
Not you, evidently...

269
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,524
Know her name? Or is it you couldn't even ask that?

270
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:43,963
Ah, yes, her name...

271
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,404
Malika... Yes, that's her...

272
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,377
Malika, huh?

273
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,698
Interesting...

274
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,060
Malika... Alright, go...

275
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,170
Okay. Thank you.

276
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,007
So where was I?

277
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,982
Sorry but I forgot...

278
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,200
Ah, yes...

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,603
What's with all this grief?

280
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:24,794
Who's died?

281
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:26,350
Not today, Zahir...

282
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,542
I'm very serious.

283
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:29,540
Sweetheart...

284
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,833
I bring excitement in your life.

285
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,800
Get up! On your feet!

286
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,170
Aren't you coming to Muzee's party?

287
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,828
You've been invited too!

288
00:17:37,828 --> 00:17:43,565
I'm in no mood for any party! Go and enjoy yourself. Leave me alone.

289
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,570
I'd left you alone...

290
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,276
When I shouldn't have.

291
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,558
I'm paying for it with these moodswings...

292
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,310
You start on the same old thing every time...

293
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,959
I told you, I don't want to go anywhere.

294
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,428
Give me your phone, will you?

295
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,832
Let me hammer some sense into that twit.

296
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,796
He's wrecked our happy life!

297
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:16,790
He's made a tragedy queen of a woman who was so full of life!

298
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,947
When was I ever lively?

299
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:23,430
Don't find excuses to start about him...

300
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,894
Fine...

301
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,115
The party's cancelled. I'm staying here.

302
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,443
Let's listen to some laments together.

303
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:34,301
Seriously?

304
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,695
Do I have a choice?

305
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,097
Alright, what'd you like to have?

306
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,562
You know it very well.

307
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:42,049
My favourite basil soup.

308
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,096
It's basil curry.

309
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:49,184
So I've been having curry, thinking it's soup all along!

310
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,937
Zahir!

311
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,873
Stop watching it. If Aqil caught you, I tell you!

312
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:43,872
Why?

313
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,230
Is it a crime?

314
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:49,680
Don't you remember how he caught you that day?

315
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,747
So he can gad about but we can't even do this...

316
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,766
Please, for Heavens' sake...

317
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:57,984
Why do you want to create a scene?

318
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,909
Why'd I have to be born in this blasted coop!

319
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,945
Their families don't stop them, do they?

320
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:06,520
But ours can't even let us watch!

321
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,625
Watch all you want over at Asim's.

322
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,111
No one will stop you.

323
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:15,953
Don't even mention his name before me!

324
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,956
But he's so nice...

325
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:24,107
How say you marry Mr Goody Two Shoes when I've gotten married?

326
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:28,624
But you won't marry him just like that, would you? You've got to do the whole thing...

327
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:33,530
Laying the tray before them, acting coy and all before getting married... Innit?

328
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,600
Just my two cents, but... Such pride doesn't suit anyone.

329
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,344
You just need something to be proud about!

330
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:22,375
Ms Sana looks so delighted today!

331
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,356
Looks like your report's been passed.

332
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,903
The boss has praised it too!

333
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:32,660
Oh my God! Congratulations! You finally got to hear some praise after all those earfuls!

334
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,209
Thank you.

335
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,061
And thank you, too, Asim.

336
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:39,531
For?

337
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,975
For your guidance.

338
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,020
It's nothing, really.

339
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,575
Just a few basics... Your report was fine.

340
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:55,730
Look at what you're saying, Mr Asim...

341
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,857
Ms Sana doesn't give credit to others just like that! Take it while you can!

342
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:04,260
Alright, if you say so.

343
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,870
You're welcome.

344
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,719
By the way, I'm right here if anyone needs anything.

345
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:13,925
I really need your help.

346
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:15,420
Yes?

347
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:21,955
Sana's got to give us a treat. No way she's giving us one if you don't help us!

348
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,905
Alright, I will!

349
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,038
You're too kind.

350
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:32,916
It's nothing.

351
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:36,942
I'd be glad to celebrate this with my friends.

352
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,650
Alright. Tomorrow. Lunch's on me.

353
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,690
We can have lunch again today if you say! We're all ready.

354
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,480
Aren't we, Anoushay?

355
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,298
Oh, sure, you will, Farah... But what about Mr Asim?

356
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,738
Tomorrow. For sure.

357
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,378
Okay, ma'am...

358
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,241
As you wish.

359
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,430
I hope it's okay, Asim?

360
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,958
Yes?

361
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,968
Okay...

362
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,458
Yeah?

363
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,351
Hello...

364
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,629
How are you?

365
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:48,078
I was waiting for you.

366
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,262
Me?

367
00:23:50,608 --> 00:23:52,939
I don't know you.

368
00:23:52,939 --> 00:23:55,650
I saw your performance.

369
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,430
I must say you've done a great job.
-Oh...

370
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,090
Thank you.

371
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,370
You're welcome.

372
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,985
Here.

373
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,387
Take my card.

374
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,013
But why?

375
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,710
I need you.

376
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,620
I can drop you if you don't mind.

377
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,680
We can talk on the way.

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,551
I don't even know you...

379
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:30,680
Getting in the car with a stranger...

380
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,112
Sorry.

381
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:39,172
I'm sure we'll get acquainted on the way, Ms Malika.

382
00:24:39,172 --> 00:24:42,498
How do you know my name?

383
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:50,016
You couldn't have any other name.

384
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,177
What an attitude...

385
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,520
Befitting none but an Empress [Malika]!

386
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,170
This is gonna be fun.

387
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,255
Take my card.

388
00:25:34,255 --> 00:25:35,788
But why?

389
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:38,376
I need you.

390
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,860
Alright, you may go...
-Hello, Aunt.

391
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,540
Hello, m'lad. Bless you.

392
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,000
Mr Sharif from the general store sent this.

393
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,160
Alright. Thank you so much.

394
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,344
I'll get going then...

395
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:50,270
Didn't he send the bill?

396
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,450
I paid him.

397
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,010
I had the money...

398
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,519
Alright, how much did you pay him?
-Way to go, Aunt...

399
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,560
You call me your son, right?

400
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,392
And that this is my home?

401
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:05,034
What's the big deal if I got some groceries?

402
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:07,707
It was just a small amount anyway.

403
00:27:07,707 --> 00:27:09,246
That's alright...

404
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:12,132
But every now and then... It doesn't seem right...

405
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:16,350
Alright, Aunt, pay me back when Aqil starts earning.

406
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,178
That day may never come...

407
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:23,992
He's not the type who'd take up any responsibility...

408
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:26,161
Aunt...

409
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,170
Why do you worry so much?

410
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,714
The Lord will ease things for us...

411
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,350
Asim...

412
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,565
You're not just his cousin but also his brother-in-law to-be.

413
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:39,908
Why don't you try to tell him?

414
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,562
I would if I ever saw him here!

415
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:45,299
I haven't seen him in months!

416
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,562
Right...

417
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:52,296
He's on his laptop all night and gets up in the evening.

418
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,671
God knows where he is all day.

419
00:27:54,671 --> 00:27:56,290
No idea...

420
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,690
Tell me...

421
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,860
What does he do on his laptop all night?

422
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,140
It's a disease that's spreading so fast, Aunt!

423
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,215
What do you mean?
-Social media!

424
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:11,980
Everyone's on social media these days.

425
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,160
Busy on their phones and laptops.

426
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,025
Alone even in 'gatherings'.

427
00:28:16,025 --> 00:28:17,756
Right...

428
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:21,870
But what is this social media thingy?

429
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,498
Hey...

430
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,529
I'm sure Malika can tell you better.

431
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,875
I'll get going.

432
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,648
Alright.

433
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,550
What good is all you education if you can't even greet a guest back?

434
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:57,347
Don't expect any civilties from me if the first thing I saw in here was your nephew!

435
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:01,847
Have some shame, Malika... He's your fiancé.

436
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,863
That's what he thinks.

437
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,840
I don't accept it at all!

438
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,140
You've been engaged for seven years!

439
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,052
Look at what you're saying!

440
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:12,378
I didn't get to choose seven years back.

441
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:16,374
Seven years is a long time to have second thoughts.

442
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:17,720
Oh?

443
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,237
What's your choice then?

444
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:21,868
Let me be clear -

445
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:25,053
I don't want to hear anything from you on this matter.

446
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:30,230
It's my life, Mum, and I won't let anyone ruin it just like that.

447
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,282
Who's ruining your life?

448
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:35,930
Asim's so nice. Why do you hate him so much?

449
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,987
Because I don't want to stifle my life!

450
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:46,347
He earns a good salary. They've got a home. Juggles two jobs. What else do you want?

451
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:49,144
How can a man who juggles two jobs keep me happy?

452
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:53,855
'Their home'! Which is chock-full of Aunt Salma's dowry!

453
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:57,827
And -- His clunker tells me just how much he earns!

454
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:03,306
As if we've got anything better! All this furniture was my dowry!

455
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:07,400
Thank God, because there are millions who don't even get so much.

456
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,905
And there are millions who've got everything, and more...

457
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:14,199
Aye. A few hundred. A few thousand, maybe. Thoughtless, all the rest!

458
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:18,110
Don't keep your head stuck in the clouds. It's a long way down.

459
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,790
My sweet Mum, if I've got my head in the earth, I'll keep sinking lower.

460
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,319
I want to soar high.

461
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,207
I hate those who crawl on the ground.

462
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,988
Malika...

463
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:35,336
I'm very worried...

464
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,981
Jeez, you're always worried!

465
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:40,684
I'm sick of you too!

466
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,600
Sorry. The number you've dialled is powered off. Please try later.

467
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,331
The number you've dialled is powered off.

468
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,492
Why are you here?

469
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:51,807
I didn't expect this from you.

470
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:54,310
You shouldn't have come here.

471
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,450
I hate those who turn tail.

472
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,410
I'm not here to upset you, but you're ignoring me.

473
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,432
Zoha...

474
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,982
Go. Please.

475
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,599
I'm telling you...

476
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,697
They're all talking about why you're here.

477
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,338
Please, get going.

478
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm going. But come over.

479
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,549
I'll be there. Go.

480
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,610
'You should be a model, Malika'.

481
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,770
Madame quite literally barged in!

482
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,806
'Barged in'? That moron...

483
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:46,803
No way. You're made for each other. The perfect pair.

484
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:50,492
Jeez, mate, I'm exercising!

485
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:54,662
I bet she ain't gonna leave you.

486
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:57,604
As if I want her to!

487
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,613
Why do you hurt her so much then?

488
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,540
I don't hurt her!

489
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,183
I just remind her what I am to her!

490
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:15,496
She's getting a bit rusted in the head with age.

491
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:18,715
What'd you two talk about?
-Oh, she doesn't talk!

492
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:22,321
It's a blimming speech! You don't know nothing!

493
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,400
Honestly, she's a headache...

494
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,790
AqiL, i DiDn't mEaN tO hUrT YoU... PleASe...

495
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,312
Jesus, man...

496
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,451
You're quite the clown yourself!

497
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,040
I mean...

498
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,880
Forget it... Back to your weights.

499
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,587
Don't even start...

500
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
