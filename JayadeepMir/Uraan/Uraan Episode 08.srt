1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Malika, where are you?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been texting you for ages, why don't you reply?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I'm busy. I won't be coming today.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wrote so much after that! Why didn't you reply?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I'm busy.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? M --

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who were you explaining yourself to?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should stay at an arm's length from whoever makes you explain yourself.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think it's bad to explain yourself in love.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very intelligent, and very confident. I like it.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me some time to think, maybe?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, take your time.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you won't turn me down.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
-Bye.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I had a problem with Malika studying, I would never have allowed her.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just asking you to keep an eye on her.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how it is these days.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only she listened to me...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, if Aunt doesn't want to go forward with the wedding, let her study.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her finish her studies.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were shouting as if you'd never let her go to university again!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, Mum... I was furious at her makeup that day.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just ask her to cover her face when she goes out.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how it's proper. That's all.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yeah, I almost forgot...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim called me. He's talked to his boss.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's called me for an interview.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God bless him.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'd fulfil his promise.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, you're excited like I've got the job already.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've just been called for an interview.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who does anything for anyone these days?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It matters.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd only be happy when I get my first paycheck.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May God bless you, and may that day come soon.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just great, my dewy-eyed Mum... You're just happy about my first paycheck.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your son's got the riches of paradise destined for him.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're just happy about one paycheck.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The riches of paradise... Destined for your son!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's for an international brand.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine the exposure...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine, that's your first chance.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just like a dream come true for you.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think carefully.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you said no, I'm cancelling the cheque, and if you said yes, you're getting double this amount at the end of the shoot.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about it

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And let me know.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to tell you...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I accept your offer.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's you.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're intelligent.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When's the shoot?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not right now.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you'd have to come everyday.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, it's obvious... You're going to need some grooming, after all.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry. You'll be paid for it.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what'd I tell them? At home?

65
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,332
That's your problem. Not mine.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, if you like, I can hire you permanently.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you tomorrow.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this goes here...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one on the sleeve...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say it all and be done with it.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need for this act.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to talk to you about something.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to hear anything about anyone.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not anyone. I want to talk about myself.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't go to university today.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, is it wrong to dream for a good life, Mum?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a job offer.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A job?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of my professors got me a job at her Dad's office.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to go from tomorrow.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You accepted it without asking or talking to anyone?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about your studies, that you were so horrified to leave?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't get a job half as good even if I finished my studies!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think of telling your brother.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or he'll box your ears!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, he won't!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, he doesn't earn a penny.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll tremble before doing anything of the sort.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's going today.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim's talked about him.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Donkey work, no doubt.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what if it is?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's respectable.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't turn it down.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've even got an advance for two months.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to see it?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give this cheque back, and tell them your family doesn't want their girls to work.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And they'll say, 'I'm sure they would've changed their minds if you'd shown them the cheque'!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could be so kind? And how?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't get stuck up in whys and hows when someone's been kind. You thank them. And Aqil?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can talk to Aqil myself.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'll you be doing?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much, really. Just proofreading some books. I can even attend classes when I'm free.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again, Malika.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust is hard to come by.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just trust me, Mum.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave everyone else to me.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you, Malika?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Busy with some things...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So busy that you forgot me?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you, Noriyan? How could I forget you?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been longing to talk to you all day.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been so bored without you here.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, get used to spending your days without me.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you saying that?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I won't be coming to university for a few days.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be busy elsewhere, Noriyan...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So busy that you'll forget me?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're being angry for no reason.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will be for real if you didn't come.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, in that case, I know just how to make it up to you.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although I'm sure that won't be necessary.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're taking me for granted, Malika?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, don't you care that I'd be angry?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know, Noriyan... Mum's not well...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Minahil's got exams... So I won't be able to come.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to Aunt?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing too serious. But I have to stay with her.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Let me know if I could help.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Thank you for asking.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll surprise you once I'm done with this shoot, Noriyan!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God you're not middle-class like me...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So different from me.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You understand me so well...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Where are you?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In your heart.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good one! I meant, are you at home?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here for an interview.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just forget it, will you?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just surprised you didn't even tell me.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I wish you the best of luck.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here after the interview.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've talked to the boss.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's waiting for you.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, listen.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speak confidently. Don't worry about anything.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't worryin' at all.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned, you're in for a real spectacle.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call me here to stare at me like that, sir?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't look that type... But you've got no manners.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ask before entering someone's office. I didn't ask you to sit down, yet here you are!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're asking for respect in advance! I mean, you haven't even given me the job yet...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, start the interview. We'll talk about it later.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd need an interview after what you've done?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know better than me, sir.
-You may show yourself out!

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, sir.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God knows why these bosses like to think they're gods!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, calm down.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My blood is boiling!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you better than you. I told you you can't do this job.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Work with me. We can work together. But your male ego!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't about male ego.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to mix my personal life with my professional life. There's a difference.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but I know your temperament so well.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got leadership qualities. Why do you want to trap yourself in some lowly job for a few bucks?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim had asked me.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I went.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's Asim?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My cousin.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My brother-in-law to-be.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I didn't go, everyone would've said I did it on purpose.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cool down and listen to me.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously, we'll make a good team and take our business places.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll have more time to spend with each other.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I thought you were actually worried for me.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at you!

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're looking for what suits you!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it suit you? Don't you want that?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about Zahir?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think Zahir would want to work with me.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had a row?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing of the sort...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I think he wants to start his own business.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All the clients in the market know you. You've got a great network.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good for you.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right. It's my business, after all. I've got to worry about it.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, are you coming to see me off tomorrow?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You forgot again?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to Dubai tomorrow.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I remember.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just kidding. I remember it.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scared you!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me, sir?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd recommended that lad, right?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't even know how to talk! And you recommended him for marketing?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my cousin, sir... My aunt worries a lot for him. That's why I talked to you.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want a stuck-up snob who doesn't even know how to talk to take up marketing for my company!

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understand, sir.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may leave!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you alright?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do I feel the boss has told you off?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're a seer, are you?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't mind it.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're almost right.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, m'boy.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Aqil come there?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was worried whether he'd even go there.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The interview's over.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Will he get the job?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't lie to you.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been embarrassed today. The boss called me and insulted me, too.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he hasn't seen a man more uncouth than him!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll talk to you when I get back.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera called.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants to go shopping with me.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you say?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you're expecting.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'Why don't you go with Waqas?'

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why doesn't she talk to me?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not start over this!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't. But I'll ask her.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, I thought I'd talk to Faizan.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About the marriage?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your engagement, for now. And your marriage, later on.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your typical Asian boy... I wouldn't dare turn you down!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're quite the actor! I give you that!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get ready, she's waiting!

261
00:18:26,389 --> 00:18:34,063
'Bonsoir, Madame'... What else do they say? 'S'il vous plaît'. 'Merci beaucoup'! 'Je vous en prie'... 'Intimité'!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You tried your best. But it just wasn't destined for him...

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no idea why he had to do it.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The boss said he's very rude.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His friends' flattery and infinite favours have spoilt him...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, what's the big deal if he earns some 20,000?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he doesn't show any sense...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right... That's why we're worried.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to humble yourself to work...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
...And you have to live your whole life that way.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And my brother would rather hold his head high.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Humility isn't disgraceful, Malika.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's quite the opposite.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure the boss didn't deserve the respect Aqil didn't give him.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough. You can see what spoils him...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim, would you help me with this question? I don't really get it.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Three common managerial'...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have dinner here.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aunt, I'll have dinner at home. Mum's waiting.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni, be done with it already!

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's got to go home.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going, Aunt. Okay. Bye.
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's better to stay quiet than say something so mean.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were you thinking, Aqil?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I'd talked to the boss for you.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were so rude to him!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my boss! He could've fired me!

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wasn't rude at all.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could see right through that man. I don't want to work for a grouchy man like him!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More like you don't want to work at all, if you ask me.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly! I don't want to work at a place where I have to say 'Yes sir' and 'May I, sir' to a grumpy old crab for a couple thousand!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It pains me so much.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It pains me too.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you want me to be insulted?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd want you to be insulted?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your boss was talking as if he had to give his company to me.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's the boss! He can talk the way he wants!

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I --

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you know I can't take it, Asim.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No good talking to you.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, listen to this!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me get this straight.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to debase myself for a lowly job.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You talked to him about my job. Thank you. Thank you so much.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please, don't. Ever.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see people for what they are.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I can't bow my head before a stuck-up old geezer.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be in a hurry. Take care.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Mum.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello... I've been waiting all day, you could've call --
-Please don't ask me anything about the interview.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll call me if it went well.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim told me everything.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the bleedin' limit.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you think they're just waiting to give you the job?
-Not at all.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did think Asim would find a job that suits me.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not his fault, though, Mum.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got his own world.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wants to imprison me in it.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard that?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I say I'm tired of living like this! Like Asim!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praise the Lord. He's living a happy life, and I'm sure it's staying this way.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't want to live this life.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I've already taken the first step to live the life I want to.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'll take you all the way...</i>

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'll take you all the way...</i>

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All the way to Heaven...</i>

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All the way to Heaven...</i>

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were you doing?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what I'm watching right now?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your shoot.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I look?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You might not believe it's you!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you. You're worth it.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How flattering!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't lie about anything. I say just what's true.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you send it to me? I want to see my pictures.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't send you the shoot. You know it belongs to the client.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Why can't I see my own pictures?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll show you when you come to office tomorrow.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be there.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's done.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get your payment ready.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. See you.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
-Bye.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he says you're almost right? But he can't see what's right in front of him!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think he's never really thought about me.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then why are you after someone so stone-hearted? Seriously, Sana, I don't really get you...

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I like him, Farah.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... You can't help it...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He looks good... He's nice, and all of that...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got a problem because you can love him but can't express your love.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Anyone there?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, tell him everything. At least you'll find out how he reacts.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether he's delighted or sad... I mean, he's totally unpredictable! You just can't guess!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I don't say anything, Farah.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be able to face him if he minded something I said.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Sana. It ain't no crime to love.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I love him.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But wouldn't it be a crime to love him if I told him and he just refused?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her unrequited love for Asim's sharpened her wits! Gotta say, I'm impressed!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on... Here's a little round of applause for you!

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's get back to work, shall we?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. You're lost in your thoughts all day. Even your tea's lost it.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember the loan I'd applied for?

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been approved.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll get a car in a few days.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, m'lad.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, I was very worried.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't think the boss would approve it after everything Aqil did.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't mind it, my dear...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you shouldn't have talked about Aqil in the first place.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my sister's son, but he doesn't deserve any favour.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did it for Aunt.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only Aqil could feel his mother's worries...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At his age, boys are mature... They become responsible... But he doesn't bother!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At his age! Well, maybe, if his father were with him...

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Responsibilities make one wise. But not everyone's like you.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask something, Asim?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you buying a car because you want to, or is it something else?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else could it be, Mum?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Malika didn't demand it?

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need more sugar.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so worrying!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yea -- No... I'll -- talk to Noriyan and work something out. I'll get back to you. Bye. Tell him I send my greetings.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? You look worried.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my sister-in-law. My brother's really sick.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you go meet him?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't do that. Who'd cook for you?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't embarrass me like that. He's your brother. Go to him for a few days. I've got many around here who can help.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be going for a few days. I'll leave in the morning and be back by night.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall I serve dinner?
-Yes. I'll go change.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rosy...

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You forgot everything now that your cousin's here!

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you? You're here after ages!

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's cooking, mate?
-Nothing, really.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to office regularly these days. And I've got to take Novera somewhere in the evening too...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... Take that drama somewhere else.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say Novera calls you, but it seems you're actually dying to go with her.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something like that. Aye.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're preparing for our engagement.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, hero.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When are you introducing me?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will, what's the hurry?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What 'bout you? How's Madame Zoha doing?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gone to Dubai for some work.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm surprised you didn't go along!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I refused.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You refused and she was okay with it?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I feel like closing this chapter forever.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've tried before. She won't leave you so easily.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think it's that simple.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but I tell you... She'd be dying to hear my voice the day I decided to put an end to it.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't see me again.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, I'm thinking of doing everything I can, settle some things, and do it sharpish.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what I think?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sometimes feel that you're the Devil dressed as a man.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see the Devil in all his red glory somewhere else.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just brilliant.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fantastic.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously. Don't get into any trouble.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I won't.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if I ever did, what good would friends like you be?

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, what good would friends like me be?

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Granny!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm great. How about you?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great!

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't tell you how much it delights me you're coming!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell Mum?

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then, please don't tell her.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's surprise her.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also, I'm not going to let you go back this time.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. You're not leaving us again, Granny.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, love you. Bye.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look so happy... Looks like it was someone really special!

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my Granny.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She lives in American. She's coming here after ages. I'm really excited.

468
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:37,753
Of course...

469
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:39,154
Lucky you!

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
