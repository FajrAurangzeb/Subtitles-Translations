1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you not coming to university?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no looking back!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and Noriyan have broken up. They're all talking about it here.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've sorted things out. Did you guys have to make it public?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who made it public?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a few pictures going viral. Is it you or Noriyan?
-What?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What pictures?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you know about your pics with Noriyan going viral?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check your WhatsApp, I'll show you.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, send me, double time!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, Noriyan!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you be so low?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Malika?
-What do you think?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're settling scores by making these pics go viral?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know what I can do to you!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What pictures are you talking about, Malika? What happened? What do you mean?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That officially does it!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for being with me all this time, Shakila. I can't turn you down. Not when it's Zeba's wedding gown. You'll get it.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I remember the day you started this, Zahida... With just one sewing machine...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And look where it's got you now! Bless you!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so happy for you. My kids look up to you.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, I almost forgot...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw some pictures of Malika on the internet... With a boy!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of pictures?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zeba told me she saw some pictures of Malika with him on the internet.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told her they probably study together. Someone must've clicked some pictures in the class or on a field trip and shared them. But they think they're going out together!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen so much that I just can't know what's right. I even asked Zeba to stay out of it.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll get going. I'll need these two weeks from now. Bye.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Aunt Shakila just say?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shakila said she saw some pictures of you with someone on the internet.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- some pictures from a field trip -- and some extracurricular activities...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know Noriyan's done it! He -- He wants to shame me!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Aqil!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just chill, bro. Relax.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who had these pictures?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I clicked them and I only shared them with Malika!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, everyone wants to talk to me.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to me.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Switch it off.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If no one else had these pics, Noriyan, I'm sure no one else could've done it.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? I leaked these pics myself?
-Not you! But Malika?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What rubbish! Why'd she even --?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, he's with me.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had him switch his phone off.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was Naveed. He was worried why your phone was off.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you told Salma, Zubeida?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I say? Everyone's talking about it. You only need to listen!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It worries me so much...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She left the place so furious... Blimey... Where's she gone, by the way?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To her sister's, of course.
-But why is she so worried? I'm sure it was something you said.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Bilqis, I haven't even started about what they're saying.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, have you broken Asim and Malika's engagement?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that... They just want some time. Until Malika's graduation?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't just about that. Mark my words, there's something dodgy going on here.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you seen Malika's pictures?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah yes, you don't use the internet... But I'm sure Asim's seen everything!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of pictures?

73
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:38,926
She's with someone! And - gorblimey - she's closer to him in those pictures than women would be to their husbands!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't be saying that for someone's daughter, Parvin. It's a sin!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell Malika it's a sin.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you're mistaken.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me... I just showed Salma those pictures. Everyone else has already seen it.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why she's gone over to her sister's.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, get Malika out of Asim's heart.

80
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,959
She's unseemly. Wants to soar too high.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God knows where he's gone!

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He even left his phone here!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what else she's got in store for us!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...
-Salma! It's you...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this I hear?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we go again...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not how you talk to your Aunt! Go inside!

88
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:49,146
Got a score to settle with us? I never thought I'd live to see pictures of you with some of the lads going viral on the internet!

89
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:54,756
Blimey, Aunt, what's up with all of you? Open your eyes!

90
00:08:54,756 --> 00:09:05,027
He studies with me, I've done a lot of assignments with him... But I didn't come on to him, so he edited a few pictures and shared them! How's it my fault?

91
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:10,468
You should be more careful. A woman's honour is fragile.

92
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:16,907
Well so is a man's honour. In fact, the bigger the man, the more fragile his ego!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come. Sit.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

95
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,277
You sent Aunt, didn't you?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!

98
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:55,452
Can't believe that's what you think, seeing how you're with women at the office all day!

99
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:57,152
What happened, Malika?

100
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:00,992
A class fellow uploaded some pictures he clicked with me.

101
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:07,947
I pulled him up right away. But I'm being tried here like I've been caught in the act!

102
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:11,318
But why were there any pictures to begin with?

103
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:21,167
You take the ladies for a ride, you invite them over, but you have a problem with a few pictures! Just -- Wow, Asim...

104
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:25,631
I have no problem, Malika. I'm just asking you.

105
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:30,977
Get some sense into Aunt. She shouldn't be listening to the rumours and accusing me!

106
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:37,027
Okay, don't worry... I'll do s -- Hello? He --?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Careful...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This way. Mind the step!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in, Asif.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan!

111
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,857
Lie down.
-What happened to him?
-Nothing serious, Aunt.

112
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:00,856
What happened, Noriyan? Noriyan? Good Lord...

113
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:04,127
It's nothing, Aunt... Just a dust-up at the university.

114
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,937
He isn't the type!

115
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:10,426
Don't worry, Mum... I'm fine.

116
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:14,716
Aye, right, Aunt. He just wants your sympathies. He's acting it out.

117
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:19,236
He's been hurt so bad... Just look at him!

118
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:22,687
Don't worry, Aunt.
-We'll get going.

119
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:28,626
Here's your phone, bro... You better keep it off if you want any peace.

120
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:32,120
And please don't worry about it too much.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, bye, Aunt.
-Bye.
-Asif...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me - what happened? What's it about?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't about Malika... Is it?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Tell her.)
-Malika's officially done it.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She sent her brother to the university.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was furious. He's the one he had a row with.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what Malika told him!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. He beat Noriyan real bad...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, don't worry. Please let us know if you need anything.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been? You even left your phone here. I was so worried you may pick a fight with someone!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I could have my way, I swear I would've killed him!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, killed him and left me to beg for your life!

133
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:02,736
And why are you here?

134
00:13:02,736 --> 00:13:06,532
Here to thank me for sparing her son apparently!

135
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:11,171
He won't be so lucky if I saw him again!

136
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,624
Please, spare him...

137
00:13:18,303 --> 00:13:23,380
My poor son's harmless... He can't hurt a fly!

138
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,461
Whatever he may be, he ain't harmless.

139
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:32,431
What's he done?

140
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:37,401
Leaked a bunch of pictures he clicked with me to get even!

141
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,932
No.

142
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:41,592
He can't do that.

143
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:48,072
He doesn't let me say a word against you. How do you even think he'd...?

144
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:55,338
You're his Mum... You're siding with him.

145
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:59,398
She's your Mum. Ask her.

146
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:05,829
A mother always knows her children. In her heart. Even when she doesn't say it.

147
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,259
My son's just not the type!

148
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:16,073
Please ask your son to stop thinking about my daughter.

149
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:23,849
I promise you... He won't even mention her name.

150
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:28,968
In fact, he's stopped thinking of her already.

151
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,898
I've got no one but him... Please spare him.

152
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:39,318
I can vouch for him.

153
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:42,023
Please, spare him...

154
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:50,669
I won't be able to repay your favour, but I'll pray for mercy for you.

155
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,132
I better not see his face again.

156
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:05,229
You won't. I promise you.

157
00:15:05,229 --> 00:15:16,359
You'll never see him again. He won't even think about you. I promise you...

158
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,689
Just talk to Aunt and throw her out already!

159
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,419
What? You're still thinking of Asim?

160
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:29,470
Zip it!

161
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,101
You better not shout at me again!

162
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:35,141
I don't want to marry him!
-Why?

163
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:38,181
Why not?

164
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,723
Does she want to mooch about here all her life?

165
00:15:40,723 --> 00:15:42,657
I'm not bothering anyone here!

166
00:15:42,657 --> 00:15:48,948
No... Daughters are not sent off because they bother anyone...

167
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,568
Just a minute...

168
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:54,648
What do you mean that you're not bothering anyone here?

169
00:15:54,648 --> 00:15:58,928
I've started working. Haven't you told him?

170
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:03,058
Well --
-Hold on... What does she do? What's she been up to?

171
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:10,048
I thought I'd tell you... But I thought you'd get angry and stop her from going to work.

172
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:13,568
But you still let her.

173
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:21,049
No... I didn't allow her... She decided everything herself! Even got her advance and all...

174
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,668
So that's what I'm worth here!

175
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:27,128
Nobody asks me about anything!

176
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:30,458
No way she's going to work!

177
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,789
But she's got a big advance...

178
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:39,029
So... Where do you work?

179
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:41,730
It's my friend's Dad... I work for him.

180
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,803
C'mon. I wanna see him. Come!

181
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,540
So you can create a scene there? Don't think you can fool me!

182
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,635
Just take him to your office. What if you needed something?

183
00:16:53,635 --> 00:17:00,655
I wanna see what she does that pays her a hefty advance!

184
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:02,356
I've left the job!

185
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:08,377
They don't let you quit the job so easily if they give you an advance! She's lying right in front of everyone!

186
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:12,596
One step out of the house, and you're dead. Get it?

187
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:18,436
Why? Just why? You don't earn a penny yourself, but you're bossing around like --

188
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:22,456
Shut your trap! I'll tell you! Come!
-Calm down, Aqil! Aqil!
-Mum!
-Geroff!

189
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:30,916
Stop it! Let her go!
-C'mon, now. Out. Quick!
-Mum!

190
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,766
Are you outta your mind!?

191
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:37,547
What are you doing?
-Open the door!
-Stop it, Aqil!
-Geroff me!

192
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:39,771
Be done with it!

193
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:44,201
Open the door, Mum!
-You're being too hard on your sister!

194
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:52,671
Open the door! Anyone!
-No one opens this door! Are we clear?

195
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,862
Please open the door, Mum...
-Good Lord...

196
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,674
Mum! Please say something!

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, swinger!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd miss me. But you never called! So I thought I should.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at what she's been up to!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at all the men who call her!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send her off right away!
-But how?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't force her.
-But I can! And I will!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?
-I'm gonna talk to Asim.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is plain cruel. You should've asked him to open the door!

207
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:25,374
You cage them when you can't cage their brass neck.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're siding with Aqil!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's done it because of Malika's shameless audacity.

210
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,174
What if she did something?

211
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,554
He locked her in because she might do something.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why you think so wrongly of her!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been? Didn't you hear me?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd gone to Aunt.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt? Why?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't see her, but I've talked to Asim.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you told him?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told him Malika won't say no this time. They can come and take her anytime.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you touched in the head? You want to embarrass me again?

220
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:29,650
I swear, you won't be embarrassed. If she dared to refuse now, she'll have to face me.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please unlock the door to her room...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open the door. She ain't going nowhere.

223
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:07,336
I better not hear that you took one step out or called anyone!

224
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,286
Are. We. Clear?

225
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:20,499
Back off! I don't want your sympathies!

226
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,689
Leave her, Munni.

227
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:29,050
You were sorry for her... But let me tell you, she doesn't deserve it!

228
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,760
It'll only anger Mum and Aqil even more...

229
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,970
I don't care if it does! Get me my phone.

230
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,460
Aqil destroyed the phone. Someone was calling you...

231
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,820
What do I know who it was?

232
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,024
Someone must've dialled the wrong number! Why'd he destroy my phone?

233
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:53,944
Why does it bother you so much, then?

234
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:05,494
Please talk to Mum, Granny... I'm sure she'd listen to you.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know your Mum's got no problem talking about it. But it was always Malika who refused, not your Aunt.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her refusal isn't set in stone.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When a girl refuses, it's set in stone, so to speak...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please try to understand, Granny... She's got no problem now.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you know? Did you talk to her?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Aqil came here last night.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil? When'd he start caring about the family?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe you're saying that. He's her brother. I'm sure she's told him something.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can't be making it up!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure your Aunt would've told Salma herself if that were it.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt was embarrassed. That's why she didn't talk about it.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Please talk to Mum about it. I'm sure she'd listen to it. Please?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's started caring for you after shaming you before the world? Seriously, though. You've got no shortage of matches.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... I can't believe this is happening. Mum's cross now that Malika's got no problem with it.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma told me she never cared for you and insulted you so much. That's why she isn't happy about it.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've forgiven Malika.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please forgive her and ask Mum to forgive her too.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Don't worry. I'm sure Salma would talk about it, but I think your Aunt should've been the one to say it.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'd be glad to talk about it.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then... Let's see how it goes.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, man!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey there!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How you doin'?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw Novera the other day.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

263
00:24:55,794 --> 00:25:01,697
You're lucky. She ain't crabby like you. I had a blast with her.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just bumped into her, that's all!

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think you've started bossing around already?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Why do you want her to do as you want?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did she say something?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, mate... She said nothing! But when'd you get so possessive?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.
-That's what I said! But...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why does she think that?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Waqas I know is usually cool. Okay?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give her some space. Care about her. That's how you'll grow closer.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you siding with her?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm siding with her! I worry for you! I'm worried your stupidity may ruin your relationship!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not being stupid, okay?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I'll buy that... Can't hide it from your relationship guru.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my experience, my dear Waqas...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better do as I say. It's for your own good.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now, fix your mood. Back to your exercise. You're here so late and in this godawful mood!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni called you for lunch twice. You shouldn't be so adamant about everything.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me starve to death. I'm sure that's what you're all waiting for!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, we're not. You're creating trouble for yourself.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say good riddance to me!

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... God's given you another chance.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's told Asim you've agreed to marry him.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether he or your Aunt believe it or not, Aqil's sure you won't say no.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not his bleedin' slave!

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be responsible for whatever happens to you...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would Asim and Aunt agree after all that's happened?
-Yeah.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They will.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who care for their family can forgive and forget everything.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want any favours.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope we're clear that I'm never saying yes to him!
-I hope we're clear, too, that I may not be able to save you again.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've transferred 500,000 to your account. Check that you've got it.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I told you something, Zoha.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I told you it's not for you, too.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say it's my gift to your sister on her wedding.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be of use to her.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd already given me the money... Just my luck that I ran into those robbers...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you please forget it?

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I think...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All this love...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your favours...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I may never be able to pay any of it back...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never leave me, okay?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anything else.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I could ever leave you?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come so far because I trust you.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just be there for me.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so addicted to your love...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I can't even imagine my life without it...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what I'd do without you.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I say...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's end this distance between us. Move in with me...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here every other day, Zoha.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I practically live here.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean we should get married.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never said no.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, Zoha...

333
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:55,296
I've got so much on my shoulders right now...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After we get married, I'm sure we ca --
-But...

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get it...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So leave it to me.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of it.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say...

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you say...

342
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,155
The definition of true love, that!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It seems so selfish...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't care one bit about me... Even after everything I've done for you...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all about give and take, you know...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask me, there's a simple formula to fulfil every dream...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to come back when you've understood it.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would Asim and Aunt agree after all that's happened?
-Yeah.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They will.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who care for their family can forgive and forget everything.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want any favours.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope we're clear that I'm never saying yes to him!
-I hope we're clear, too, that I may not be able to save you again.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're creating trouble for yourself.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's right...

356
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:52,626
I created this problem...

357
00:32:52,626 --> 00:32:56,366
It's up to me to solve it!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and tell Aunt...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no problem...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni...

362
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:21,418
Did you hear what I heard?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Aunt, quick.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What made her change her mind?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Mum! Just call Aunt. Asim would be at home. It'd be great if he heard it too!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call her in the morning.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum... Now --
-I told you I'll call her in the morning. Tidy this up, okay?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!
-For what?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Aunt called at last!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does she say?

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What Aqil told you.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika has no problem now.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? Wow!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's hope it's the best for all of us.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why don't you seem happy?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not it... It's just... A strange fear... No idea why... Ever since you told me she's okay with it...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you worried about, Granny?

381
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:33,497
You and Malika are poles apart! Ask your Mum if you don't believe me!

382
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,662
Blimey... Please don't talk about Mum...

383
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:44,462
She thinks Sana's the only match for me in the entire world!

384
00:34:44,462 --> 00:34:46,018
Oh, please...

385
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,600
Don't even start...

386
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,229
The last thing I want to hear is you comparing Sana with Malika.

387
00:34:51,229 --> 00:34:53,789
I've never seen anyone like her.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just mistaken about her.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you Malika'd said it without thinking.

390
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,785
She loves me!

391
00:35:02,785 --> 00:35:05,452
And I'm sure we'd be very happy together.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'd only be happy with her. That's why I always prayed that the Lord show her the way.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope your prayers work.
-May the Lord keep the two of you happy.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're angry because Aqil met me and I didn't tell you?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've had no problem if you told me, but Aqil! I was so furious when he told me!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Problem'? What kind of problem? He just bumped into me and couldn't say know, because he's your best friend, right?

399
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:43,198
Exactly! He's my best friend! What's he to you? Nobody!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What...?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this nonsense? I was just being polite?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Novera, let me try to explain it.

403
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,090
You don't know the people here. You don't know what they're like.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I don't know what they're like? Or are you just too wrong?
-Blimey, you're out to prove me wrong!

405
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,280
Why are you shouting?
-Cripes! I'm not shouting! I'm not shouting, okay!?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry!

407
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:18,669
I just wanted to tell you they're not what they look like!

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not trying to explain anything, you're just trying to set my boundaries!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you please not be so wrong about me for once?
-You are wrong!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not wrong! You talked to Aqil about us! Told him everything! Why'd you tell Aqil I'm possessive? That I don't give you space, I force my will on you? Tell me!

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is too much! I gotta leave. I just can't understand you. Bye!

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Novera --

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just gotta go, Aunt. I've got something important to do. I gotta leave. Bye, Aunt! Take care!
-You can't just leave like that! But --

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something happened here?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, she's a weird one!

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Try to tell her something and she flares up!

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you to tell her anything?

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted to tell her not to talk to Aqil about us!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on...

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did she meet Aqil?

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bumped into him at the mall.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
