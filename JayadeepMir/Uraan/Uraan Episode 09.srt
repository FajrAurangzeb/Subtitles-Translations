1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you like it?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just fantastic!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even believe that's me!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hasn't anyone ever told you you're so photogenic?

6
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:10,714
The mirror tells me everyday.

7
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,724
I don't need to bother asking anyone else.

8
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,023
Blimey...

9
00:01:14,023 --> 00:01:16,263
That's some real attitude.

10
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:17,703
I like it.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know that being so lovely has its benefits?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can get a lot if you know how to use your charms!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't be that special.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's something about you that pulled someone like me to you.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I really mean it.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're too kind.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does he do?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one you're thinking about.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, forget him...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, seriously.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm jealous.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you wouldn't mind it...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say we go out for lunch today?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't bother yourself, it's okay.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be my pleasure.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And sorry, but I nearly forgot.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You forgot to sign the contract. It's just a formality. Sign it.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The other two pages as well.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's nice.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can go tomorrow if he's really sick.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talked to Uncle. He's better now.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This headache won't go away so easily... It bothers for days and days...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you go today?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can visit him again in a few days.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take you to the doctor.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll give me the same pills.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no other way.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Aunt called to inform us. It won't look proper if neither of us went there.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I won't stay there too long.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be back by the evening. Don't hurry so much that they mind it.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some rest.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of course...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd cooked lunch for Mr Atif last night.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've taken the pills. I'll get some rest.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to go alone...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like he'd eat you...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how much he loves you.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Mum.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I don't want to go alone.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone would be asking about you.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call me when you get there. I'll talk to him.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell him about this headache.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please don't get back on duty when I've left.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord, get going. You'll get late.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'm going.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't feel better, just ask Uncle to take you to the hospital.
-Yeah, I will... Go, now.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of music do you like?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Depends on the mood.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I listen to what I feel like.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what do you feel like listening to right now?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm good with what's on right now.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to come over to my place?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot some of my papers. I'll go get them, and you can have a look around. What do you say?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll be stopping at my place for a while.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This here's the drawing room. That's the dining room.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you like it?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed it is today...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't anyone else around?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that you're here, I don't need anyone else.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You totally forgot! You'd come here to get some papers...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you make a fantastic coffee?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like to try some.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The kitchen's that way.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He lies when he calls you.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only I can you your dream life.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're still here?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was a bit sick, so...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came here when I heard the car stop. Thought you might need something.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... My apologies...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, she's our maid. She lives in the basement.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't be coming back. Sit.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I think we should get going.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you, she won't be coming back. Have some coffee?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some other day? Let's get going -- Please?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, my dear.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.
-What's these sweets for?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm done with my exams! Right?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've bought a car.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you. Bless you, my dear.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you, Asim.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've got to take me for a ride!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyday you want, Munni!
-Done.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.
-Hey.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim's bought a new car.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme guess. The four-banger parked outside.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. How do you like it?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not leaving before having some tea.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some of this.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'll pass. Besides, I'm on a diet.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll bring these on a plate.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least congratulate me, will you?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

135
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:12,555
I bought a car because you didn't like my bike.

136
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:16,525
Changing things you don't like. Good for you.

137
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:22,256
Please, could you not be offhand for a change?

138
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:25,356
Don't expect any love from <i>me</i>.</i>

139
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:31,959
Everyone's got the right to wish to live, and you're the only reason I'm alive.

140
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,160
Jesus, be done with your cornball dialogues already.

141
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,360
Please don't try my patience.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'll pass, Aunt. I got to go.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd Asim leave so suddenly?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good for him...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's not respected...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't change!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get your tea.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations. God bless you.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get ready. You're the first one to get to ride it. You got to do as I say!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, you're so tired. I'm not going anywhere.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you don't like the car?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Asim? Who'd like it if not your mother?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then, get ready quickly. I won't take a no this time. In fact, we're eating out today, and I'm taking you shopping!

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I should be roaming about at my age? How say you take Mal --

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can ride all she wants when the time comes. But it's your turn today.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and get ready quick.
-Okay, give me a moment. I'll go change.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are your hours like? It's so late in the evening!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't worry about hours when you're making a bundle.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may be making a bundle, but it doesn't mean you have no schedule!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These overheads are not for our work, but to shut us up.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that we can't turn them down or object to anything.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had your lunch?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The least one could do is be happy for someone else.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim had come here to celebrate with us even after he was practically thrown out.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't want to celebrate with us.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wants that I should smile, laugh and live for him and him alone!

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know it... But that's his love.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't no love, Mum, he's so pig-headed!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're pig-headed!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't even be happy for someone.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were all wishing you well.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank them all...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle's much better now.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He even said he'd be coming here to see you.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God bless him, he's so nice.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May He bless his children.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He told me he didn't really feel like sending Noriyan back. Didn't he ask you to stay?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you even think I'd stay there when you're unwell?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! It was just a headache! The pill worked and it's gone.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are Naazi and Ashi?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Naazi's fine. Prepping for her private FA.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I didn't even see Ashi.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great... Bless her!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how a modest girl should be!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, though, Mum... I didn't really like it.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told Uncle.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be too bad if he hoped for something.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Uncle is hopeful you'd do as he wishes.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't marry Ashi!

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say it, will you, Noriyan?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my only son.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to do what makes you happy.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love someone, Mum.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's very nice.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one you love can never be bad, innit?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's really nice, Mum!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I bring her here?
-Don't even think about it!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't like anyone coming here with you before getting married to you.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you be any different from --

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Atif?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Atif bring anyone here? A model, maybe?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone like himself, maybe.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Soaring too high in her dreams...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take it so wrongly... It's his profession... She must've been here for some work.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea how her type can forget about their parents' honour... Or even their own!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, Atif's very smart.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought her here when he thought you won't be around.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just great...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't good at all!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better not hear anything about it again.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks, Mum.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zahida called. She congratulated me.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's as delighted as you.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she'll be coming, but I know she won't.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's embarrassed because of Malika's refusal.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her she's got nothing to be ashamed of.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go and get her here myself.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where does Sana live?
-No idea, Mum.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never asked.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you never will. I'm sure you would never have asked her to sit like I did.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I? She was there for work.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she stopped to congratulate me.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seem a bit too interested in her.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's so nice, if you ask me. Almost like family.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, she's nice. Cares for everyone at the office.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Including you?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring her here someday. She said she'd come.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just said it, so to speak.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring her here if she wants to.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go for dinner today.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I have to go. I got late yesterday.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to forget about the time if you want to get where you want to.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but Mum doesn't really know about what I'm doing.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, just tell her. It'll ease her worry.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just yet...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't even told the one who will support me.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who? Your boyfriend?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be sure he'll support you.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves me so much.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A man fears for his honour when his lady tries to race ahead.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He forgets everything about love.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, his Dad's a big businessman.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're not conservative like my family.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be glad to know I'm doing something big, something good.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever met his family?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. His parents don't live here. He'll introduce me to them when they're back.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How innocent...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Good for you...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell him anything about me or the shoots until his parents have been to your place.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's some things you need time to find out...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wait and watch.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's very nice, Atif. He's not like that.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say that for now...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure time will tell if we're right...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, don't worry. Cheer up.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This ain't the time to get worried.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have your coffee.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've finished.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your surprise? Tell me.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess who I saw when I went shopping yesterday!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at your excitement, Asim! Was it him?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just him. His Mum, too!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's such a nice lady! So affectionate! Almost like family. It didn't feel like I'm meeting her for the first time!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Apparently, it's a case of unlike mother, unlike son!

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just look at how you crave for Asim's affection!

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kinda...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim didn't feel very good about it. He was like, 'Where'd you drop in from'?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Aunt invited me. She wanted to sit with me for a while.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow... Really?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because nothing in the world could make Asim say that!

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought about what you're going to wear?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not yet...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A man fears for his honour when his lady tries to race ahead.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He forgets everything about love.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell him anything about me or the shoots until his parents have been to your place.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where've you been? I've been calling you all day, but your phone's been off!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was busy, Noriyan!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea where...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you ever think about me?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. That's why I'm calling you the moment I'm free.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got good news.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told Mum about you.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When's she coming here?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Soon. Very soon, I promise.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you meet me at the university?
-You don't need to ask.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I miss you so much when you're not there.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you to stay back after class!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to talk to you.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like what you think. We're good friends!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Farhan's sent you.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, man! As if he'd say and I'd do it!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said what I thought was right that day.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my friend! I'm so worried to see you like this.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like anyone saying anything about my personal matters.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I promise I won't.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, fix your mood.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My mood's good. At least think of what you're saying.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, mate, I won't say anything. Okay?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm invited to the wedding, right?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My wedding?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it ain't that far off! You look so good laughing!
-Jeez, mate, back off. Enough, now...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, think before saying something.
-Alrighty. Smile now, will ya?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now, let me play!
-As you wish!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning, everyone.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asif, I'd like some coffee.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's Aunt?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good. Better now.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice to meet her.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, I'm sure you should see her again sometime. What do you say?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was pleased to meet you too. She said she almost felt like you're family.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Sana's so nice. Don't you agree?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure your Mum would've asked about me.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who I am, where I live... About my family?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't care about any of it. I'm her only son. She just wants to see me happy.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a bad feeling about this...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid of losing you.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you even think about that?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never leave me, okay?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Malika?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it your love you don't trust, or mine?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your love gives me hope...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? What are you thinking?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ever had to choose between my love and your happiness... Which would it be?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say that as if they're any different.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're the same to me.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Things don't always stay the same.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got this mansion, cars, riches... Everything.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if I lost it all tomorrow?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you still carry on with me?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying? That's impossible!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just imagine it did.
-But why?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be so difficult to choose between my love and my happiness.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just said it for me... 'I'll always choose you, Noriyan'.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't seriously expect someone whose Mum's worked all her 'humble' life sewing to choose love.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd want her happiness at all costs, Noriyan.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll keep you happy.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, Granny, how was your journey?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great, but blimey, so tiring... It's such a headache, waiting it out in the plane!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't look well.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of course... What else do you expect at my age?

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how's Aunt?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's great. Everyone's having a ball over there.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't she want to come here?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They think with their brains there. Not their hearts.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've got their hands full there... Never mind if they don't want to come here. I love to come here for my grandson and daughter-in-law.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of which, where's she?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma!

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's cooking something for you.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're here after so long, I'm sure she's planned a real treat for you.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, you don't know how I've lived so far from you so long.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're here, now, Granny, and I won't let you go.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't come here to go back. Not until you've brought your bride, Malika!

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't seriously expect someone whose Mum's worked all her 'humble' life sewing to choose love.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd want her happiness at all costs, Noriyan.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something worrying you?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing at all...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can totally believe that.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's her name again?

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika [Empress].

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sounds nice.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope she doesn't act like one!

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do names affect how we act?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not really, but...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes...?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When are you taking me to her place?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it that's troubling you?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me. I can help you.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lied to her...

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks I'm rich. Very rich.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It shouldn't be too difficult for you.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell her the truth.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't do that...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told so many lies to hide this one.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her the truth. Make up for every time you've lied to her.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be hurt.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurt, or... Leave you?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Mum, she won't leave me.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves me.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, just tell her.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the worst that can happen? She'd be cross for a few days, maybe?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want her to be cross with me.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have lied to her in the first place, then!

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to tell her the truth many times... But I couldn't do it.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got no other option, Noriyan.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't talk about your marriage until you've told her the truth.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Mum...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell her...

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not here. What happened?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the shoot's done. Why do I have to come everyday?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not even if I wanted?

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want?

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to see you.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you need a reason to see me... How about another shoot?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?
-Yeah.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here tomorrow.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got an international client. It's a high-profile shoot.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...
-You'll be making a lot of money...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think so much, Malika.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you, you were born to rule this field.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be getting a lot of offers. Get used to it.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be there.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you tomorrow.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
