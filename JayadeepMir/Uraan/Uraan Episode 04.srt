1
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,653
Who're you talking to?

2
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,970
You have no idea...

3
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,610
I thought it's Asim.

4
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,386
You don't know me if you did!

5
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,010
Mum...

6
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,199
Malika can be so brutal...

7
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:36,309
What happened?

8
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,488
I mentioned Asim.

9
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:41,100
She got so rough...

10
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,976
I mean, just look at how much Asim and Aunt care for us.

11
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:46,509
They're so nice...

12
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,255
But Malika... She doesn't have a care in the world!

13
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:54,164
She just doesn't listen...

14
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:55,699
Munni...

15
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:59,400
I hope she's not seeing anyone else?

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,104
How'd I know Mum? It's not like she'd tell me.

17
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:09,605
But I suspect it sometimes... That she's... You know, seeing someone...

18
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:12,889
That's why she hates Asim.

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:19,478
I have no idea, Mum... Why don't you ask her yourself?

20
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,669
I will.

21
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,102
What'll you ask?

22
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,260
Nothing.

23
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:31,927
If what I think is true, I swear, I'll cut that sharp tongue!

24
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,775
You better not ask me then.

25
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,640
If you liked or commented on her picture again, I'll feed you your teeth!

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,750
Go and ask Malika not to put such pics up! You can't even control your girlfriend --
-Hold it, Noriyan! Leave him.
-Noriyan!

27
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,020
What happened?
-Get off!

28
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,470
It's all because of you! You love to show everyone your charms, don't you?

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,100
Go and get into modelling or something! But forget me!

30
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,622
What's up with him?

31
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,550
What's up with you, Noriyan?

32
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,470
Why did you create a scene? It's just a picture!

33
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,080
So much for love! At least you could've find a half-decent excuse to leave me!

34
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,360
I told you to deactivate your Facebook account.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,834
You want to control me?

36
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,561
I uploaded the picture because I liked it.

37
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,304
What's the big deal?

38
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:35,824
It's a big deal because you don't listen to me at all.

39
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,520
You know I don't like it.

40
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,722
You just like to keep me caged...

41
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:49,129
I can't live freely at home... And now... Even you...

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,931
Malika...

43
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:54,546
Please don't cry.

44
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,410
You know I can't see you crying.

45
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,950
You can't see me in tears but you can hurt me.

46
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,620
Everyone would be laughing at me... That my boyfriend can't trust me.

47
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,221
Just one pic and he created a scene...

48
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:14,980
I wish I'd never met you!

49
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,980
You're just like my family... You want to keep me caged... Can't let me be free...

50
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,320
Malika...

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,121
I didn't mean to...

52
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:26,959
I didn't mean it that way...

53
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,207
You want to upload pictures? Post whatever you like. I won't stop you.

54
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:35,090
But...

55
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,226
Take care that...

56
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:40,963
People don't respect you just because of the pictures...

57
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:44,067
But because of who you are.

58
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,752
Well that's what I am!

59
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,770
Alright...

60
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,832
Just be who you are. No worries.

61
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:55,806
I'm here for you.

62
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:59,290
I don't want this cruel world to lay its eyes on you.

63
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,940
I just want that you do whatever you do for me.

64
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,855
Fix your mood, will you?

65
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,411
Munni!

66
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:20,460
Yes, Mum?

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,016
What are you doing?

68
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:26,583
Aqil gave me these clothes to iron last night.

69
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:32,570
I've told him not to borrow his friend's clothes so many times. It doesn't look proper.

70
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,242
No need to tell him.
-What can I do?

71
00:05:35,242 --> 00:05:38,160
I'm his mother. It hurts me...

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,274
But he never listens to me...

73
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:46,653
And it hurts me when no one listens to you...

74
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:53,490
You must be really strong to try to get some sense into him everyday.

75
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,135
I figure someone's been scoring her brownie points...!

76
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:59,858
Ever thought about my strength? I take earfuls everyday!

77
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,540
You couldn't care less!

78
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,760
Quick, Munni. I gotta go.

79
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,328
Care to tell where?

80
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,960
Jeez, why do you ask me everyday?

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,630
What do you want? Stay home like girls all day?

82
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,369
I've told you not to borrow your friends' clothes.

83
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:22,270
It doesn't do you any good but humbles you before them.

84
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,663
It's okay among friends.

85
00:06:25,663 --> 00:06:29,231
Sharing is caring, and it's very common among friends.

86
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:35,520
Waqas himself says these branded clothes and this colour suit me better.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,689
This flattery costs us so dear so often...

88
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,570
What do you mean?

89
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,177
Doesn't your son deserve the compliment?

90
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:52,442
Leave it. Don't say anything. Ruined my mood...

91
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,760
I told you, Mum...

92
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,557
It's no use...

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,190
Hop on. I'll drop you.

94
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,480
No. I can walk.

95
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,241
What's the problem? I'm your cousin.

96
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:20,655
I know. But you sometimes forget you're my cousin.

97
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,447
I forget it?

98
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,200
No, you do.

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,890
We've swor --
-For God's sake, I've told you I don't accept what we'd sworn!

100
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:35,762
My Prince Charming can't be someone like that, okay?

101
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,959
Malika...

102
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,030
You only find 'Prince Charming' in dreams.

103
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,490
Open your eyes and you'll see he's gone.

104
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,731
I'm sure I'll find my Prince Charming if you kept your doomy self at an arm's length.

105
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:56,382
What do you want, Malika? I can give my life to win your love.

106
00:07:56,382 --> 00:08:02,810
For starters, you can try changing this outdated clunker-of-a-bike.

107
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,173
Then, we'll talk.

108
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:30,970
Work on the contouring, Mosin. And we can't do with this hairstyle. We're doing the first style I showed you, remember?

109
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,750
I'll have a look and check again. Fix the contouring. Everything else is fine.

110
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,579
Okay, sir.
-Quickly. We don't have time.
-Thanks.

111
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:45,236
Yes, what've we here?
-I think this look won't do.

112
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,647
It's you, Noriyan!

113
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:37,094
What brings you here? Come.

114
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,046
You asked for the keys, Atif.

115
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,338
Why are you here? Where's the driver?

116
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:46,930
His son is sick.

117
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,200
Why are you getting so worked-up? Take a seat. The shoot's about to start.

118
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,060
We're shooting a very interesting video.

119
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,394
No, Atif. I'll leave you to yourself.

120
00:09:57,394 --> 00:09:59,012
Sure?

121
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,134
As you wish...

122
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,684
Okay, back...

123
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,830
Mosin?

124
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,424
Yes, sir?

125
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:13,270
We're doing this look. Do this hairstyle, okay?

126
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,536
Okay sir, no problem. I'll get to it.

127
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,668
Hey, Mum.

128
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:26,907
Hello, my dear...

129
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:28,270
Munni!

130
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,958
Malika's here. Heat the food.

131
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,358
I've already heated it.

132
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:36,733
Your Majesty could've called before coming.

133
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:39,488
I could've served Your Majesty at the doorstep!

134
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:44,970
Oh, really! That is oh-so-kind of you. It's not like you've got ten dishes for me.

135
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,138
I was just kidding...

136
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,250
What's up with you the moment you step in?

137
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,450
I'm reminded my place!

138
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,260
You should thank God rather than complain.

139
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,271
He eases so many troubles...

140
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,558
What do I thank Him for?

141
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:09,329
He's made you complete, made you so beautiful...

142
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,730
We've never lacked anything...

143
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,152
He found such a lovely match for you in Asi --
-Gorblimey, Mum...

144
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,479
What do you want, Malika? I can give my life to win your love.

145
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:34,885
For starters, you can try changing this outdated clunker-of-a-bike.

146
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:37,104
Then, we'll talk.

147
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:40,010
I respect you, love you...

148
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,360
I'll keep you happy all your life.

149
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,424
Asim, I can't stand this blather.

150
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:49,190
You better show up only when you can get gold bangles instead of these garlands.

151
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,320
You better show up only when you can get gold bangles instead of these garlands.

161
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,201
No, Mum... Just thinking about... Things...

162
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,345
Asim...

163
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,887
Don't lie to me.

164
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:25,020
I'm your mother. I can see that you're worried about something even when you don't tell me.

165
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,460
I was thinking of buying a car.

166
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,890
A car?
-Yeah, the bike's getting old...

167
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,620
Ah, yes, so it is...

168
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,110
Your Dad bought it when you were in college.

169
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,201
It's very old.

170
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,220
I've saved some money. I thought I'd get some from the office.

171
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,360
We can get a car on instalments.

172
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,003
But must you get a car right now?

173
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,229
Everyone's got a car now.

174
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,480
Just look around. Everyone's got a car here.

175
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,340
I've lent some money. You can buy a car when I get it back.

176
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,100
But you've saved it for my marriage.

177
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,810
I have, but I can lend again.

178
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,875
Besides, I don't think Zahida will be getting Malika married this year.

179
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,006
Why?

180
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,387
Did you talk to her?
-Yeah.

181
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:16,580
She changed the topic.

182
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,888
Take me to her tomorrow.

183
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:21,253
I'll ask her what she wants.

184
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:24,570
Please, don't talk just yet.

185
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,513
Let Malika finish her studies first.

186
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:32,957
She can continue her studies when she's here. It's not like we're stopping her.

187
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,685
Alright, Mum...

188
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:37,950
Let me get a car first.

189
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,915
What's a car got to do with any of this, Asim?

190
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:45,428
Let me get things straight with her.

191
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,170
I still can't believe it.

192
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,250
Our brand and products are so famous!

193
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:01,702
Remember when we announced our business partnership, Zahir?

194
00:14:01,702 --> 00:14:05,930
Your Mum thought we wouldn't be able to do a thing.

195
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:11,337
She still doubts us. 'How can anyone get rich growing plants'?

196
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:16,888
I've thought of sending her a hamper with all our products.

197
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:18,788
When's she coming here?

198
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:22,158
Tomorrow evening. And you're coming to the airport with me.

199
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,381
I can't. Not tomorrow.

200
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,936
Why?

201
00:14:25,936 --> 00:14:27,955
What is it?

202
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,492
Not another excuse!

203
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,371
It's no excuse...

204
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm getting Aqil a sports bike. I'm going to a few showrooms.

205
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,240
What?

206
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,632
Are you out of your mind?

207
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:40,535
Why?

208
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,201
What's wrong with that?

209
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,204
You're buying him a bike?

210
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:50,299
As if you haven't done enough for the loser already!

211
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,440
Please, Zahir...

212
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,937
Why do you talk about Aqil like that?

213
00:14:54,937 --> 00:15:00,020
I do all of this for him because it makes me happy.

214
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,810
Alright, tell me - midnight blue or gun metal grey?

215
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,210
I value your tastes!

216
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,710
Bro...

217
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,348
Your girl's crazy. Get it?

218
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,834
She called me.

219
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,600
Why'd she call you?

220
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,380
You don't answer her calls, you've deactivated your Facebook account... So that just leaves me, doesn't it?

221
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,087
Good... She ought to know what it means to yearn for your love...

222
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:39,543
She says big words about love.

223
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:43,511
Be done with it, mate... How much more will you punish her?

224
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:49,980
She'll be out of my control if I didn't.

225
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,080
What do you mean out of your control? She's a woman, not a bloomin' machine!

226
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,870
Here's a tip. Call her and ask her to jump from the second floor.
-No way...

227
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,880
Why just the second floor? Why not the third or fourth floor? Good riddance for me forever!

228
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,416
What if she left a note? 'Mr Aqil made me do it'?
-Anything, really!

229
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:16,040
Like seriously, why would she name me?

230
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,770
I didn't promise her anything.

231
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:23,780
Do what you like... Just get me rid of her. Talk to her.

232
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,550
Why isn't he getting up?

233
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,714
I think he forgot it!

234
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:30,630
Then go and remind him!

235
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,523
What if he refused, Farah?

236
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:38,766
Congratulations! You would've met the first man in the world to refuse a party!

237
00:16:38,766 --> 00:16:40,384
Alright...

238
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,356
I'll go talk to him...
-Aye.

239
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:46,080
You sort it out with him. I'll place the order.

240
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,580
Alright... I'll talk to him...

241
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,325
Now's your chance to say it to him!

242
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:55,731
C'mon, Farah. I'm not going to talk about anything like that to him...

243
00:16:55,731 --> 00:17:00,901
Oh, really? So you're throwing this party for me?

244
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,045
Alright.

245
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:03,850
I'll talk to him...

246
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,363
Best of luck!

247
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,879
Uhh... You seem to be forgetting something...

248
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,180
What?

249
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,437
We were going to have lunch together?

250
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:29,019
Oh...

251
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:35,490
I'm so sorry, but I told you not to bother about it...

252
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,850
You're embarrassing me by asking me not to bother about it. It'll be my pleasure.

253
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,278
Please don't mind it...

254
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:46,039
I'd mind if you refused...

255
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,870
Alright. I'm coming.

256
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,637
Okay.

257
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,360
Shall we go together?

258
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,267
We're just going to the nearby restaurant.

259
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,280
It was Farah's idea --

260
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,556
I said we should get something delivered here, but --

261
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,827
Shall we?

262
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,390
And yes, I almost forgot...

263
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,531
She was asking for your address.

264
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:33,262
I hope you didn't give her!

265
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,770
I had to... She was almost pleading...

266
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,910
Jeez mate, are you touched in the head? What if she came knocking?

267
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,830
Won't it be great if she met her in-laws? It's a bonus if they like her!

268
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,814
Mrs Zoha Aqil...

269
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:57,284
I'm gonna whack you with this dumb-bell!

270
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,310
Jeez, mate, what are you?

271
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,531
Got me in this mess!

272
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,200
Honestly...

273
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,070
Mrs Zoha Aqil...

274
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,907
I like the sound of it.

275
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:14,133
Great. She's well-off, too.

276
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,210
You think we're so greedy?
-Can't I fool around with you?

277
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,090
Just call and ask her if she went there!

278
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,973
I ain't asking anything.

279
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:29,260
I told you there's no need to invite them here.

280
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,230
They didn't have a penny, but had the guts to say we're not their class! Sweet Jesus...

281
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,620
It's a way to refuse, Malika...

282
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,480
Besides, Munni's so simple and homely.

283
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,150
Everyone would like someone like you...

284
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,510
That's why I asked you to get Munni into university. She'll open her eyes. But no...

285
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,000
You'd rather be pure as the driven snow!

286
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,512
I think someone's poisoned their ears.
-To the dickens with them.

287
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:03,920
It's good we aren't marrying Munni off to him! Our Munni's perfect.

288
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,950
I'm sure, she'll find someone rolling in it!

289
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,813
Hopefully...

290
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,403
I'll go check.

291
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,994
Good afternoon.

292
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,839
Does Mr Aqil Ahmed live here?

293
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,259
Yes.

294
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm from Bike House Showroom. I've brought his sports bike.

295
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,106
Sports bike?

296
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,986
Who bought this?

297
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:37,476
Sorry but I can't tell you that. Please sign this receiving letter.

298
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:40,945
My men will park the bike in the compound.

299
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank you, ma'am.

300
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,789
Who was it?

301
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:04,658
Someone bought Aqil a sports bike.

302
00:21:04,658 --> 00:21:05,941
Good Lord...

303
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:07,895
It costs 1.4 million!

304
00:21:07,895 --> 00:21:08,871
What?

305
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:11,775
The showroom folks parked it in the compound.

306
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,806
But who -- ?

307
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:19,155
Someone he talks to all night behind closed doors, I'm sure!

308
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:21,134
Come, let's have a look!

309
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,810
C'mon, Munni!

310
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,372
Hey!

311
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,615
That's your cousin, innit?

312
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,123
Aye.

313
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,996
He's following in your footsteps, by the looks of it!
-Put a sock in it!

314
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,697
Let's get going.

315
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,138
Good afternoon.

316
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,213
Good afternoon.

317
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,695
Hello?

318
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,678
Yes, sir.

319
00:22:50,207 --> 00:22:52,332
I'll email you right away, sir.

320
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:53,560
Yeah.

321
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,514
Right away, sir.

322
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:07,273
C'mon, Asim. Give it a break. After all, it's your lunch break.

323
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:13,370
It was the purchase department. They asked me to email this right away. It's important.

324
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,070
Okay. Farah ordered what she wanted. I didn't know about you, so please order what you like.

325
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,740
Thank you very much. I'll have whatever you've ordered. It's fine by me.

326
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,790
Sometimes, it can be hard to guess what someone would like...

327
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,383
Innit, Sana?

328
00:23:31,383 --> 00:23:33,634
Please don't worry about me.

329
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:38,370
I'm the proverbial dervish type... I am thankful for whatever I get.

330
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,716
Of course.

331
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:45,240
Sana always tells me you're so nice and, yeah, the dervish type.

332
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,049
One should be humble.

333
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:53,298
Someone who's humble is the most satisfied person in the world.

334
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,450
Yes, Mr Farooq?

335
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,062
You haven't received it?

336
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:07,792
I sent it right away.

337
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,137
Alright, sir... I'm coming...

338
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,831
In a minute, sir. Okay.

339
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:17,480
What happened? Have your lunch...

340
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,241
Mr Farooq's been calling so many times. He needs some important data.

341
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:24,190
Some other day maybe?

342
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,777
I have to go. Thank you.

343
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:30,106
Okay, bye.
-Bye.

344
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,360
Just here for a sec. Don't close the door.

345
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,868
Malika!

346
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,484
Go in!

347
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,740
Quickly...

348
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,437
C'mon, Sana... You didn't say a word on the way?

349
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:48,967
How could I? I didn't get a chance. Mr Farooq was after him every other second.

350
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:54,480
He's such a weird guy... Can't he switch his phone off when we're going out?

351
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,370
How about you tell him that when we get back?

352
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,667
Lovely. You know I won't stay quiet.

353
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,359
Good luck with that...

354
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,118
Your parathas, ma'am...

355
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:08,210
Please send the bill.
-Your bill's been paid.

356
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,418
Who paid it?
-The man with you.

357
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,968
Good. Saves you some money. Relax.

358
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:21,995
But lunch was on me!

359
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,643
What's with that bike?
-They delivered it in the morning.

360
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:30,860
I asked who'd sent it.

361
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,980
But they didn't tell me.

362
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,420
All his friends are proper dossers! I saw one of them outside, too!

363
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,460
Enough!

364
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,676
No need to use your brain.

365
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,890
He doesn't realise he's wasting your time...

366
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,230
Understand the distance between you and Waqas, Aqil.

367
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:58,111
I'm not asking you to end your friendship, but think about your future.

368
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:04,091
They'd buy us with these gifts!

369
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,900
Waqas didn't give me this bike.

370
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,960
Who, then?
-Take it easy.

371
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,380
I'm ashamed to see how you think.

372
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,293
Don't make me regret coming home early.

373
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:25,472
You better know that I'm the only one who can get you out of this shack. I'm the only one who can get you into a palace.

374
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,701
We have a right to the riches you talk about. It's our money that makes them rich!

375
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:35,988
No self-respecting man builds himself on the money of others.

376
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:37,498
Just look at Asim...

377
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:42,520
So honest, self-respecting, hard-working...

378
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,030
He's built everything with his hard-earned money.

379
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,300
He cares for us all. His family, all of us...

380
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,308
I wish you'd follow in his footsteps.

381
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:04,416
Well, I've seen your saintlike Asim today...

382
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:07,894
I know what he's really like...

383
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,170
Christ knows when he'll see sense...

384
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,574
He's right.

385
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:21,040
Our money makes them rich.

386
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,640
The Lord's given them much more than they need.

387
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:30,926
And Christ knows when <i>you</i>'ll see sense...

388
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,984
Hi!

389
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:42,930
How're you doing?

390
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,530
I haven't heard from you in a while.

391
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm very thankful for what you've done.

392
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,755
You're still angry with me, Aqil?

393
00:30:56,705 --> 00:31:02,067
You're one of very few I can never be angry with.

394
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:06,010
But I don't think...

395
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,024
I deserve you.

396
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:13,055
The way you care for me...

397
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:17,461
It seems like you can feel what I wish for...

398
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,816
I don't think I deserve this love.

399
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:23,160
Please don't say that...

400
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,551
You deserve much more.

401
00:31:27,538 --> 00:31:32,880
Why are you embarrassed? You know I don't like it.

402
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,620
You were right...

403
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,480
When've you ever been right?

404
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,540
I don't deserve this gift...

405
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:46,352
I do like it very much,

406
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:49,470
But I can't accept it...

407
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,117
I'll send it back tomorrow. Bye.

408
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,207
What?

409
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:55,137
No -- Aqil!

410
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:56,953
Aqil?

411
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,240
Hey Mum! Ahh! Strawberries!

412
00:32:20,665 --> 00:32:23,299
Where've you been?

413
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:26,020
I asked you something.
-What happened?

414
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:31,810
Didn't I tell you it's very important that you go to office today? I needed your sign on these files!

415
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,552
I am so sorry...

416
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,815
I'll go tomorrow. I promise.

417
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:39,032
You're becoming very careless.

418
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:43,090
This business will shut down if you keep it up!

419
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,781
Mum...

420
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:50,740
I'm genuinely sorry. I won't do it again. I'll go tomorrow, I tell you.

421
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,480
And your friend! He's a ne'er-do-well. Corrupts you too.

422
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,350
For God's sake, just ask him to start doing something.

423
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,240
Know what, he's looking for a job. I told him to come to my office, but he said it'll affect our friendship.

424
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,020
Don't even think of letting that sort of dossers near your office.
-Mum...

425
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,811
He's very good.

426
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:14,515
He's a nice guy. You'll realise if you talked to him!

427
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,605
Acta, non verba, my dear!

428
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:26,459
Well, to change your life, you need to work. And to get work, you need skills. And your friend's got none.

429
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:31,383
Go over this file and sign it.

430
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,548
Can I?
-Yes.

431
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:37,393
And I want it right now.

432
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,233
Hey, Aunt.

433
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,631
Aqil! That can't be! Am I dreaming?

434
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:50,940
You're embarrassing me...

435
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,108
I was just kidding. Please, sit.

436
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,398
Isn't Asim here?

437
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,642
He'd be on his way. Must've stopped to pray.

438
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,103
Sit. I'll get you a cuppa.

439
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:07,013
Aunt...

440
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,394
Is he...

441
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:13,460
Always so late, or is it just today?

442
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,189
You know about the traffic. It gets late sometimes...

443
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,280
Your son's too upright, Aunt.

444
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,029
Keep an eye on him.

445
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:29,737
I'd hate to see him led astray.

446
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:33,360
My son's as wise as he's upright.

447
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,290
May the Lord protect him.

448
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,765
And look who we have here! Hello, m'dear.
-Hello, Mum.

449
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:46,340
Hey there, Aqil! What a pleasant surprise! This is quite the occasion.
-Indeed it is!

450
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:51,283
Alright, I'll get you a cuppa. Sit.
-No, Aunt -- I'm in a bit of a hurry.

451
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:54,220
I had to talk about something to Asim.

452
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,549
What happened? Everything alright?

453
00:34:56,549 --> 00:34:59,230
So far, aye...

454
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,691
Come with me? We need to talk.

455
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:06,559
Sit down and talk. I'll go get you a cuppa.

456
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,370
C'mon, grab a pew.

457
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,725
Why are you so nervous?

458
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:26,169
Why'd I be?

459
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:33,750
You're my Aunt's only son, Asim.

460
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,019
Mum loves you so much too.

461
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,092
Yeah, she does...

462
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:49,354
We're also related in another way. I hope you remember that.

463
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,262
You're my brother-in-law to-be.

464
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:01,420
Yeah. You don't need to remind me.

465
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,000
I saw you with someone, Asim.

466
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
