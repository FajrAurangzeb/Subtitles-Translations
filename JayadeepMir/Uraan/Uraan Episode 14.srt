1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I come here to forget all my worries.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather leave than hear any of that.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do that.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what I'd do without you.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Just relax.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just a bit tensed these days...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I had a go at you.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now... Why are you so tensed? Tell me.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoha...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my sister...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her engagement's almost broken...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't arrange for her wedding!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can help.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All that's mine is yours, too. You know that.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can arrange for your sister's wedding.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to test me?
-I'm not.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to get you out of this worry.
-No.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anything from you.
-Cheque or cash?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's 200,000. I'll arrange for more by tomorrow.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-It's not for you. It's for your sister. It's her wedding.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil... Please...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim... I wanted to talk about something...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please forget everything Sana said.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just mean -- You think she's not the right type -- Always looking for excuses to get your attention...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miss Farah...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't talk to me about it again. I don't like it.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you always think about yourself?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her family's going through hard times. That's why she works here.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's going to leave the job. Please, try to understand!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's it such a big deal?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zo -- Zoha... It's Aqil...

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Why are you so worried?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- Just a few steps from your place -- I -- Some robbers -- Took my bike, the cash at gunpoint -- Everything!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you alright?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ye -- Yeah... I'm fine, but -- They took everything!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me where you are. I'm coming to get you.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send you my location.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Just wait for me.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me here?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. I don't see you around these days. What's up, mate?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me you're still grieving over her!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just felt a bit down...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure I'll be fine after talking to you, Atif.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How will you move on if you keep thinking about her?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know about the girls these days... In and out of your life when they want. I'm sure you'll find many others. Don't worry.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yeah, get some air.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also... Movie night with me tonight?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you, then.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God you're safe.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to fight back, Zoha, but --
-Are you crazy? You should've given them what they wanted quietly.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea what could've happened.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's already happened.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost everything.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm happy you're safe... What if something happened to you?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything could've happened.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess what, no one came to help me!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody risks his life for anyone.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Zoha...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bike you gave -- The cash -- I lost all of it...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get it all back, Aqil.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anything from you. That's it.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I'm always there for you.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd care for you if not me?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.
-Blimey, Mum, so late!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, we'd gone shopping. Keep it here, and get me some tea, will you? I'm honestly knackered!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even imagine what you'd do when it's time for the wedding.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my son's engagement! I'm very delighted. You're gonna love this ring if you saw it! It's so beautiful!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Novera likes it, right? You should've let me pick the ring if you cared about my choice.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you're cross already!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I'm fine.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you want to take her shopping?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what? You're done now, I mean...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wanted to go shopping, but doesn't know her way around here. I just thought I'd go with her.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could do that... I've been born here, I know my way around town.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you getting jealous of your Mum?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

101
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,458
I got a feeling Novera thinks I'm immature.

102
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,140
Who told you you're one bit mature?
-Mum!

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Sup, where are you?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Home?

106
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:36,948
Come out quick. Got a surprise for you.

107
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:42,508
Surprise? What've you got?
-I can't it to you in there, guv!

108
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,578
'Guv'?

109
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:45,968
You coming?

110
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,469
Okie doke...

111
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:48,959
Lemme guess. Aqil.

112
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,189
Yeah.

113
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,280
You wouldn't have such friends if you were mature.

114
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,532
Jeez, Mum...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it th -- Whoa! Blimey, man!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is awesome!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks brand new! Mme. Zoha gave it to you, right? Innit?

119
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:22,494
This bike's just fantastic, bro!
-Your bro's fantastic! Remember that!

120
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,994
Aye, El Fantastico!

121
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:28,193
Start it, will you?
-Here. I'll show you.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ready?
-Yeah!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanna try?
-Of course!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your turn!

125
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,511
Gorblimey if I could find one thing kept properly here... His room's a thorough mess!

126
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,801
No idea what he's gonna do...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd he...?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you get this?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's mine.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've borrowed some money for Malika's wedding.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who gives you so much money?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm dead tired, Mum. Not in the mood for an interrogation.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni told me you've got a costly phone. And what about that sports bike down there?

137
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:14,283
Jesus, anyone else in your place would've hugged her son. Blessed him, prayed that he got more. But you! You're grilling me!

138
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:31,409
I'd hug you, bless you, and pray for your success the day you earned a single penny you deserved, even if you had to spend it! But don't you dare bring of your 'gifts' here!

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like your Dad...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd always come to me before going to work. For my blessings.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I remember, Granny.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I should get going.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope Sana's coming to work today?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know where she lives, right? You'd dropped her home once.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. Why are you asking that?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma and I want to meet her.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? After all, if she could come here...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't come here. Mum invited her here.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the same to me.
-But -- Granny...

153
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:29,546
I don't want her to get so close to you.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can stay here if you like. We're going.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going anywhere.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay if you don't care about me. But just think of your Mum! What about her wishes? Her dreams, her plans for you?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always wanted to make Malika her daughter-in-law.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget Malika.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never cared about you. Do you really think she'd care about your Mum?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look... Sana's very nice. I want that your wife should respect you, respect your family...

162
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:17,685
No idea how you could even imagine that! Seriously!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think about it. We've lost all hope from Malika.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we should give Malika some time.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think it's you who needs time. Not Malika.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Malika would think over it again...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'm getting late. I'll be back in the evening.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.
-Bye, take care.

171
00:13:52,952 --> 00:13:55,282
Show him the way, O Lord...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're out of oil, Mum. Just got enough for today. 5 kg?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We just got it two days back! Can't believe we used all of it! Everything seems to be going to waste!

174
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,189
Well... No surprise, really. Not when no one knows where all the money's coming from!

175
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:18,263
Don't even start...

176
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,333
I told you everything.

177
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:26,473
What are you looking at? Just thank God we're getting something!

178
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:32,003
I'd rather be thankful I don't have to depend on you two!

179
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:37,374
Blimey, you must be the only Mum in the world who hates everything about her kids.

180
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:40,994
What's up with you? Picking a fight first thing in the morning.

181
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:45,356
Don't expect me to be all cheery if that's what I hear first thing in the morning!

182
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:48,356
I didn't say anything to you, Malika.

183
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:53,227
I wonder if that's a hint of guilt I hear in your voice...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum...

185
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,490
I asked Aqil where he got the bike, the phone, and all the money from...

186
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,070
Didn't he tell you?

187
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,360
Do you really think he'd tell me about whatever it is he's into?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else do we need?
-A packet of Surf.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Hi!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a surprise!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How come Waqas ain't here?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think Waqas is always with me?
-He ought to be if he isn't! I mean, he's got such a lovely cousin...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for the compliment. He was busy at the office. I thought I'd rather not disturb him.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea or coffee? I'm not takin' a no. What'd he think if he heard that I didn't even ask you?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure Waqas won't mind?
-I'm 100% sure. He's an old friend, I know him.

197
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:56,445
Lemme get you tea.

198
00:15:56,445 --> 00:15:58,116
Après vous!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

201
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:22,179
Be done with it quick. But remember that after this I'm not seeing you or taking your call, like ever! And don't you even dare threaten to come knocking!

202
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,510
You'll be knocked for six after what my brother would do to you!

203
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,880
What are you looking at?

204
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,251
Just say it and be done with it!

205
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,721
I think Mum's right, after all...

206
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:38,583
What?

207
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:47,518
She said that if I saw you again, I may grow to hate you so much that I'd laugh at my love.

208
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,094
Okaaaay...

209
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,924
Feelin' the hate growin'? About chuffing time!

210
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,040
Good riddance! Bye!

211
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,851
Why'd you do that?

212
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:06,632
I did it? C'mon, you can't be serious!

213
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:06,637
This love was rooted in a lie, and the truth's out now.

214
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,268
Malika...

215
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,178
Doesn't true love mean anything to you?

216
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:14,567
You can't get by on love, Noriyan!

217
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:22,567
But it's enough for our souls to get by, isn't it?
-Sweet Jesus... Sounds hollow, coming from you!

218
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:27,808
You'd punish me so harshly for one lie?
-Oh really!

219
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:34,767
What do you know about punishment? I'm being punished for trusting you, loving you!

220
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,157
You've shattered all my dreams!

221
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:42,158
No dreams matter more than love!
-That's where you're wrong.

222
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:46,358
My dreams matter to me much more.

223
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:50,768
Well, if you're done, I guess I should get going.

224
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:55,408
Why are you asking me?

225
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,730
You're already gone from my life.

226
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,699
Do me a favour, will you?

227
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:14,254
If you ever feel that love matters even one bit...

228
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:17,051
Just call out to me.

229
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,143
Don't keep yourself waiting.

230
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:29,076
I'm never gonna call out to you.

231
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,963
So, what do you do?

232
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:45,704
Something really important.

233
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,694
What'd that be?

234
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,843
Lookin' for a job. I'm an MBA.

235
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:56,113
Yeah, I understand unemployment's a big problem... But I guess it's the same as anywhere?

236
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,143
Nah, it ain't a big problem.

237
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:03,443
You get a lot of jobs here. But not the one you like.

238
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:07,314
What kind of job do you want?
-One that makes me independent.

239
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:15,173
I've got a simple formula. My life, my rules. Their lives, their rules.

240
00:19:15,974 --> 00:19:17,174
Wow...

241
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:18,744
That's tidy.

242
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:23,775
Tell Waqas sometime. He doesn't seem to get it.

243
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,760
Really?

244
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,725
I thought he's very broad-minded.

245
00:19:27,725 --> 00:19:31,965
Mulish is more like it.

246
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:34,965
Mu-lish... Hmm...

247
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:39,155
I can talk to him if there's any problem. We see each other at the gym everyday.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The thing is, he wants to marry me.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I just asked him for some time so I can get to know him better...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't know why he's in a rush.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's going too fast, and I can't figure out why.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not his fault if you ask me.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, he's got a cousin like you. I don't see why he shouldn't be in a hurry to marry you.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves you so much.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe in love that doesn't care about what you think.

256
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,422
Blimey!

257
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,671
You think just like me! I mean --

258
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:35,962
I believe there's a difference between love and ownership. You should let the one you love live their life their way. Innit?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, how 'bout some snacks? I don't really like the idea of just having tea. What'd Waqas think? Hey!
-Okay...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feelin' the hate growin'? About chuffing time!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good riddance! Bye!

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't keep yourself waiting.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never gonna call out to you.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

266
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,907
Hello. You're back early.

267
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:27,406
Mitching today...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you go then?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to see if you were right...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd see that two-timer...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn my love into hate...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right. She doesn't deserve my love.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take my hand. Bridge the gap.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing I can't get you. You can live out all your dreams.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gone with Rashida to the doctor.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She took Munni because no one else was around.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one goes here, okay?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you thought about her, Mum?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Work on this.

286
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,494
Who cares about what I've decided?

287
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:36,984
Nobody bothers about what I say!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Malika. You getting her married or not?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're her brother. What've you thought about her?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gave her a chance. It was no good.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one way out now, Mum.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and ask Aunt to take her.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma never refused!

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sister did!

295
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,520
That boofhead!

296
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,202
She's out of options now.

297
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:15,652
I'm sure she won't refuse now.

298
00:26:36,436 --> 00:26:40,156
Good to see you're back.

299
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:50,135
I'm sorry for bothering you...

300
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:56,855
Yeah... It bothered me a lot that you decided to quit the job over this trifle.

301
00:26:56,855 --> 00:27:03,465
You were right... We're colleagues. Just colleagues.

302
00:27:03,465 --> 00:27:06,995
I should not have hoped for anything else.

303
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,696
Miss Sana...

304
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,753
I'm not gonna lie to you...

305
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:22,243
My mother's honest-to-goodness.

306
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:28,533
I don't want you to get so close to her that it causes problems for me.

307
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:32,564
I hope you understand.

308
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,256
I do.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll give it to Mr Sohail.

310
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,609
What'd he say?

311
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,537
Reminded me my limits...

312
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:28,851
Just one photoshoot. That's all it takes to change your fate.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be allowed to.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you need to ask?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Family or someone else?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you're so lovely... You must have a boyfriend.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or a lover whose happiness means the world to you.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, right.

319
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:04,707
Looking at you, I diagnose you with... Heartbreak!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heartbreak, you say?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been deserted on the first step.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's upset with me.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks I was this rich guy...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, that...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love doesn't really care about it... But there's always a few gold diggers...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They just want their independence, all that money... You can't help it...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Malika was not like that! She knows I love her so much!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you seriously think she still feels that way?
-Of course, Atif! I love her so much, and I'm sure she'd love me someday!

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just angry with me.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All the best.

334
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,644
Malika, my dear...

335
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:44,605
If it's your love for your Romeo that's stopping you, allow me to sort it out for you...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you not coming to university?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no looking back!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and Noriyan have broken up. They're all talking about it here.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've sorted things out. Did you guys have to make it public?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who made it public?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a few pictures going viral. Is it you or Noriyan?
-What?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What pictures?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you know about your pics with Noriyan going viral?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check your WhatsApp, I'll show you.

347
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:26,054
Yeah, send me, double time!

348
00:32:39,019 --> 00:32:41,672
Oh my God!

349
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:45,671
Jesus, Noriyan!

350
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:50,534
Hello?

351
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:53,685
How can you be so low?

352
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,776
What happened, Malika?
-What do you think?

353
00:32:56,776 --> 00:33:01,367
You're settling scores by making these pics go viral?

354
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:04,776
You don't know what I can do to you!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What pictures are you talking about, Malika? What happened? What do you mean?

356
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:13,237
That officially does it!

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for being with me all this time, Shakila. I can't turn you down. Not when it's Zeba's wedding gown. You'll get it.

358
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:41,423
I remember the day you started this, Zahida... With just one sewing machine...

359
00:33:41,423 --> 00:33:45,562
And look where it's got you now! Bless you!

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so happy for you. My kids look up to you.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, I almost forgot...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw some pictures of Malika on the internet... With a boy!

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of pictures?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zeba told me she saw some pictures of Malika with him on the internet.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told her they probably study together. Someone must've clicked some pictures in the class or on a field trip and shared them. But they think they're going out together!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen so much that I just can't know what's right. I even asked Zeba to stay out of it.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll get going. I'll need these two weeks from now. Bye.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Malika?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Aunt Shakila just say?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shakila said she saw some pictures of you with someone on the internet.

373
00:35:01,124 --> 00:35:07,765
Just -- some pictures from a field trip -- and some extracurricular activities...

374
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:12,825
I know Noriyan's done it! He -- He wants to shame me!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Aqil!

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be?

379
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:34,593
Just chill, bro. Relax.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who had these pictures?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I clicked them and I only shared them with Malika!

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, everyone wants to talk to me.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to me.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Switch it off.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If no one else had these pics, Noriyan, I'm sure no one else could've done it.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? I leaked these pics myself?
-Not you! But Malika?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What rubbish! Why'd she even --?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, he's with me.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had him switch his phone off.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was Naveed. He was worried why your phone was off.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
