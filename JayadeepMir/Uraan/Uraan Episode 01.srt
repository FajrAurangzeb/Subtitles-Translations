Your Majesty! His Honour hath summon'd the condemned.

18
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,710
Pray reconsider thy decision, Your Majesty.

19
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:19,661
Thou hast no shortage of devoted slaves who would

20
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:29,820
Take thy crime 'pon himself and, with gladness, ascend the gallows.

21
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:37,090
I have always seen Your Majesty stand for Justice.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,019
For probity, my love I'd have to cede...

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,734
O Lord! Never could I have conceiv'd...

24
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,510
Your Majesty...

25
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,380
So blinded by thy love I cannot be

26
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:08,244
To do what would in my subjects' eyes disgrace me...

27
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,815
Your Majesty...

28
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,483
Thy love shall always make me proud...

29
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,924
She texted, Mum... She's coming.

30
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:35,950
I told her not to take part if it'll get late.

31
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,814
She leaves us all worried!

32
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,238
Munni...

33
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,398
Get my cloak.

34
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,804
Where are you going?

35
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,744
I thought...

36
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,523
I'd go check.

37
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:56,020
The bus would leave her at the stop. It's so dark. I'll get her.

38
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,110
Why are you so worried? She'll be on her way.

39
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,950
Thank goodness Aqil isn't back yet!

40
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,070
If he found out Her Majesty isn't back yet, I tell you!

41
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,330
Go and get my cloak, Munni.

42
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,690
Tell me, Mum...

43
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,933
Has he ever been back on time?

44
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:19,640
Enough talk. I asked you to get my cloak.

45
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,800
Alrighty...

46
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,058
Good Lord, what's up with her...

47
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,561
She's such a bother...

48
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:33,043
I get so worried...

49
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,060
What's up, Your Majesty?

50
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,093
Happy the play ended before your punishment?

51
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:42,134
Did you see them praise us, Noriyan?

52
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,701
I had no idea they'd laud us so much!

53
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:47,620
Did you see their reaction? It was phenomenal!

54
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,500
I mean -- They actually felt that you were about to be punished!

55
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,498
And...

56
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:59,190
So did I, for a moment... I felt that I was being separated from you forever...

57
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,770
Indeed! I could see the fear, the grief in your expressions!

58
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,930
That's what I was thinking when I did that.

59
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,400
How I'd feel if we were separated forever...

60
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,590
Really... It felt like...

61
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,166
It might just kill me...

62
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,600
Your Majesty...

63
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,660
Reality check!

64
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,160
No one can separate us!

65
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,926
Jeez, Malika...

66
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,633
As if I'd let anyone!

67
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,418
Blimey, Noriyan, I'm so late...

68
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:32,150
What's the hurry, Malika?

69
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,974
'What's the hurry'? Go and change!

70
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:39,200
After you.
-Don't worry about me. Go!

71
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,890
I'm good as dead today...

72
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,976
It's so late...

73
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,361
Hello, Aunt.
-Hello there, m'boy.

74
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,122
Great that you're here.

75
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:56,348
Could you get Malika from the bus stop? Her bus would be there any moment.

76
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,317
Where's Malika been?

77
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:02,460
Her university group had put up a play.

78
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,931
Alright. Don't worry. I'll get her.

79
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,328
Wanna have something?
-An earful, please!

80
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:38,980
What do you mean?

81
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,433
I'm late, Noriyan. Mum'll give me an earful!

82
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:45,296
Just another day at the office for you! What's the big deal?

83
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:50,810
You don't know how angry she'll be! I almost couldn't convince her to let me perform!

84
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,346
I even told her it's an all-girls event... The actors and the audience!

85
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,679
Whoa, you're quite the bluff master...

86
00:07:57,679 --> 00:08:05,899
I had to! To fulfil my dream that people admire me, clap for me!

87
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,709
And that you confess your love for me before everyone!

88
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:13,019
I don't need to bluff for that!
-Aye, but to proclaim it to the world!

89
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,620
I did today!

90
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,966
That wasn't you.

91
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,490
That was King Arthur's dearest Guinevere!

92
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,236
Who could be the king of this Guinevere's heart...

93
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:26,154
...But the one and only Noriyan Ali?

94
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:31,120
You better be ready to tell your family with the same confidence!

95
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,958
I will, but please drop me home!

96
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,716
Okay. We're on our way. We had some proper fun today, mate.

97
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:41,080
Yeah. And... This car!

98
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,031
Woo hoo!

99
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,109
Didn't you go?

100
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:57,155
I saw Asim. He's gone to pick her up.

101
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,720
Mum...

102
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,815
You're right.

103
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:05,160
God always sends Asim to help us.

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,370
Yes...

105
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,980
He's such a lovely lad...

106
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,310
May the Lord bless him.

107
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,370
I didn't even ask him where he was going.

108
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,610
Just sent him to pick Malika up.

109
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,105
Just pray she comes back with Asim.

110
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,246
Just drop me around that corner.

111
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:50,330
Let me drop you at your doorstep. I won't come inside.
-No! I can walk! Just drop me here.

112
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,460
Jeez, mate...
-Stop already!

113
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,186
Alright, as Your Majesty wishes. Can't say no.

114
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,819
You've got your whole life to have it your way.

115
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:02,810
I think I'll be done with this life before that happens.

116
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,520
Oh, please... I'm late! Bye! See you!

117
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,835
Hello...

118
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,788
Hey!

119
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:42,659
Goodness, you're so late! You said it'll be over by 8.

120
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:45,821
Blimey, Mum... Trying me the moment I've stepped inside!

121
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:49,160
It gets late in these kinds of functions.

122
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,530
Your phone was off too! You could've kept that on.

123
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,118
You have to switch it off to enter, and -- I forgot to switch it on...

124
00:10:57,118 --> 00:11:04,086
If only you felt that your Mum's worried, waiting for you...

125
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:06,800
Alright, how was your play?

126
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,580
Splendid! They praised us so much... Clapped for me so much! You can't imagine!

127
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,094
But...

128
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:16,764
Where's Asim?

129
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,952
Isn't he coming in?

130
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,110
Asim?

131
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,426
Yes. He'd gone to pick you up.

132
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,530
Didn't you see him?

133
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,696
No?

134
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,822
He would've passed right by you and you wouldn't have seen him!

135
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:31,682
Munni...

136
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:34,912
Call him. The poor lad would be at the bus stop.

137
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,533
Okay.

138
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,310
Hello?

139
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,320
Yes, Munni?

140
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,851
What?

141
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,420
She's back?

142
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,870
But I'm at the bus stop...

143
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,181
I didn't see her...

144
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:09,931
Alright, I'm coming.

145
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,163
You've got to show me today's pictures!

146
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,491
Sit down!

147
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,666
Here!

148
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,860
You look so lovely!

149
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,071
You could've taken me along... I would've loved to watch everything!

150
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:37,152
I was already getting late...
-Hello.

151
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,243
Hello, Asim.

152
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:40,792
Hello there, m'lad.

153
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:45,632
She showed up after you went to pick her up. Didn't you see each other?

154
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:50,026
My class fellow dropped me here. She was driving.

155
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:55,650
And your innocent lad Asim hasn't got an eye for the ladies!

156
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,210
Bless him. May the Lord give everyone such a dutiful child.

157
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,740
I get so worried...

158
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,701
No girl should be out -- so late...

159
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,776
Splendid...

160
00:13:06,776 --> 00:13:13,200
You get worried about your daughters... How about an ounce of that worry for your son who isn't back before 3 a.m.?

161
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,157
Malika...

162
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:15,938
Please.

163
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:18,948
I worry for him, too.

164
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:22,748
But I'm helpless.

165
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:27,539
I'll get some tea for Malika. Have some before you leave.
-Alright.

166
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,406
Did you have to say that about Aqil?

167
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:35,100
You know he doesn't listen to her.

168
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,586
Wrong number. Go and boss over those who don't listen.

169
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:39,846
Asim!

170
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:43,847
Look at Malika play the Empress!

171
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,548
No other role would suit her. [Malika = Empress]

172
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:48,330
What's with the hot water in this?

173
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,920
At least keep some cold water here...
-I'll get you some.

174
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:56,421
Janey Mac, Malika...

175
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,996
Do you have to be angry every moment?

176
00:13:58,996 --> 00:14:04,687
Don't even think about any romance while Munni's away.

177
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,349
Malika... Aunt was worried...

178
00:14:07,349 --> 00:14:11,504
About how you'd come back from the bus stop alone.

179
00:14:11,504 --> 00:14:12,830
It was late.

180
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,589
Thanks to you and her. Happy?

181
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,326
Aunt wanted that your ride home be ready the moment you got off from the bus.

182
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,432
Did you just call your clunker a ride?

183
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,648
I know that my clunker doesn't suit my queen, Malika...

184
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:40,458
I told you not to act like I'm yours!

185
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:45,097
We're just cousins. Get it?

186
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,450
'Sup, mate!

187
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,756
How's it going? How was your performance?

188
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:50,980
I've never experienced anything like it, Atif!

189
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,080
The curtain was raised and there was the audience, right there! And I had a sword!

190
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,260
You should've been there, mate!

191
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,540
I would've told everyone - 'This is Atif, my brother'!

192
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,796
Everyone would've been green with envy! I'd be so proud...

193
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:12,158
I told you we're shooting these days. No time at all...

194
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:16,950
But it's good you're taking part in every play your university folks put up.

195
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,690
It'll build confidence and give you valuable experience. Keep it up!

196
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,370
I'm just following my passion, Atif.

197
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,683
Ain't it wonderful if passion builds perfection?

198
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:30,440
Anyway, you need to watch my performance.

199
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,526
I've learnt everything from you, after all!

200
00:16:32,526 --> 00:16:33,770
Learnt acting from me?

201
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,255
Confidence, Atif. Confidence!

202
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:40,650
Aye. Anyway, I'm starving. Coming with me?

203
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,656
In a while...

204
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,790
Good evening.
-Good evening.

205
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,736
I'm literally starving. What've you got today?

206
00:17:04,736 --> 00:17:06,466
Pasta.

207
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:08,050
Oh, nice!

208
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,596
What's up with Noriyan? He seems happy as Larry.

209
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,246
Please don't give him your car for so long.

210
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,350
He left in the morning and came back just now.

211
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,296
It's no big deal.

212
00:17:18,296 --> 00:17:19,946
It is.

213
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:24,930
You can't stand getting jostled about in buses when you get used to riding cars.

214
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,146
Why do you think so much about any of this?

215
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:33,766
You've got to, when nothing seems to go right...

216
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:36,206
Anyway, I'll go and change. Then, we'll have dinner.

217
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,886
I'll get your dinner in five minutes.

218
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:39,556
Ayesha!

219
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,550
Here, take this.

220
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,450
Alright, buddy, let's go.

221
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,285
Seriously?

222
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:27,051
Knackered in 90 minutes?

223
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,881
It's been much more than 90 minutes.

224
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,121
Well, go on if you want. I'll get going.

225
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,641
How about you go back on your own?

226
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,500
Jeez...

227
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,386
Hey! Wait!

228
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,567
You snooty blighter!

229
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,798
Stuck-up because of your status, eh?

230
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,490
At least it makes you come running!

231
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,551
You know me inside out!

232
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,835
You'd be at the gym all day if I didn't play driver.

233
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:05,360
Fair enough!

234
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,051
So it's my job to play your taxi!

235
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,566
Hello there!

236
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:13,536
Juliet's calling!

237
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,170
♪ <i>You're here, your eyes are looking into mine, so baby, make me fly...</i> ♪

238
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,110
Please talk to her. She's been calling you for so long!
-Blimey...

239
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,956
I've told her not to bother me when I'm at the gym...

240
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,786
She can be such a bother...

241
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,480
Mummy's more like it.

242
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,610
Oh, please...

243
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,376
Tell her again. Talk to her. Please.

244
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:53,850
Hello...

245
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,956
I was just thinking of you...

246
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:59,032
Thinking of me or talking about me?

247
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,380
Thinking of you and talking about you...

248
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,386
One and the same.

249
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,736
Not quite.

250
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:11,966
Unless you're talking about me because you're thinking of me.

251
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:15,116
I was thinking of you and talking about you.

252
00:20:15,116 --> 00:20:21,830
Well, then, didn't you think of your promise to teach me new meditation poses?

253
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,326
Oh...

254
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:27,266
Sorry... I forgot entirely!

255
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,267
So, coming today?

256
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:33,720
No...

257
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,601
I'm very tired, Zoha.

258
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,566
See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

259
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,596
Get some rest.

260
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:40,860
See you tomorrow.

261
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,346
Thanks.

262
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,976
You understand me so well.

263
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,766
Bye.

264
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:48,416
Bye.

265
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,976
Way to go, tough guy!

266
00:20:54,976 --> 00:20:57,923
How flattering!

267
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,367
Ain't no flattery.

268
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:04,473
She really looks after me.

269
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:09,480
Besides, at her age, she should worry about God. Not any of this.

270
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,101
No way.

271
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,760
She ain't that old either.

272
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,700
The two of you are really made for each other.

273
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,868
Oh, seriously!

274
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:22,952
You know I don't like to hear that. C'mon.

275
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,182
Done?
-Yes.

276
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,166
Well done.

277
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,456
This is perfect.

278
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:38,807
Alright, you may go. Finish it tomorrow.

279
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,257
Good night.

280
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,276
Good night.

281
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:47,630
Can anybody 'round here fix this button here?

282
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,646
I'll do it in a while.

283
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:52,759
Leave it be. I'll do it myself.

284
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,989
Munni's better than you. Studies hard and helps me, too!

285
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:03,020
Of course. She loves stitching, just like you. I don't.

286
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,680
Have some shame, Malika.

287
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,340
It's no picnic.

288
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,976
But I have no option.

289
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:11,700
Forget her, Mum.

290
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,510
I'll do it.

291
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,310
You never let go of a chance to score brownie points, do you?

292
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,806
If it isn't your dearest!

293
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:28,286
Alright, Munni, fix this button...

294
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,727
I'll prepare dinner.

295
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,017
He would've had dinner.

296
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,180
Heya, Mum.

297
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,836
Hello...

298
00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:37,840
Waqas said hi.

299
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,646
Bless him.

300
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:43,597
Why must he?

301
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:45,677
It isn't something you 'must'.

302
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:49,858
You send greetings so you can get blessings.

303
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,456
He never bothered to show up. Just sends his greetings.

304
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,790
Should I bring him here to meet Mum?

305
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,526
Why not?

306
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:03,276
Don't you loll about his place all day?

307
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:05,906
You haven't seen his place.

308
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,196
People can get lost in that mansion.

309
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:13,907
I'd invite him to this ramshackle shanty, Mum...

310
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:19,749
Where we've got these scruffy curtains to hide the grotty doors and creaky windows... Oh, please!

311
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,636
Just -- Leave it.

312
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:29,146
Fix the button... I'll get you dinner.
-I've had dinner with Waqas.

313
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,460
Told you.

314
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,160
He gets to loaf about all day...

315
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,076
And of all the people in the world, you've got Asim for me.

316
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:43,386
How many times have I told you not to talk about Asim like that?

317
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:48,997
Please, Mum, stop hoping I'd ever say a single good word about him.

318
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,561
Munni...

319
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:54,532
Fix the button. I'm going to the kitchen.

320
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,880
Gently, Zahir...

321
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,870
Thank God it'll be off tomorrow.

322
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:32,990
Why do we need a trainer when I've got a physiotherapist?
-He's just coming to see you. He'll talk about a few things. That's it. See him.

323
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,100
I don't want to see anyone.
-Stop behaving like a kid, Zoha.

324
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,990
You need one. Doctor's orders.

325
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,750
Hello?

326
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,755
Hey!

327
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:25,461
I hope I'm not bothering you.

328
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,076
Obviously...

329
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,336
Look at the time.

330
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:32,879
Forget the time, look at the weather!

331
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,267
What happened?

332
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:39,466
It's raining! It's looking gorgeous, Aqil.

333
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,816
Okay...

334
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,906
Enjoy the rain. Cheers.

335
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:51,500
Just filthy puddles for me here.

336
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:58,600
Honestly, I love the rains only when I'm over there.

337
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,981
Then come over.

338
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,766
Sorry, but...

339
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,766
I can't come right now.

340
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,026
How about...

341
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:16,696
You imagine I'm with you in the rains and enjoy?

342
00:26:16,696 --> 00:26:18,487
Okay...

343
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,216
Alright, listen...

344
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,996
Yes?

345
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:26,087
I love you.

346
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:27,557
Bye.

347
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,053
Got a class today?

348
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:57,770
Yes.

349
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:01,913
You'll ask for a car again?

350
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,442
I don't need to ask bro.

351
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:06,752
He's not your brother.

352
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:11,491
He's the master of this house, and us. We're his servants.

353
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,990
That's the limit.

354
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:19,360
Always asking for something... Cars, clothes, boots, and...

355
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,010
Look at what you've got yesterday...
-Mum...

356
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,381
Only the Lord is our Master.

357
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,791
He thinks of me as his little brother.

358
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:31,412
Who gets these comforts in a servant's quarters?

359
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:34,675
Besides, he's given everything.

360
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:36,132
I don't ask him.

361
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:42,410
Comforts don't make a servant's quarters into a palace.

362
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,426
What's up with you?

363
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:48,110
If he gives you all of this, just turn him down!

364
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,676
Is this what I've taught you?

365
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:54,857
He's got three cars, Mum. So what if he gives me one?

366
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:57,600
As if you'd be a beggar without it!

367
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,357
It's his love, Mum...

368
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:02,748
Why does he love you?

369
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,619
Tell me. Why?

370
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,306
Because you've looked after his parents all those years.

371
00:28:09,306 --> 00:28:14,757
Atif was so busy with his job in advertising that he just didn't get the time.

372
00:28:14,757 --> 00:28:18,979
You ran everything here.

373
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:31,588
Madame and Monsieur had but one complaint till their last breath...

374
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:34,759
That their son's got no time for them.

375
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:39,850
Wealthy people have everything, Mum...

376
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,916
Except time.

377
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:51,057
Because they know what will happen to their business if they wasted any time on emotional matters.

378
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:56,013
And how would they earn anything if their business shut down?

379
00:28:56,013 --> 00:29:02,947
They know that money is power. Money buys respect.

380
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:07,143
Just pray that I become a great businessman like Atif!

381
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:08,558
And earn a lot!

382
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,659
God forbid!

383
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,070
What do you mean, Mum?

384
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:17,180
So that when I'm old,

385
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,500
Sick, and on my deathbed,

386
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,161
You don't have time for me either?

387
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,061
Mum...

388
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
How did you even think of that?

389
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:34,605
I can sacrifice my life for you.

390
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,396
Mum...

391
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,215
Aqil...

392
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:19,351
Going somewhere?

393
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,031
Yes.

394
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:24,031
Don't ask where.

395
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:25,463
No.

396
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:29,372
I stopped asking you long ago.

397
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:32,707
We need to talk.

398
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,057
Yeah?

399
00:30:34,057 --> 00:30:38,900
Your friend Waqas has got a flourishing business.

400
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,696
Can't he give you a job?

401
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:48,575
What's up with you, Mum?

402
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:51,406
He's my friend. He loves me so much!

403
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:54,120
I'd go to him asking for a job!

404
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,256
Fair enough...

405
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:56,995
He loves you...

406
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:59,458
...So much he can't give you a job?

407
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,458
That doesn't mean I start working for him.

408
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:08,139
There's a respect for friends, a --
-That you'd lose if you asked for a job? That it?

409
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:14,900
You hardly lose your respect when you ride his car, wear his clothes, and enjoy dinner when he pays!

410
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Let me tell you!
-Aqil!

411
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,400
Ask her to get out of my sights, or I'll clobber her for real!

412
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,030
Back to your room.

413
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,406
I'm very worried because of you, Aqil.

414
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,050
Come here.

415
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:43,050
Here. Sit down.
-Where are you taking me?

416
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,690
So, why are you worried?

417
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,206
So you think there's nothing to get worried about?

418
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,526
Everything will be alright, Mum.

419
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:56,576
Don't worry.

420
00:31:56,576 --> 00:32:02,186
If only problems could be solved by not worrying about them...

421
00:32:02,615 --> 00:32:07,456
As if my worrying about them will solve them!
-What are you doing?

422
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:11,186
Be happy. I'm going. Bye!
-Aqil!

423
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:15,433
He won't change...

424
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,216
Alright, you may go.

425
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,246
Hey, Atif! Good morning!

426
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:28,307
'Morning.

427
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,936
Here.

428
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:34,280
Keys, Atif?

429
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,076
Don't you always take them?

430
00:32:37,076 --> 00:32:41,566
Please don't embarrass me by saying that...

431
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:46,426
I didn't mean it that way. Take it easy.

432
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:49,656
I'm hosting a talent hunt.

433
00:32:49,656 --> 00:32:52,186
I thought I'd come to your university.

434
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:54,656
Wow! What an idea.

435
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,871
Atif...

436
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:05,094
I think you should go somewhere else. The Dean at my college is proper grumpy.

437
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,686
Well...

438
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,206
We need young faces. Anyway...

439
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,410
We'll see in the evening.

440
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,786
Good morning, sir.

441
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,376
Good morning.

442
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,201
How are you?

443
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:19,796
I'll get going, Atif.

444
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:23,280
Meet Sanam, our talent hunt coordinator.
-Hello.

445
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,030
Hi.

446
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,601
Grab a pew.
-No, Atif. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

447
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:29,792
Wish me best of luck. Bye.
-Bye.

448
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,619
Nice to meet you!

449
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:33,642
Yes?

450
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:36,645
Who's this handsome guy?

451
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:39,455
Our maid's son.

452
00:33:41,593 --> 00:33:44,802
He's the maid's son?

453
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,754
He's cute, by the way.

454
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:54,283
Let's talk business, shall we? Show me what you've got.

455
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,556
Who is it?

456
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,806
Who did you expect?

457
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:10,166
Wow... You're actually here.

458
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:12,687
I thought you'd find some excuse again...

459
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:14,428
Oh?

460
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,016
So I...

461
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:19,586
Make excuses?

462
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,989
Did I say something wrong?

463
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,966
I don't.

464
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:32,277
I look for excuses to meet you.

465
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:37,046
Why do you need excuses to meet me?

466
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:40,550
You know that our match is a little bit odd...

467
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,060
So...

468
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,446
I have to...

469
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:45,696
I don't get it.

470
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:50,296
I mean... When we've got an understanding, a connection...

471
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,076
Age shouldn't matter...

472
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,886
You don't know how much I love you, Zoha.

473
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,630
I don't care about any of it...

474
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,210
How much do you love me?

475
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:34,576
If, after all this time, you couldn't even see how much I love you...

476
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:38,147
My love has been meaningless, Zoha...

477
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,526
Please... Don't say that.

478
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:48,478
What do you want me to say?

479
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:53,698
I'm proud to have you...

480
00:35:54,597 --> 00:36:00,977
And you say you don't know how much I love you...

481
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,068
Wow...

482
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,736
I mean, curse your love, Aqil!

483
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,716
You're mad.

484
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,250
I'm just kidding!

485
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,000
God... I thought -- What are we even talking --

486
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,270
The thing is, you couldn't know me.

487
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,800
You almost killed me there!

488
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,926
I love to fool around with you.

489
00:36:50,926 --> 00:36:54,056
Always the naughty kid, eh?

490
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:57,550
What good is growing up, anyway?

491
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:02,406
Anyway... So what's on the menu today?

492
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:04,076
Your favourite, obviously.

493
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:05,929
Ghulam Hussain!

494
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,156
My favourite...

495
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,449
And what would that be?

496
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,110
I don't need to tell him.

497
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,830
Everyone knows your favourites.

498
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,016
You're family.

499
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,756
Really?

500
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,180
Good...

501
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:37,979
That's cool...

502
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,966
Asif...

503
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,320
Who left this here?

504
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,361
I did...

505
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,490
You didn't go for lunch. I thought I should give it to you.

506
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,670
Thank you so much, but I'm not hungry.

507
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,970
My Mum's made meatballs. She's quite the cook.

508
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,290
Try and tell me if you like them.

509
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,679
Thank you so much, but...

510
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,916
Seriously, I'm not hungry at all.

511
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:37,296
Mum says you don't give the food someone's sent you back. Please, have it.

512
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:41,588
But your mother didn't prepare it for me.

513
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,900
I've had what Mum packed for me.

514
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,916
Please, have it. And if not, take it home.

515
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,181
Someone else will.

516
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,702
Sent the video to Atif?

517
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,616
I'm sure he'd love it!

518
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:17,506
Oh?

519
00:39:17,506 --> 00:39:21,256
Put plainly, you wanted to show your performance off!

520
00:39:21,256 --> 00:39:23,837
I like it when Atif praises me.

521
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:25,836
You're so lucky.

522
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:31,446
You live in Atif's mansion even though he's no one to you, and get loved like a brother!

523
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:33,430
Not just love...

524
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,519
He gets pocket money too!

525
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:41,019
Which is exactly why Her Majesty's head over heels for him.

526
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,076
Excuse me!

527
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:47,820
How'd you find out if she's head over heels for him, or he for her?

528
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,914
It's one or the same.
-Not quite, m'boy.

529
00:39:50,914 --> 00:39:54,300
Girls today are smart when it comes to love.

530
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,000
The love is as deep as the boy's pockets!

531
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,800
Malika's not like that, my dear.

532
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,911
That's where you're wrong, my friend.

533
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:06,393
She hasn't the foggiest.

534
00:40:06,393 --> 00:40:07,690
Oh?

535
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,690
So you mean she'd leave me if she found out?

536
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,916
Absolutely.
-Absolutely.

537
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:19,936
Love is blind to status, mate.

538
00:40:19,936 --> 00:40:24,770
Well, in that case, go and tell her who you are.

539
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,746
Don't even think about it!

540
00:40:34,746 --> 00:40:38,907
We're just kidding. You took it too seriously!

541
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,566
Mate...

542
00:40:42,116 --> 00:40:45,009
I think you're right...

543
00:40:45,537 --> 00:40:48,220
I should tell Malika the truth.

544
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,207
No way, mate. Please. Don't.

545
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:53,578
You're mad when it comes to love.

546
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:56,548
She can take it,

547
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:58,959
But you can't.

548
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,720
3, 2, 1...

549
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:14,690
♪ <i>I'm longing for your love but you are moving away</i> ♪

550
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:21,566
♪ <i>So don't leave me behind still words I want to say...</i> ♪

551
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,690
You've been changing the channel ever since you got in. Talk to me for a change, maybe?

552
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:49,036
What else do I do? I thought I'd listen to some music I like... It's a long ride and I'd get bored...

553
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:52,830
So my company bores you!

554
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,896
No way, mate.

555
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,206
Anyway...

556
00:41:56,206 --> 00:42:02,926
When are you taking me to your place?

557
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,876
Tell me.

558
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:10,916
Malika...

559
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,606
Oh, muck...
-Oh my God...

560
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:16,436
What'd you do, Noriyan?

561
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:20,225
He's coming, Noriyan...
-Relax.

562
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,751
Think you'd show it off to your girlfriend?
-Mind your tongue.

563
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:32,001
Just get out. I'll show you how much you've damaged my car.
-No, Noriyan!

564
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:34,955
I'm leaving if you got out.

565
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,470
Please get going!
-Hello!

566
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,100
You coming?

567
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,381
Can you wait until I park it?

568
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:42,540
I'm coming.

569
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,420
Go park.

570
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,550
What were you thinking?

571
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:02,600
Were you just going to fight him like a chav?

572
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,996
As if you've got a shortage of cars!

573
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:10,227
If I don't, it doesn't mean I can go about ramming random cars on the road!

574
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:12,488
Can't you look where you're going?

575
00:43:12,488 --> 00:43:15,064
It's not that...

576
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,730
It's not my car... That's why...

577
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,646
What?

578
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
