1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told your Mum to keep an eye on her son.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should she?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're here now.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your turn.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you so much, you little twit!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just like your Dad. As smart and cultured as he was.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All thanks to your blessings, Granny.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came here, but you were busy talking to Mum. I thought I'd rather not interrupt.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Mum's like a daughter to me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who would a daughter talk to but her mother?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's started complaining to you the moment you came here?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing of the sort, m'lad.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always remember that she only wishes for what's good for you.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Granny.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks that Malika doesn't feel the same way about you.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you worried, Granny? I'm sure time will fix everything.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord will so...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going with Salma to your Aunt's tomorrow.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was asking about you. She said she'd come here to meet you.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Aunt's so wise and brave...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After her husband's death, she's raised her children all by herself.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Salma told me Aqil's the same old carefree, irresponsible lad?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt tries her best... But he just doesn't listen.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It pains mothers so much when their kids are so irresponsible.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord makes things easy for her.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amen.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should get some rest. I'll get some sleep too.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
-Good night.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget to take your pills.
-Bless you.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just waiting for you to fix the date.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you crazy? I'd get married at this age?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... I'm talking about Novera!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yeah...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you doing things a bit too quickly?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think so!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd always thought of making Novera my daughter-in-law.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I got word you're shifting here, I decided that the first thing I'm doing is asking you to fix the date.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I want too, Sumeyra, but I think we're taking things too fast...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what they want, too! They look so good together!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever noted how they have an understanding?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of course... They're cousins, after all!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't think they see each other as husband and wife...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want what you want, but marriage is a big decision. You got to think. It takes time.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take your time.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure we can get them engaged?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, that's good.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then. Talk to Novera and tell me the date.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, again. I'll talk to her and get back to you.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to decide in my favour.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do my best. The rest is up to God.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I trust you.
-Have something.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Mum would've talked about the wedding with Uncle.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? Are you serious?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. You don't know Mum.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, I'm sure they would've fixed the date too.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25th, next month? Yeah.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfect.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about my life. They won't decide anything before asking me.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and tell them.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them what you think.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so bold and independent. Just tell them.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure am.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much that I can reject your proposal in your face.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, right. Good one.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at yourself, fraidy cat!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you up to?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're nice...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Handsome...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wise, too...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...
-If I'm nice...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Handsome, and wise, what else do you want?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't get all of it in one man here! When they get so lucky, girls don't get tired thanking God!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're one lucky girl, I give you that!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor girls...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They have to compromise on everything.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor girls...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it! I'm not one of them.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you everything.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's have something else? Excuse me!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think these curtains are just too old...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should change them. How about some new bedsheets too?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a new fabric on what you're sitting on would make it good as new!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we should get a new sofa over here.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright? Sounds like you hit the jackpot.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something like that. By the way... Aren't these wall hangings, like, ancient?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should change these too.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If we're getting a new sofa, how about one that's golden and fawn?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not bad.
-You may go.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's getting a new sofa?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika. She says we ought to change the curtains too. And the wall hangings.

102
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:13,830
But why? Everything's great. We don't need any of that.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing's great, Mum. You haven't seen how they all live.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even small houses look good with expensive things.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ours is a weird place we can't invite anyone to.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you want to invite?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan's coming here with his Mum.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's Noriyan?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and do the dishes, Munni.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you send her away? What's the big deal if she heard it?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't something to shout from the rooftops either.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When's she coming?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them they've got to make do with these sofas.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're straight out of the top drawer, Mum... And they're coming to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They can't sit here!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them we haven't got a place befitting a royal here.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If they're okay with it, I can go to their place and talk about it.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't, really, but you put it down in the dumps.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me be clear - they'll have to sit on these sofas.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's doing it for them? I'm doing it for us! It'll earn us respect in their eyes!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Things don't earn respect. Your character, your civility - that's what earns respect.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you're so ancient!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed. I shouldn't even be here in this age. But I can't help it. I'll go on as long as I'm alive.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you always say these things?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I love you so much...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't talk to anyone else about what I wish for. That's why I sometimes...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've worked so hard all my life so you never feel in want of anything.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it seems it's all been wasted. I've failed miserably.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Mum... I have no complaints.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so unthankful... But you wouldn't be whining about everything you wish for if you understood any of it!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll thank God for everything once I leave as Noriyan's bride.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, I have no problem with your marriage.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done with it? Show me the scarf.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, I'm really missing you, but you'll have to wait another week. I'm so busy...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm missing you so much, and you're 'busy'?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say that. I asked you to come with me, but you refused...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish I didn't...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know... Same here...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry. I'll be back soon.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's you! What happened?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to talk.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What brings you here? So late, I mean...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wake up in the evening.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you to go to your Aunt's to congratulate Asim.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will, when I see him.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry as if it wasn't your fault!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He tried his best to get you a job.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please ask him not to care so much.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't need his favours!

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me what I've asked.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go when I get time.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, get some sleep. It's late.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good that I saw you here. I heard something really odd.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's brother - Aqil! Blimey!

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My son told me he's with a rich woman.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a feeling they're already married.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Parvin... You say just about anything.
-You don't like anything I say.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mark my words, time will prove me right.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That can't be. And even if it is, what's it to you?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just so wrong!

167
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,342
She's much older than Aqil!

168
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:55,772
Anyway... Age is just a number when the vaults are wide open.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if our kids followed in his footsteps?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's easy. Keep an eye on your kids instead. Make sure they don't follow in his footsteps.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not kidding about it! Really!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's quick bucks seem to be her gifts!

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Women like her control their men with their money!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Parvin... Heaven knows what you think...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've sworn not to believe anything I say. Alright, I won't talk about it again.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if you didn't talk to me about anyone else.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Backbiting is sinful. It's best if you kept me out of it!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough. I won't say a word now. Nothing. About nobody. Good or bad. To the dickens with everyone!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no one else I can talk to, but you've hurt me too.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't go to university today.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be going a bit late today.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika... Go in.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mum --
-Go!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you send her in?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We need to talk.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me Aunt's asked for the date again.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get your hopes up...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The other day, Asim and your Aunt --
-Hold up.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me say something, Mum...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna give that Asim a proper beating if he or Aunt went back on their word!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare he reject Malika now?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll drag him here, I swear!

194
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:27,705
Asim and your Aunt have not gone back on their word. Malika has.

195
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:30,356
What?

196
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:35,701
How dare she? Malika!
-She loves someone else.

197
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,241
Why didn't you cut her to pieces already?
-Are you out of your mind?

198
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:46,783
Oh, is it a crime to love now?
-I'll cut that brassy tongue of yours!

199
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:52,235
Well, what do you think about innocently chatting up God-knows-who behind closed doors all night?

200
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:53,808
I'll tell you what I think!
-Aqil!
-Aqil!

201
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:57,958
Wait! Let me handle this!

202
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,735
You wanna lock horns with me? Me!?
-I don't need to lock horns with anyone!

203
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:10,137
I can talk to everyone about him! Can you say the same?
-You ruddy slapper!
-Munni!
-Aqil!

204
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,068
Calm down!

205
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:18,392
Cool down and think about it. Want to create a scene? Just think about your sister!

206
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:21,822
What about the scene she's creating?

207
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:27,562
The family, the neighbours, my friends - they all know she's been engaged to Asim for years!

208
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:29,512
Things can change...

209
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:32,224
What?

210
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,945
I can't believe you're saying that!
-Aye. I'm saying that.

211
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:43,547
When kids start deciding for themselves, they can't see any good in what their parents had decided for them.
-Enough!

212
00:16:43,547 --> 00:16:46,948
She's not going to university again!

213
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:49,620
I'm sure someone there is leading her astray!

214
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,562
What if I told you she's not being led astray?

215
00:16:55,562 --> 00:17:00,072
His name's Noriyan. He's very well-off.

216
00:17:00,072 --> 00:17:07,783
Malika thinks she can get everything she ever wished for if she married him.

217
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:10,293
His mother wants to meet us.

218
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:14,581
That's where she's wrong! She won't never be satisfied!

219
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:22,684
I tell you - no one's coming here, or there will be trouble! Are we clear? Now go and tell her!

220
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,285
That will be all.
-Aqil!

221
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,689
Aqil!

222
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,096
Out of their bleedin' minds!

223
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,761
Jesus, these two!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you pick a fight with him? You should've let Mum do the talking.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know just what Mr White-As-Snow's been up to!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been up to the same.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. How can you forget what he's done?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't create problems, Malika.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine with you being okay with it.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't really matter if I'm okay with it.
-Why not?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who the devil is Aqil to go against you? You're our Mum!

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only I were respected so much!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please be done with it, Mum -- Blimey...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you get it? You may be done with it, but not Mum. Your refusal's hurt her so much.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me a sister's closer than a daughter.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wrong.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love and affection draw you close.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ties of blood become meaningless when they don't give a monkey's about anything.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow... Didn't know you were into the art of lecturing!

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure something's forced Mum to think Noriyan would be better for you than Asim. But I don't think you can find anyone better than him.

241
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:53,595
Jeez, y'alls givin' me a headache!

242
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:57,488
Where are you going?
-To hell! I don't need to tell you, young lady!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do I get a feeling you didn't want to come here?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mr Atif...

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Mr Atif'?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always call me 'Atif'. What's up with this 'Mr' business?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk like friends, mate.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're such a big name in the industry. I should respect that.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so awkward with friends, really... And we're friends, okay?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mentioned a shoot.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's this big client...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If this shoot goes well, you can go anywhere you want in showbiz.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't think I can do it...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know my family doesn't know I'm into this...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... There's no going back now.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Relax.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it easy.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want fame?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just money, then, eh?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's easy. Just marry a rich guy.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's his name? Your boyfriend?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, him. What's his status?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just what I want.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will he marry you?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? He loves me.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves you. Do you love him?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously. I love him too.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, then...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marry him...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think he'll marry you once you're into modelling and all...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

276
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:07,686
You're new here...

277
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,886
There's a lot you don't know yet...

278
00:21:11,886 --> 00:21:15,237
Our industry can be a proper cruel place.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ties don't matter here. Just... Fame and fortune...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll lose it all if you got married.

281
00:21:34,936 --> 00:21:38,998
Anyway... Good luck...

282
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:42,008
If that's what you want... Take a shot.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

284
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:53,008
Hey...

285
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:59,209
Join me for coffee, maybe?

286
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,528
A little farewell party?

287
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,020
Okay.

288
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,799
Just give me a minute. Sit.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanted to talk about something? What is it?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think Noor said Malika's not coming to university because her Mum's sick.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, why?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw her on a date.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, bro. I'm sure you saw someone else. She loves him.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I'm positive. If anyone's mistaken, it's Noriyan.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika's too clever for him. She's pullin' the wool over his eyes. I knew it!

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asif...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is where you need to stop.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know he'd mind it.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... He's our friend. We've got to tell him.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a word.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bu --
-Not. A. Word!

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Malika's cheating on Noor, so is he! They're both in for a surprise.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Noor's a friend. He should know if Malika ain't serious about him.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just forget it, mate. Enjoy the dinner. Forget it.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you say so...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Mum?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My blood sugar shot up last night...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get the glucometer.
-I checked already. Taken the pill too.

309
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,502
You should've told me, Mum...

310
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:34,942
Why do you stress yourself?

311
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:38,184
I'm fine, Asim...

312
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:40,244
Okay, I'm not going to work.

313
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:45,224
Don't even start, Asim... I'm fine. Have your breakfast and go.

314
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:50,940
But Mum...
-I'd feel I'm sick if you stayed here...

315
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,551
I'll check again if I need.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. I'll be back before lunch.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you I'll call if I need something... Anyway... Your breakfast...

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy, Mum. I'll cook something.
-No. Wait. Let me...

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some rest, Mum. Please.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Breakfast's ready. I'll get you some tea.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you do everything when you're not well?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're so worried about me... Get married.

323
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:21,789
I never said no.

324
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:27,489
Well, just get over the one who has and move on.

325
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,450
I'll get some tea.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim... The boss wants this statement today.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Today?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... Boss' orders. Any problems?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No... Mum's not really well... I thought I'd go back early...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The boss is furious...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't talk to him. Maybe try something yourself?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I'll do it.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, thank you.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing serious, really...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd get her checked up though...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've taken the day off.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's okay... There's a lot going on... The delegation next week, this assignment and all...

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to me, I'll complete it.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, but you've got your hands full already. I'll do it.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No worries. Aunt needs to see a doctor. I'll complete it and forward it to the boss.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, Sana?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sumeyra and I have decided to get you and Waqas engaged.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Dad...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think it's a little too early?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. I'm not forcing it on you. It's up to you.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad... I...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really like Waqas, but...
-But what? Tell me.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She talked about getting you married. But I said it's too early.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She talked about our marriage?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can get engaged to him if you say, Dad...

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I need some more time... To know him better, to really understand him.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you have no problem with the engagement, right?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you've thought about it.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I trust you.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll tell Sumeyra. Take your time.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get to know Waqas. The more you know him, the more you'll like him!

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Dad... Why are you in a hurry to get me married?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's every father's wish.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a responsibility.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sumeyra's my sister, Waqas' my nephew... I can trust them to take care of you.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Dad.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you think it's the best for me, I'm okay with it.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you've thought a lot about it.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I totally agree with you.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you promised me you'd take me on a tour of Pakistan!

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say right now? I can call Waqas and we can all go!

369
00:28:59,623 --> 00:29:03,044
You're tagging Waqas along already! You promised me that you're gonna take me to the Northern Areas!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No Waqas. Just you and me. Okay?

371
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:07,073
Yeah!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me just call Sumeyra.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Dad.
-Get me some hot coffee, will you?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Dad, do your thing, and I'll get you a nice coffee.
-Aye, my dear. Bless you.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't have to take me to the doctor.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm relieved now, Mum...

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't tell you because you get so worked-up.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You came back early and took me to the doctor...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just do as you like!

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good afternoon.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good afternoon. It's Sana. Just called to let you know I've completed the report and sent it to Mr Sohail.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing. How's Aunt?

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's fine now. We're just back from the doctor's.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You remember Sana? At the office?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me talk to her.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants to talk to you...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.
-Hello, my dear. How are you?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine. How are you? Asim was so worried about you.

392
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,560
I'm good. But he gets worried sick, I tell you!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care, Aunt.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you. Why didn't you come here?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over when you've got some time.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, Aunt...

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asim will text you the address. Okay?

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Aunt.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Text her.

403
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,821
Blimey, Mum...

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's right...

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ought to tell Malika the truth.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she loves me enough to forgive my lies...?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noriyan...

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told her?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't say it?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't come to university today.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've called her.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her phone's off.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry... You can talk to her tomorrow.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact...

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me to her place tomorrow.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her myself.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell her your truth.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This fear of losing her won't let the truth come out of your mouth.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be hurt I didn't tell her the truth.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This fear shows your love. I'll tell her about it.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell her that I believe I can give her every comfort in life.

427
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:02,304
Those who believe in love never covet any other comfort.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aqil's calling. You're going over to Salma's.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've severed one tie, but it's not like they're nobody now!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Salma's not well... Just pay her a visit. A short one?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why can't you go? She's your sister!

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a headache. I can go with Munni some other day.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you send her? She'd be oh-so-eager to go there!

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't try to have your way every time!

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look. It's not like Aunt'll be pleased to see me. It just ain't no good.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt.
-Hello. Come in.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum said you're not well?

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, in the morning. I'm good now. I'll get you something.

442
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:23,605
No. Not in the mood.

443
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:28,825
Sit. Asim's coming any moment. He's gone to drop a guest.

444
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:37,598
Well, Aunt, that depends on the - uh - <i>guest</i>. Innit?</i>

445
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:45,855
She's his colleague, and she was checking on me.

446
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:49,017
That's sweet...

447
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:54,228
His colleague... With him for hours, I'm sure.

448
00:34:54,799 --> 00:35:04,390
Blimey, he's got some proper nice female *ahem* <i>colleagues</i>. Comin' here, gettin' cosy and all, I mean.</i>

449
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:11,183
Sure, she's proper nice. He's proper nice too.

450
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:17,265
That's why, Aunt, I tell you to keep an eye on him.

451
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:21,063
I've seen her with him before.

452
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:28,676
She's with him everyday. At the office.

453
00:35:28,676 --> 00:35:38,896
Lemme get this straight. She used to be with him at the office... And now she's with him in his car. Making progress, I see!

454
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:43,676
I sent Asim with her. It's nothing of the sort.

455
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:47,576
It better <i>be</i> nothing of the sort, Aunt.</i>

456
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:52,856
Because I won't take nothing <i>of the sort</i>.</i>

457
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:56,436
Take care.

458
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:58,237
I'll get going.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can take his sister's refusal but not my son getting in the car with someone!

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called to tell you I'm not going to university tomorrow.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you ask why?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming with Mum to your place.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah!

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me you're not delighted!

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, Malika... I wanted to tell you something...

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Malika...

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you so much...

473
00:36:56,716 --> 00:37:00,050
You're all I want in my life...

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'd be hurt to hear it, but...

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munni!

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me my protein shake. Quick.

479
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:19,317
I'm no billionaire, Malika.

480
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:28,125
Mum's the maid at this mansion.

481
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,045
And...

482
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:35,195
I live in the basement with Mum...

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
