1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you were telling the truth, you would've talked to your Mum.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I believe that so powerful a man can be so helpless?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to convince her, Noor us-Saba, but she just won't listen!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, make her, Alam! A mother would do anything for her son!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've tried everything!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't like working women.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't want that kind of a daughter-in-law!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's a dinosaur... She doesn't get any of it...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alam...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Don't tell me you think the same way...</i>

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If someone's sacrificed everything she's got for you, it's because of her love!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just shoot me, Alam...
-Are you out of your mind?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just shoot me if you ever thought I'm 'that type'.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please don't disgrace my love like that...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry if it hurt you... I just blurted it out in anger... I was... Unsettled...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't see a way out.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I found an excuse to call Mum here.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll be in Karachi in a few days...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm gonna introduce her to you.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So smile now, will ya?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That leaves just one loose end...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your, uhm...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Mum doesn't know about your -- uh -- condition.</i>

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you tell Mum --?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you mad? Do you really think I'd tell her that? 'Didn't you tell Mum' -- Jesus...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about accepting this proposal... She won't even meet you!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can we do, Alam?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd have to sacrifice the kid...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait. Sit down. Let me finish.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't have another way out, Noor us-Saba.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't be so selfish...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Selfish?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if it isn't my child! It pains me much more than you.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no other way.
-Well, then, make one!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba... I need your help.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, stand by me. Don't add to my worries. How'd I tell anyone --

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't have to know. Not before the marriage.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh? 'Not before the marriage'! As if Mum won't get a thing! What do you think she is?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if she accepted the proposal, there's no way I'm getting married before Erum. What are we gonna do?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still, let's say we do get married.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think society would accept our child? Do you think Mum would accept him?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you think would have to suffer?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it's very difficult for you...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you truly love me...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please do as I say...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You risk losing me forever...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord</i>

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Decide my fate</i>

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waiting for someone?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, Mum's coming here.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd go to the airport to pick her up.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a few days... When she's fine, I'll introduce her

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a few days... When she's fine, I'll introduce her to Mum.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. Be brave.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're doing what's best for us. I'm with you. Go.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go. I love you.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take her to Dr Rukhsar.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not fair, Alam.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see her, Alam?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see the pain on her face?
-Here we go again...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You her friend or mine?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My honour is at stake, but all you can see is her pain!</i>

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, who cares about honour these days anyway?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me my breakfast, Mum! I'm getting late for work!

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it, Mum?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you thinking?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to the doctor with your Dad's reports.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he say?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He told me to get a bypass done as soon as possible.
-A bypass?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just how? I'm afraid we haven't got anything...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd we get the money?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The doctor even said that if we didn't get it done in time...
-Don't say that, Mum! Nothing's gonna happen to Dad.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure God will show us the way...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We haven't got anything we can sell...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to Mr Alam. Ask for a loan.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've just started working...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd they give you a loan?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should try.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you see another way?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm worried about...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've just started working... What if he got angry?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would he? The worst he can do is refuse.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we should try.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows? God may make him have mercy.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you think... Anyway, have your breakfast.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't have breakfast. I'll get going. Talk to him first thing I get there.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been discharged. Please change.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jan'e Alam -- The man with me?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know about him.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the bill?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been paid.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please vacate the room as soon as you can.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord</i>

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put some music on, Malik.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A touch of innocence, a stranger you are...</i>

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life-breath, my longing you are...</i>

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's fine now, right?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No problems?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Everything's okay now.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Alam...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Aunt here?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, 'why'?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was never coming here.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you said she took the flight last night...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was lying.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, when you can blackmail me...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't I tell you one teeny tiny lie?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of which, here's your gift. For blackmailing me.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miss Noor us-Saba!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your termination letter.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all a prank, innit?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't... I'm so worried, Alam...
-No.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time has played a dreadful prank on you.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you think?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you think I'd give in to you?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you think I'd actually marry you if you blackmailed me?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you must be raving mad.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A man may imagine a relationship with you...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it ain't gonna be marriage...

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the meaning of all of this?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you loved me! You wanted to marry me!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes... Love...

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know what's a woman's greatest weakness?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amour...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love. That's what she craves.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all she wants from a man.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd give anything to get a man who gives her that...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even her life.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some are so stupid that they know their man's faking it all, lying to them...

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this game of love is so... Alluring...

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That they'd rather live a lie blindly for just a tiny bit of a man's attention.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not your fault.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a woman, after all.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alam...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really love you.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've sacrificed so much for you, Alam.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, let me tell you this, Noor us-Saba...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The allure of anything lasts only as long as it's distant.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's this allure...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That women like you mistake...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For love...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had no idea that's who I was in your eyes...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever you were in my eyes...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't say I didn't give you your worth.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave you a decent job, a house...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave you rides in my luxury cars...

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... I've had enough of you...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should change. Get going. I've paid the bills.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go to my apartment. I've sold it.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alam!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alam...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't leave me...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd I go without you?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die without you...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, there's one place you can go to...

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hell!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord</i>

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Decide my fate</i>

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weighing down on my eyes</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Both restless and unsettled</i>

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I might die of them</i>

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your truthful treacheries</i>

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All that you have done</i>

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You know it in your heart</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Behold, now, as God makes his move</i>

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Alam sent me here.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wants you to move out as soon as you can.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't like this one but... I've got a flat if you need one.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Same deal as with Mr Alam - you just have to keep me happy.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think I am?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I know what you are. A helpless woman desperate for a man's help.</i>

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can help you.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it that you've been demoted...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up and get out of my place!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your place?</i>

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said get out -- Out --

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or else?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna call the cops? Complain to Mr Alam?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Funny, innit? I mean, he was complainin' about you!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta go. I'll be back tomorrow. You better move out.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or I'll throw you out myself.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd pain me... Really...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please consider my offer.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Ma'am?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your name?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meryem.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing here?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I work here. I'm Mr Alam's PA.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you ask?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There was a time, not long ago...

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When I used to sit here.</i>

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your Mr Alam's ex

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your Mr Alam's ex-PA.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who he fired and...

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Replaced with you.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a decent girl, Meryem...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- quit this job, okay?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wait... I'm sure you will...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he in his room?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have an appointment?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need to take one.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- Ma'am! Please! Stop! You can't just --

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I don't like --
-You can't -- He's busy right now!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to stop her, sir, but she barged in.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may leave.
-Yes, sir.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I figure you've found my replacement.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's replaced you, Noor us-Saba.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You did it all to yourself by not listening to me.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've gladly let you keep your status if only you'd listened!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Alam...
-Hey, hey, hey... Watch it! Back off! It's my office.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hands off me.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Alam...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't leave me...

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me back...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alam...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please marry me...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus... How many times do I have to tell you? And you think I'm rude.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not - how do I put it nicely - marriage material.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You aren't homely.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So just forget about this marriage thing, will you?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you always said you want to marry me!
-Well, turns out I'm a natural liar.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, quite naturally... I lied to you.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I really loved you...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart beats for you...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your heart...

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me tell you this, Noor us-Saba... This 'heart'...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a picture frame.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With time, the picture gets dusty... Until you tire of seeing it.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what's happened...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've grown tired of seeing you... It's time to change the picture.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, don't worry. Here's the deal.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say you stop remembering everything? The memories will only trouble you more. Just move on...
-Enough, Alam...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it already...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at me!
-Yeah?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you feel my pain? Don't you feel pity?
-Jeez, Noor us-Saba, what's up with you?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so sweet. So lovely they'd all die for you.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find someone better, someone richer than me, and... Perhaps someone who'd even marry you.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anyone else... I'm not that type!
-There, now...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you inside out.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me what --

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Why are you here?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can't do anything else for me...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't snatch the roof over my head...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd I go? What'd I do without this job?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me two months...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be out of your life as soon as I've found another job.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two months?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, you've got two months.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can stay at my flat for two months.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get your salary on time too.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you better not come here again!

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd become an untouchable in your eyes!

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, what?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Untouchable'?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like someone's been watching too many Indian dramas!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Untouchable'! Jesus...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better not see you in my office again!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'As if I'm untouchable, Jan'e Alam'!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't get why she warned me.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meryem...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got me worried too.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did she want to tell you?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you ask her why she was kicked out?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought I should...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm worried the boss might kick you out someday too...

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God forbid, Mum...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've barely got this job...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I must say you've raised your daughter well! Girls these days, they don't usually dress so decently.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got simple tastes. We never said a word.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah. We've never forced our children to do anything. It's their life.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a splendid coincidence! My son thinks the same way!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How say we introduce Jan'e Alam to Arooj? If you don't mind, of course.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask Jan'e Alam.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a bit conservative.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With that sorted out, may I take a selfie with my sister-in-law to-be?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, why not? Go ahead! Please!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May we go outside?
-Sure.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Mum.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello. Erum just sent you a picture on WhatsApp. Did you see it?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, just did.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's she? The girl with Erum?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arooj - your bride to-be! Do you like her?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that 'mission accomplished' I'm hearing?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'No' isn't an option. You left it to me, and I took care of it!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not saying no, Mum. I'd do as you say.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As always... I'm sure you'd be delighted to meet her! She's so lovely, so smart, and so nice!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd look great together!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you'll do what's best.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to her parents if you like her.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come to Islamabad for a small engagement ceremony. We can fix the date of the wedding then. What do you say?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine by me.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll come over when I'm free.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll be waiting.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He likes her!
-How couldn't he? I mean, just look at her!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Why do people get married?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder, Mum...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do we fear our past so much?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's always happy memories to ease the pain of bitter ones...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do we forget them?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do we always remember our helplessness, or what we lack?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because we're afraid of losing whatever we've got and pushed back to helplessness.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's always the pain, the hurt, the hardships that affect us in the long run... More than happiness.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so sad?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to the doctor today...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said we've got to get a bypass done quick or it will be bad...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've talked to Mr Alam...

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's hope for the best.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a lot of money... So...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go check on your Dad.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fix an appointment for tomorrow.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll confirm.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've approved a loan of 500,000 for you.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
500,000?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I only asked for 200,000.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, but it won't get you anywhere. Not in this day and age.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you're going to need all of it for your father's treatment.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sir...

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a big sum... I don't think I'll be able to pay it back...

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like you're quitting the job.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can pay it back in parts.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sign here.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll transfer the amount to your account today.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's blank, sir...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes... I had it made rather quickly... Nothing we can't work out later, I'm sure?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
