1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sir...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a big sum... I don't think I'll be able to pay it back...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like you're quitting the job.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can pay it back in parts.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sign here.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll transfer the amount to your account today.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's blank, sir...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes... I had it made rather quickly... Nothing we can't work out later, I'm sure?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you trust me?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that, sir...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then just sign it, will you?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll transfer the amount to your account today.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, sir.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No problem.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M -- Meryem?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Noor us-Saba. I'm outside the office.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you come for a second?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute.
-Okay.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello... You called me here. What is it?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look so... Happy...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am happy. Mr Alam's helped me a lot.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lent me some money for Dad's operation...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Alam's so nice...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Caring.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can feel our pain...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how to give them pain...

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't get it.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you will...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meryem...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time opens our eyes...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So will it open yours.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This -- This is where bad luck begins...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you blind yourself to the truth and start believing the lies, the deceit...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just because it promises the world of our dreams that we know isn't real...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're so foolish, Meryem...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So foolish that we choose to live the lie with the most vile of people... Until... Until...

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until one day...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They desert you and you find out...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no going back...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I talked to him... He said tomorrow... I --

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you in a sec.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying? I don't understand anything.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will... Soon, you will...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when you do, I may not be around to comfort you.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what's the problem with our type?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our desires, our needs... They kill us!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not a good man!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jan'e Alam! He'd rob you of your dignity, your love! That's how he rewards loyalty!

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me, Meryem, I know him!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think it's likely, but if you can bring yourself to it...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about what I've just told you...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not a good man!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jan'e Alam! He'd rob you of your dignity, your love! That's how he rewards loyalty!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what's the problem with our type?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our desires, our needs... They kill us!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meryem!

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're meeting a client right now.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, sir.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be waiting outside.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With me.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord</i>

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Decide my fate</i>

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure you don't want to have anything?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, I haven't brought you here to meet a client.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to tell you something...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something you don't know.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba didn't resign from her job.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I fired her.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir? But why?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was blackmailing me.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanted to slander me.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'But why', I can hear you thinking.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I loved Noor us-Saba a lot, Meryem...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love that women would only dream of...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to marry her, too...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But unfortunately, Mum...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't want her as my wife...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried convincing Mum...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But - it pains me even as we speak - I couldn't...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba asked me to get married in court.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't go against my Mum for her...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, naturally, I refused.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She started blackmailing me... Threatened to shame me.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is what she did when I did not give in.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Accused me of the unimaginable... Slandered me before everyone at the office...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even look anyone in the eye now...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may never believe it, but when Noor us-Saba first came to me, she had nothing...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave her a good job, a place to stay, a car...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is how she returned the favour...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I'm sure He's watching...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'll try to tell you her lies, and you will eventually start believing her...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, sir...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I trust you. No matter what she says.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thank goodness someone trusts me...</i>

111
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,493
The tea's fantastic, by the way... How say...

112
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:41,743
Excuse me!

113
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:43,914
One cuppa please?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well ain't someone gettin' a little too close to Jan'e Alam?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd he take you, eh? For dinner?
-Eww!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ohhh...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I nearly forgot!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's already impressed you!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye! Already impressed you!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Impressed!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's right, though...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a doddle to trap our type!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare say another word, Noor us-Saba!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or --
-Or what?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can you do?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT JUST YET!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gonna tell Jan'e Alam?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go. Go tell Jan'e Alam, sweetie.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can't do nothin'!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But remember...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought why he's being so... Kind to you?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, he's real kind!

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought he was kind too...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Real...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kind...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had to pay a real big price for it...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Real big price...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AND SO WILL YOU!!!

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will, too!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tick, tock, tick, tock...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna be Jan'e Alam's next target!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's it?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you'd allow me...
-Sure.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say the Lord's name and put the ring on her. Show him your hand, love.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the true face of your good samaritan Jan'e Alam...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a wolf, a BLIMMING WOLF!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't no man...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a wolf...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Save yourself, Meryem...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's still time.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're lying.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't believe a word you say.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And keep your fake pictures with you!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep them.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember this day when you look at them.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew it...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you won't believe me.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew he's blinded you...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like he blinded me...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming back...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From the road you're travelling...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't want to go on, Meryem...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me... Just... Don't...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am... Please be kind to me. In the Lord's name?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll bless you.
-NO!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want any blessings...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gold chain.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want it?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, pray...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray... 'Noor us-Saba... May the Lord'...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray... 'Noor us-Saba... May the Lord kill you'!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Heavens, what are you sayi --
-DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT?
-Of course, Ma'am...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill you! Kill you...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RAISE YOUR HANDS AND SCREAM! I WANNA HEAR YOU SCREAM! 'NOOR US-SABA, MAY THE LORD KILL YOU'!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill Noor us-Saba!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say... 'May the Lord kill Noor us-Saba right there'!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill you right there -- Noor us-Saba... Right there...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill you!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord -- May the Lord kill you!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill Noor us-Saba!
-Kill Noor us-Saba...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right there...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord kill you!
-Kill Noor us-Saba...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Die, Noor us-Saba... A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weighing down on my eyes</i>

<i>Die... Weighing down on my eyes</i>

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Both restless and unsettled</i>

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>DIE!!! Both restless and unsettled</i>

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I might die of them</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Die... I might die of them</i>

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your truthful treacheries</i>

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Die... Your truthful treacheries</i>

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All that you have done</i>

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You know it in your heart</i>

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Behold, now, as God makes his move</i>

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you have something?
-Sure, thanks!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want some more?
-No, thank you.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your daughter, by the way?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's studying with her friends. Exams these days, you know.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Bless her...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well if you're done with the investigation...
-Okay...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're here to ask for something very dear to you...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We wanted to ask for your daughter's hand in matrimony. For our son.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But isn't it...

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't refuse.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We want Erum to be our daughter-in-law.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure, but...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your daughter is going to be our daughter-in-law...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So this would be...
-So what?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You liked our daughter the moment you saw her. The same way we liked Erum.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you have refused if we'd proposed our son's marriage first?

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't seriously mean... A sister-exchange?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Just think it's best for our families.
-Of course.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd need some time...

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't decide alone. Alam cares for Erum like a daughter.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have to ask him.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll meet Alam when I go to Karachi. I can talk to him myself.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you wish.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to have this!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, you're very kind... After you.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Karachi'

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't have to bother yourself, Uncle. You could've called me to Islamabad.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing, really. I thought I'd see you while I'm here for business.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, there's something we need to talk about.
-Yeah?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure your mother's told you that we've asked for Erum's hand in marriage for our son Jahanzeb.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, she mentioned it.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need some time, Uncle.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Erum's my only sister... I'd like to ask her.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no problem if she's happy with it. We can organise a small engagement ceremony.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's good.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you decide in our favour.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord will thus... Please, have something.

249
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:09,016
Do you enjoy being disrespected again and again?

250
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:10,656
Why are you here?

251
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:22,141
Gotta have some respect to be disrespected.

252
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:28,941
You never gave me any.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing? Get off!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind the cameras!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put up with me one last time.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't see me again...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if you wanted to.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe it, can you?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I assure you.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got one last wish, Alam...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One last wish?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to visit your room.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your room...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's redolent with your fragrance...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to take you in...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to drown in it one last time...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not gonna stop me, are you, Alam?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's one condition.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better not see you again.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not in my office, not around here, not... Anywhere.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Psycho!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Behold, now, as God makes his move...</i>

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My Master...</i>

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I worry about you a lot. I really love you.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If someone pointed a finger at you, it would drive me really furious.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weighing down on my eyes</i>

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Both restless and unsettled</i>

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I might die of them</i>

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your truthful treacheries</i>

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All that you have done</i>

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You know it in your heart</i>

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Behold, now, as God makes his move</i>

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd have to sacrifice the kid...
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise... You risk losing me forever...
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're doing what's best for us. I'm with you.
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't leave me... I'd die without you...
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't leave me... I'd die without you...
<i>O Lord</i>

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hell!
<i>O Lord</i>

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Decide my fate...</i>

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My Master...</i>

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd you see her?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was going to pray when I saw her. I called you right away.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's here at night?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one, sir.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone leaves at 7.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm stationed at the gate.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see anyone come here?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want the statements of everyone here.
-Yes, sir.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's leaving before we've talked to you.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget the tea, Mum, I'll just do with the breakfast!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rickshaw's been waiting for half an hour!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M --
-Here.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You had to bring everything!
-Have your breakfast properly.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm getting late...

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy there. What's with the hurry?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should get going.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Finish your breakfast.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta go. I'm late already.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meryem...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad has an appointment with the surgeon next week.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask your boss for a leave.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to him today.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Finish your breakfast! You haven't had anything!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really late, Mum. Have to dash!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba had been all distressed ever since Mr Alam sacked her.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you know?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Noor us-Saba committed suicide.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
RAISE YOUR HANDS AND SCREAM! I WANNA HEAR YOU SCREAM! 'NOOR US-SABA, MAY THE LORD KILL YOU'!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
