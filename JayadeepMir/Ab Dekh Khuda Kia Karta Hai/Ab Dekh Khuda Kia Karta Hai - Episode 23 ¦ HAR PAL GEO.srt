1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,067
Shani...

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,000
What happened, Mum?

3
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:19,660
What is happening!

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,010
It is time...

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,040
No way, Mum...

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,810
Please don't say that.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,249
As the Lord wills.

8
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:32,215
We can't do anything.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:37,944
I don't -- have time...

10
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,336
Lis --

11
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:45,906
Listen to me...

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,780
Think of your brother --

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,458
As your Dad...

14
00:00:56,586 --> 00:01:01,665
Don't ask him anything...

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,902
I won't, Mum...

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,120
Don't --

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,040
Don't ever leave him alone...

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,930
Why are you saying that, Mum?

19
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,837
Nothing's going to happen to you.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,440
Please...

21
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:29,800
Be generous for your brother...

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,900
And --

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,401
Consider this my will...

24
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,025
I'll do as you say.

25
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:52,276
Please don't talk about leaving us.

26
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:55,338
We'll be all alone...

27
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,930
You can't leave us...

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,460
My dear...

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,997
Get Jan'e Alam here --

30
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:07,991
I need to -- talk to him...

31
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,504
Go...

32
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,410
Send him in.

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay...
-Get Jan'e Alam...

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Go.
-You'll be alright.

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,122
Quickly...

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,370
Jan'e Alam...

37
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,337
Mum.

38
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:38,587
Jan'e Alam...

39
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,112
What happened to you...

40
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:45,330
My sweet...

41
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,271
I --

42
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:59,520
I've --

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,017
Apologised on your behalf...

44
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,456
To whom, Mum?

45
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,470
Now --

46
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,726
Yes?

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,640
Please --

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,759
Forgive yourself...

49
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:25,993
I forgive myself.

50
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,970
Mum...

51
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,815
Mum!

52
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,818
M --

53
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,754
Mum!

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,201
No! Mum!

55
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,058
Be brave.

56
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,032
I hope Aunt will be fine.

57
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,480
Be brave, mate.

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,456
Mothers always protect their kids

59
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:43,017
From the harshness of the world.

60
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,996
Mum will be alright, right?

61
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:52,430
Of course...
-So, how can I let you be disgraced?

62
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,250
You talked to her, right?

63
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,522
Once Malik's released,

64
00:04:56,522 --> 00:05:01,220
I'll go to Meryem myself and ask forgiveness for everything you did,

65
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,164
And, if it seems meet,

66
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:07,260
Bring her back in your life.

67
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,959
What happened?

68
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,922
Mum's no more, Shani...

69
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,248
Mum's no more, Shani...

70
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,718
I think I should get going.
-Where?

71
00:05:25,718 --> 00:05:27,597
Home, of course.

72
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:30,157
What happened, Mum?

73
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,585
You haven't even had dinner.

74
00:05:32,585 --> 00:05:35,907
Please, stay here. With me.

75
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,950
She's left us...

76
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,642
I'm all alone now...

77
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:50,392
All alone...

78
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,671
Aunt...

79
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:12,705
We'll go with Dad when Uncle Shan will be there to talk about the marriage, right?

80
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,570
For the sake of your mother, Meryem,

81
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,019
Please do this mother a favour

82
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:20,822
And save her family.

83
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,520
Aunt?

84
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,180
We'll be there, right?

85
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,365
No.

86
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,529
Why?

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,322
Because I don't want to marry him.

88
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:37,233
But you liked him, didn't you?

89
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:37,955
Yes.

90
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:39,992
Not any more.

91
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,387
Is Uncle Shan a bad man like Uncle Alam too?

92
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:48,081
Will he leave you after marriage too?

93
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,456
Might as well...

94
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:02,704
They're brothers, after all...

95
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:07,347
Enough talk.

96
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:11,929
Get ready quick. It's getting late.

97
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,440
I still can't believe it...

98
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:34,297
How did Mum have an accident just like that...

99
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:38,374
Why did she leave us...

100
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:51,540
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

101
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,345
<i>It ruins its life</i>

102
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:09,190
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

103
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,932
<i>Hear my plea</i>

104
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:22,001
I'll pray for your forgiveness.

105
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,970
I'm sure the Lord will forgive all your sins.

106
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,679
You pray for me, Mum?

107
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,239
But of course, my dear.

108
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,494
Don't mothers always

109
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,237
Pray for their children?

110
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:38,925
Perhaps that's why they say there's no greater bounty than a mother.

111
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:42,060
Mothers always protect their kids

112
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,404
From the harshness of the world.

113
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:53,563
Ah, m'boy!
-Here to brighten everything up as always!

114
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:54,530
How are you?

115
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,179
I'm fine. Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

116
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,890
Be brave, Shani.

117
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,324
You'll sicken yourself weeping.

118
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:08,542
I mean --

119
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,410
How can she leave us...

120
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,443
We're all alone...

121
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,008
All alone...

122
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,827
Alone...

123
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:28,746
It's what God has willed... All we can do is be brave...

124
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:31,860
I can't be brave, mate.

125
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,941
I <i>just</i> can't be brave...

126
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,140
I <i>just</i> can't be brave...
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

127
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,986
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

128
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:45,970
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

129
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,155
Alam will be all alone if you kept crying like that.

130
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:04,885
You have to be brave for him.

131
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:07,059
Okay?

132
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,980
C'mon, Humna.

133
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,295
Let's get going.

134
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,000
Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,090
What happened? Why is the school closed?

136
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,960
School's out for three days.

137
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,318
Three days?

138
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,240
Why?

139
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,878
I'm not aware about anything of the sort.

140
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:05,199
Who told you?

141
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:08,080
Mr Shan's mother passed away.

142
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,854
What?

143
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,202
But how?

144
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:17,667
She had an accident last night.

145
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,421
May she rest in peace...

146
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,380
That may be why he didn't answer my call in the morning.

147
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,604
I should convey my condolences...

148
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:52,290
Should I call him right now?

149
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,001
No...

150
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:57,594
He'd be very upset right now.

151
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:01,445
I shouldn't call him right now.

152
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,997
Just a minute.

153
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,538
Who is it?

154
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,636
Who is it?

155
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,527
It's you!

156
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:30,293
Where's Humna?

157
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,101
Inside.

158
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,586
Humna!

159
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,054
Dad!

160
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:42,960
Dad!

161
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,049
My little doll...

162
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,909
You're back!

163
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,138
You won't leave us again, will you?

164
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,251
Please stay with us forever.

165
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,949
Do you know how much I've missed you?

166
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:57,810
Most of all on results day.

167
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,275
Everyone's parents would be with them.

168
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,557
But only Aunt came with me.

169
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:06,716
Please don't leave us again.

170
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:12,020
Never, my sweet doll. I'll be with you now. Always.

171
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,276
Here.

172
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,583
Look what I've got.
-For me?

173
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,001
And this dress.

174
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,196
Thank you, Dad.

175
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,712
Please, come in.

176
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,007
I'll get your things.

177
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,504
You like it?

178
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:30,998
Yes.

179
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:34,005
Look at this here.

180
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,483
Meryem...

181
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:47,678
I can never thank you enough

182
00:13:47,678 --> 00:13:51,663
For how you've looked after Humna in my absence.

183
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:54,146
Please don't say that.

184
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:57,581
I've done no favour.

185
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,190
You've been very kind to me.

186
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:07,597
What haven't you gone through for me...

187
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,086
In a way...

188
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:20,090
I'm responsible for separating Humna from you.

189
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,680
No, Meryem.

190
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,293
You've illuminated my life.

191
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:29,448
Made me see the light...

192
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:33,783
Were it not for you, I don't think I would ever have become human...

193
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:37,850
I, too, would've had to suffer a Meryem's curse...

194
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,276
That my daughter would've had to suffer for.

195
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,350
Dad, do you know that Aunt was about to get married?

196
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,892
Aunt?

197
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:53,885
We thought of coming to Karachi to tell you.

198
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:59,472
But no idea why... Aunt doesn't want to marry Uncle Shan now.

199
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,250
Why don't you keep everything inside?

200
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,837
No. I'll go and show Feryal first.

201
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:08,943
I'm going to Feryal's, Aunt.

202
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:11,652
Get back quickly.

203
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,913
Meryem?

204
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,981
What is it?

205
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,482
After what you've gone through,

206
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:41,510
It wouldn't be easy for you to trust my love,

207
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,280
But I promise you,

208
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,397
I'll never let you down.

209
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:50,278
I hope you can trust love so much.

210
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,121
Then, his mother had me promise...

211
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,569
That I'll be out of her son's life quietly.

212
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,536
Strange...

213
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,918
You had found refuge with the brother

214
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,586
Of the man who'd been looking for you for so long,

215
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:17,898
Yearning to meet you...

216
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,858
Did he meet you?

217
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:31,597
Not just once.

218
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,554
He tried to ask me where you live.

219
00:16:36,554 --> 00:16:41,954
I've been released before I've done my time

220
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:45,997
So that I can lead him to you.

221
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:49,778
Jan'e Alam got you released?

222
00:16:49,778 --> 00:16:51,627
Yes.

223
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:54,919
He'd come to me a broken man.

224
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,269
I beg you, Malik.

225
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,613
My soul is tormented.

226
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:07,694
Just tell me where Meryem lives. I want to apologise to her before I die.

227
00:17:08,064 --> 00:17:16,187
He would never have imagined what your curse had done to him.

228
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:20,377
What happened to him?

229
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:24,345
His sister got abducted four years ago.

230
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:27,329
M. Alam looked for her like mad,

231
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,039
But found no trace of her.

232
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,913
And then?

233
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:35,236
He found out she was in Dubai.

234
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,879
Dubai...?

235
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:41,560
A notorious gang had kidnapped her.

236
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm very afraid! He'll be coming for me again! I'm serious!

237
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,480
Before all of you have to suffer for my sins, please kill me...

238
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,033
M. Alam's innocent sister

239
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:10,517
Had to pay for every single life he had ruined and more.

240
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,756
Your Lord has pronounced his judgement, Meryem.

241
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:24,322
I'm at a loss for words...

242
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:29,999
How do I tell you how we've been disgraced...

243
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,510
I think God, Meryem,

244
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,957
Has exacted your vengeance.

245
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,647
You should forgive him.

246
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,710
What are you saying?

247
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:57,337
You know what he's done...

248
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:00,873
He's been punished for it.

249
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:05,028
Perhaps He has forgiven him, too.

250
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,177
Now,

251
00:19:08,177 --> 00:19:17,208
Would we be any better if we continue to punish M. Alam?

252
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:28,040
Even He retaineth not his anger for ever, because He delighteth in mercy.

253
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:37,915
Won't you do as your brother asks you?

254
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:42,426
You'll forgive him, won't you?

255
00:19:42,426 --> 00:19:43,331
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

256
00:19:43,331 --> 00:19:45,414
Forgive him...
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

257
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:48,357
<i>A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

258
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:54,422
<i>Weighing down on my eyes</i>

259
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:57,430
<i>Both restless and unsettled</i>

260
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,484
<i>I might die of them...</i>

261
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,115
Let's see who's been calling...

262
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,788
'I'm sorry Mr Shan but I don't want to marry you'.

263
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:25,100
What's up with her now?

264
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,101
Why is she saying that?

265
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,224
She was fine until yesterday.

266
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:31,927
Had no problems...

267
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,674
Why is her phone off?

268
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,196
Meryem!

269
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,675
I don't see Humna around.

270
00:21:09,077 --> 00:21:12,480
She's gone over to her friend Feryal's.

271
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,970
She'd rather have it this way while school's out.

272
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:22,487
Plus, she'd like to show her friend everything you've got her.

273
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:24,986
By the way...

274
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:27,813
I'm going to Islamabad.

275
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:30,289
Islamabad?

276
00:21:30,868 --> 00:21:32,615
Everything alright?

277
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:36,416
For the funeral of M. Alam's mother.

278
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,589
I'll get you your breakfast. You haven't had anything.
-No, thank you.

279
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:49,263
I forgot to clean the kitchen last night, too, it's all --
-Meryem...

280
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:54,749
M. Alam will ask me about you.

281
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:58,355
What should I tell him?

282
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:02,205
Whatever you feel like telling him.

283
00:22:03,172 --> 00:22:05,953
I understand

284
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:10,516
That it won't be easy for you to forgive him.

285
00:22:10,516 --> 00:22:14,360
Well, in that case, why are you forcing me?

286
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,135
Because he's suffered a lot.

287
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,000
Life and death is in God's hands alone.

288
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,768
He's lost his honour.

289
00:22:27,052 --> 00:22:29,145
Believe me...

290
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:33,270
Just meet M. Alam once.

291
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:38,908
You'll feel his pain if you saw him.

292
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:45,582
You'll meet him, won't you?

293
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:49,766
Alright...

294
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:53,109
If that's what you want... I won't force you.

295
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,957
Okay?

296
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:58,563
I'll get going.

297
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,747
I'll be back in the night.

298
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:03,097
Bye.
-Bye.

299
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:06,814
Wait...

300
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,541
I'll meet him.

301
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,009
I can understand your pain, M. Alam. Please, gather yourself.

302
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:05,744
I'm all alone now, mate...

303
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:11,906
Come in.

304
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:21,465
You didn't tell me how you found out

305
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,410
That Mum had passed away, Malik...

306
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,907
I was surprised about how I'd found out, too.

307
00:24:27,907 --> 00:24:29,908
I don't get it.

308
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:32,610
Meryem told me.

309
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,408
Meryem?

310
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:39,200
Yes.

311
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,393
The same Meryem you've been looking for.

312
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:46,125
How'd she find out?

313
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,081
She lives in Murree.

314
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:52,952
Meryem's in -- Murree?

315
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:55,938
I was just as surprised as you are.

316
00:24:55,938 --> 00:25:00,333
All this while, the one you'd been looking for

317
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:03,202
Had been living under the roof you'd given,

318
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,057
And you hadn't a clue...

319
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:09,800
There's something else you should know.

320
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,799
Meryem's agreed to meet you.

321
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,961
Malik...

322
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,851
Did I catch that right?

323
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,964
Yes. You heard it.

324
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:24,632
I can't believe how quickly you convinced her. How?

325
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:28,561
She would never have agreed to meet you.

326
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:33,000
But I told her about Mme. Erum.

327
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:35,591
Come.

328
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:36,669
Where, M. Alam?

329
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,387
To Meryem's.

330
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,008
Right now? But --
-Yes. I --

331
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:44,657
No, Malik, I can't wait anymore.

332
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:49,000
You don't know how I've longed to see this day.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,537
Prayed day and night for just one thing...

334
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,987
That I get to meet her once.

335
00:25:55,987 --> 00:26:00,740
I want to ask for her forgiveness.

336
00:26:01,273 --> 00:26:06,719
I can't bear the weight of my sins anymore, Malik.

337
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:10,708
I'm very tired, mate.
-Come.

338
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,774
Some people are here to convey their condolences.

339
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,662
You're... Leaving?

340
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:21,760
Yes. Something came up.

341
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,398
I'll be back in a few hours.

342
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,620
Something came up?

343
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,600
But...

344
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,855
People are coming for the funeral.

345
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,517
I'll be back in a few hours.

346
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,641
Please, meet them in my absence.

347
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:36,881
Alright, but...

348
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:40,692
Will you be in town?

349
00:26:40,692 --> 00:26:43,272
We'll be in Islamabad.

350
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,911
And you are?

351
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,904
Malik.

352
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:52,905
Who?

353
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:57,270
An old friend.

354
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,267
He's here to help. I'll need him by my side.

355
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,875
What kind of help?

356
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,803
Just pray, Shani...

357
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:14,633
That I succeed

358
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,300
At what I'm going to do.

359
00:27:19,397 --> 00:27:22,070
I'll be back. Come.

360
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,485
You'll drive?

361
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,833
Why, what happened?

362
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:57,293
It's nothing really, but every time you've been in the car with me...

363
00:27:57,293 --> 00:28:01,031
I've been your driver...

364
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,557
Not today, Malik.

365
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,951
I'm not your employer, and you're not my driver.

366
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,455
C'mon.

367
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,953
Sir...

368
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:14,357
I don't quite like it this way...

369
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:17,430
That you drive when I'm here.

370
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,114
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

371
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:22,861
Keys?

372
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,844
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

373
00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:30,928
<i>The wrath of the Heavens</i>

374
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:34,904
<i>Obloquies yours</i>

375
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:38,894
<i>Shall resound in this world</i>

376
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:42,897
<i>Ashes yours</i>

377
00:28:42,897 --> 00:28:46,909
<i>Shall be blown away with the winds</i>

378
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,872
<i>Dead ends shall you find</i>

379
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:54,191
<i>In your room in every heart</i>

380
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:58,214
<i>Recompense for my pain</i>

381
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:02,158
<i>Is my perseverance</i>

382
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:07,746
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

383
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,548
Very sad...

384
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:12,673
But as the Lord wills...

385
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,047
May He protect us all...

386
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,873
Amen.

387
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,770
By the way, I don't see M. Alam around?

388
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,617
I would've met him if he were around.

389
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,230
Something came up and he had to go...

390
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,359
He'll be late.

391
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,224
Don't worry about the factory.

392
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:37,993
We'll take care of everything in your absence.

393
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,446
Thank you.

394
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,241
Yes?

395
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:08,229
Where's Alam?

396
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,292
Why are you asking?

397
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:13,400
I saw Alam's car here in Murree.

398
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,103
Alam's car... In Murree?

399
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:15,997
Yes.

400
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:17,429
And he was in the car.

401
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:19,481
With another man.

402
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:22,153
How can that be?

403
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,231
He'd just left to do something --

404
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,030
And I even asked him. He said he'll be in Islamabad.

405
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,824
I wouldn't lie to you like that.

406
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:34,110
I was a bit surprised too.

407
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,682
Well... I may've been...

408
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:40,197
Mistaken, maybe?

409
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:43,398
Might've been someone else.

410
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:47,177
Alright, I'll be coming there.

411
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,538
Okay.

412
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:50,170
Bye.

413
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,010
Nobody must hear a thing. Don't tell anyone, okay?

414
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,910
C'mon, now.
-They'll take me with them. I won't --

415
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,480
Please -- Let go --
-Come!

416
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,096
Dad!

417
00:31:19,096 --> 00:31:25,230
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

418
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:31,330
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

419
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,660
I'll end all your sorrows.
<i>Have rained all night</i>

420
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,190
I'll give you the respect and honour...
<i>Have rained all night</i>

421
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,370
Which is why I...
<i>Have rained all night</i>

422
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,220
...That you truly deserve.
<i>Have rained all night</i>

423
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,340
...Divorce Meryem.
<i>Have rained all night</i>

424
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,319
...Divorce Meryem.
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

425
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:56,668
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

426
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>My Master...</i>

427
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:38,560
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

428
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:56,100
<i>My Master...</i>

429
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,440
Stop right there.

430
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,728
Not one step forward.

431
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,049
Meryem, M. Alam's apologising to you...

432
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,427
I know

433
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:20,014
He's here to apologise.

434
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:26,860
Apologise for murdering my parents...

435
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,957
Calling me a chippy before everyone...

436
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:39,364
For marrying me and divorcing me two days later, all to exact his revenge...

437
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:42,960
And for who knows what else!

438
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,063
Innit?

439
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,883
Right.

440
00:33:57,544 --> 00:34:00,947
That's it, right?

441
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,654
Yes...

442
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:12,737
I asked you to stop right there!

443
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,392
I...

444
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,131
I have no complaints...

445
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,628
For all that I did --
-You don't need to remind me...

446
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:42,023
The memories are still green...

447
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,942
I've wronged you, Meryem...

448
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,437
I'm tormented...

449
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,774
Please... Forgive me...

450
00:34:57,851 --> 00:35:01,793
He doesn't even know how to apologise!

451
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,696
How can I forgive you so easily?

452
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,632
What do you mean, Meryem?

453
00:35:12,632 --> 00:35:16,756
That he beg forgiveness

454
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:20,444
Like a sinner ought to.

455
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:23,882
I'll do what you say...

456
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:27,082
Please, forgive me.

457
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:31,748
Down on your knees...

458
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:38,250
And say after me, begging with your hands folded...

459
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,673
What are you saying, Meryem?

460
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,116
I don't mind one bit.

461
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:57,760
Say,

462
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,732
'I've wronged you, Meryem'.

463
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,906
I...

464
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,382
I've wronged you, Meryem...

465
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:13,704
'And all that happened to my sister'

466
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,925
'Was the punishment the Lord ordained for me'.

467
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:23,177
And all that happened to my sister...

468
00:36:23,177 --> 00:36:27,505
Was the punishment the Lord ordained for me...

469
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,322
'Now that I've suffered every punishment the Lord meted out to me',

470
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:39,602
'I beg you - please, forgive me, Meryem'.

471
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:43,260
Now that I've suffered every punishment...

472
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:50,730
The Lord meted out to me...

473
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,085
I beg you -- Please -- forgive me, Meryem...

474
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:17,761
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

475
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:19,885
Go, Jan'e Alam!

476
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:23,110
Meryem forgives you!

477
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,356
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

478
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,550
I...
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

479
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,020
I forgive you!
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

480
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,134
I forgive you!
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

481
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:33,760
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

482
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,026
Malik...

483
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:36,184
Malik...
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

484
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:38,348
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

485
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:41,000
Did you hear that, Malik?
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

486
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,626
Did you hear that, Malik?
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

487
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:47,010
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

488
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:49,900
Did she just forgive me?
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

489
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,570
Meryem forgave Jan'e Alam!
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

490
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,923
She forgave me...
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

491
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:57,140
Forgave me...
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

492
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,980
<i>It ruins its life</i>

493
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,748
Forgave --
<i>It ruins its life</i>

494
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:03,950
<i>It ruins its life</i>

495
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,940
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

496
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,000
Meryem forgave me...
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

497
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>
