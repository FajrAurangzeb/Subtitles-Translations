1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,504
A thing remains alluring

2
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:07,871
<i>Every bit of mine afflicted</i>

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,881
Only as long as it remains distant.

4
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:14,041
<i>With this eldritch malaise,</i>

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,511
Instead of lifting the burden off my daughter's shoulders,

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:11,983
I find myself reduced to my daughter's burden.

7
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:14,091
Ask your sister

8
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:20,266
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

9
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:19,341
How invaluable and priceless honour is to a girl.

10
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:23,612
You've ruined their lives for but a few bucks!

11
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:25,072
<i>O Lord!</i>

12
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:31,643
<i>Decide my fate</i>

13
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:37,998
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

14
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,193
What is a woman's greatest weakness?

15
00:00:35,955 --> 00:00:37,534
Love...

16
00:00:42,689 --> 00:00:45,351
Kill me, please! Kill me!

17
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:48,322
<i>Amidst shards of dreams</i>

18
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:51,331
<i>A rough and repugnant slumber</i>

19
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:57,252
<i>Weighing down on my eyes</i>

20
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:00,552
<i>Both restless and unsettled</i>

21
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:00,612
Erum!

22
00:01:00,552 --> 00:01:03,466
<i>I might die of them</i>

23
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:08,543
<i>Your truthful treacheries</i>

24
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,417
Leave me! I want to go home!

25
00:01:08,543 --> 00:01:11,507
<i>All that you have done</i>

26
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:14,556
<i>You know it in your heart</i>

27
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:20,807
<i>Watch, now, as God makes his move</i>

28
00:01:15,683 --> 00:01:18,633
He was lying -- Dad's n -- Mum! 

29
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:26,888
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

30
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,788
Let go of me!

31
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,679
What happened, Dad?

32
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:32,988
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,019
If someone's sacrificed everything for you, it reflects the intensity of her love.

34
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:37,986
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

35
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:35,539
But one who lost her heart to me so easily can, someday,

36
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:38,489
Lose her heart to anybody else.

37
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:44,539
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>
