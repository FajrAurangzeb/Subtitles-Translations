1
00:00:00,886 --> 00:00:05,391
I didn't expect this from you, Meryem.

2
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:10,252
You didn't behave well with Mr Alam.

3
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:15,449
He'd come to your place to ask forgiveness.

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,952
And when you were ready to forgive him on my insistence

5
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:24,921
Why was all of this necessary?

6
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:29,308
You're complaining to me?

7
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,789
What did you want?

8
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,536
That I treat show my hospitality and cordiality towards him?

9
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:41,476
Beat drums on the occasion of his gracing us with his presence, or

10
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:45,866
Shower flowers on him as he walked in?

11
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:48,832
No...

12
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:53,510
I don't have so kind a heart.

13
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,140
Whatever happened to his sister

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,229
Had nothing to do with me.

15
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:08,669
God has had him reap the reward

16
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,799
Of the seed of hatred he had sown.

17
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,819
He has gone through his share of the punishment.

18
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,570
You shouldn't have insulted him like this.

19
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,569
Insult?

20
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:26,436
Were it not for your sake,

21
00:01:26,436 --> 00:01:31,762
I would never have forgiven in this life

22
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:34,443
That wretched man for ruining my life

23
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:39,076
And snatching from me my parents.

24
00:01:39,076 --> 00:01:42,679
On Judgement Day, in God's own court,

25
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:45,589
I would've grabbed him by the collar,

26
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:48,294
And pleaded before God

27
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:52,351
To give him the harshest punishment.

28
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,369
But

29
00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:00,499
You have stopped me from despising him.

30
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:08,535
Go, Jan'e Alam!

31
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:12,147
Meryem forgives you!

32
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:15,786
I forgive you!

33
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,898
Thank you, Meryem.

34
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,918
By forgiving me today,

35
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:25,919
You have spared me my life.

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,803
Come in.

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,910
Shani, come here.

38
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,039
Sorry, mate...

39
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,327
Something came up, and I had to leave.

40
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,824
All the burden must've fallen on you.

41
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:57,772
It's okay.

42
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,887
So, did everything go well?

43
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,709
The 'something' that came up?

44
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,690
Yes...

45
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,830
Everything's been done today, at long last...

46
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:28,245
Although I didn't expect it to be so easy...

47
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:33,250
Perhaps Mum's prayers have had their effect...

48
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,643
They've made this impossible task

49
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:40,021
So easy.
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

50
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,410
Yes.
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

51
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,540
It was Mum's prayers

52
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,940
It was Mum's prayers
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,290
That
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

54
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,310
Got us where we are.
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

55
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,170
But now,

56
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,410
She's no longer with us.
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

57
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,980
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

58
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,220
Her prayers

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,080
Could stop every trouble coming for us,

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,490
Could stop every trouble coming for us,
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

61
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,900
But now, we've got to face them all.
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

62
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,470
<i>My Master...</i>

63
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,680
No, Shani...
<i>My Master...</i>

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,350
<i>My Master...</i>

65
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,240
Mum may not be with us,
<i>My Master...</i>

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,421
But she's not so distant either.
<i>My Master...</i>

67
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,885
Her memories
<i>My Master...</i>

68
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:30,880
Live in our hearts forever.

69
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,880
Live in our hearts forever.
<i>My Master...</i>

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,606
Forever.
<i>My Master...</i>

71
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:48,048
<i>My Master...</i>

72
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,358
You'd gone to Murree?

73
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:04,959
Yes, I'd --

74
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,654
Gone there, who told you?

75
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:11,286
Khurram told me.

76
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:14,091
He saw you there.

77
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,981
Oh --

78
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,572
I'd gone to drop Malik.

79
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:22,049
He lives there.

80
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:25,791
Alright... So that was it.

81
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:29,375
When did he shift there?

82
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:34,585
It's been a few days since he shifted to Murree from Karachi.

83
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,162
Okay.

84
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:39,712
You could've asked me; I'd have dropped him.

85
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:43,212
Or sent the driver.
-No way, mate.

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,668
It was the least a friend could do.

87
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,031
Thank you.

88
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:51,409
Get some sleep; it's late.

89
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:55,406
The day must've tired you.

90
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,960
<i>Fear a trothful heart</i>

91
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,290
<i>Do nothing malapert</i>

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,300
<i>Its beats</i>

93
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,890
<i>Never trample underfoot</i>

94
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,490
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

95
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,280
You should get some rest too.
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,640
<i>Are shivered into shards by it</i>

97
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,880
<i>For this heart is not merely a heart</i>

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,570
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

99
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,820
<i>Love was a debt unto you</i>

100
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,220
<i>To return it was an obligation unto you</i>

101
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:44,741
What happened? What are you thinking?

102
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,932
Nothing, mate...

103
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:56,665
Did Meryem call or message you to convey her condolences?

104
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,867
She sent in a message.

105
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:06,092
But not her condolences.

106
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,400
What, then?

107
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,118
She doesn't want to marry me.

108
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,917
What?

109
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:19,337
But she'd agreed to it. What happened?

110
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:21,561
No idea, mate...

111
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:27,757
Strange. If she didn't want to marry, why did she agree to it?

112
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,324
You'd taken Aunt to meet her,

113
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:36,259
Perhaps that may explain why she refused?

114
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,493
What do you mean?

115
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:42,130
Perhaps Aunt had said something that she didn't take nicely?

116
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:44,324
No way --

117
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,791
Nothing like it...

118
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,576
She didn't say any such thing.

119
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,807
In fact,

120
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:54,514
Mum liked Meryem very much; she was chuffed to meet her.

121
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:59,580
I can't imagine why she'd refuse so suddenly, then.

122
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,529
Mum had

123
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:11,232
Taken Meryem to another room to talk about something.

124
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,001
What?

125
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:14,909
I don't know, I

126
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:18,001
Was sitting outside.

127
00:08:18,904 --> 00:08:22,299
Perhaps it was then...

128
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:25,198
But no,

129
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:27,386
If it had been something then,

130
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:29,368
Meryem would've reacted to it

131
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,171
When she came back.

132
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,065
But she was normal.

133
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:37,240
Perhaps Meryem didn't want to show it to you,

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,736
But something might've been said then,

135
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,823
Which made Meryem reject your proposal.

136
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:46,704
No, I don't think so...

137
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:51,013
If Mum had wanted to say no,

138
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,426
She'd have said so before me.

139
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:56,172
I wouldn't have questioned her decision.

140
00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:00,263
Perhaps Aunt didn't want to hurt you?

141
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:05,205
So, she said something to Meryem so that she would say no instead.

142
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:06,678
Anyway, leave it.

143
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,526
Don't get yourself all worried.

144
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,989
Ask her when you meet her.

145
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:14,250
Resolve this matter.

146
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,790
No, mate...

147
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,771
I've blandished and pleaded to her as much as I could.

148
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,511
I can't convince her now.

149
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:30,846
But at least talk to her once --
-No. That's enough.

150
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:34,215
I've taken my decision,

151
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:39,247
And I don't want to think about it too much now.

152
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:52,353
Thank you, Hammad,

153
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:55,095
For standing by us in these trying times.

154
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,712
What are you saying!

155
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:00,259
I'm not an outsider.

156
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,338
Right.

157
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,309
You're family now.

158
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,511
Have your dinner.

159
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,057
What happened, Shani? Is everything alright?

160
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,400
Yeah. All good.

161
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,558
Why are you so quiet? Have your dinner.

162
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,185
Yes --

163
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:28,753
I've decided

164
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:33,307
After Mum's fourth [end of mourning], I'll get you married.

165
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,203
What?

166
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,143
Shani's marriage?

167
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,172
But --

168
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,984
To whom?

169
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:41,735
There's a girl

170
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,763
That Monsieur here likes.

171
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:45,438
To her.

172
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:46,818
Shani?

173
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:50,536
Why didn't you tell me?

174
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,590
No...

175
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,700
It's nothing like that.

176
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,720
And I'm in no mood to get married right now.

177
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,465
What happened to him?

178
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:11,451
No idea.

179
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,611
<i>You destroyed, piece by piece,</i>

180
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:25,601
<i>All my hopes and dreams</i>

181
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,431
<i>In but a moment</i>

182
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:31,540
<i>Shattered my heart into pieces</i>

183
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,398
<i>From you, I got</i>

184
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:37,536
<i>Nothing but such contumelies</i>

185
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:40,366
<i>As those that left on me</i>

186
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,095
<i>Ineradicable smirches</i>

187
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:46,036
<i>My love bears witness</i>

188
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:49,084
<i>Listen, my duplicitous dear,</i>

189
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:56,084
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

190
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,554
What's the matter, Shani? What happened?

191
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:05,911
Nothing.

192
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,237
Something's not right.

193
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:14,470
Why are you so suddenly refusing to marry

194
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,842
The girl you'd wanted to marry?

195
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,767
I'm not interested.

196
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:36,263
What do you mean, you're not interested?

197
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:37,735
There must be a reason for this.

198
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:40,016
What happened?

199
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:47,911
You cannot avoid me like this, Shani.

200
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,688
Tell me what has happened.

201
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:54,614
Why are you rejecting the girl

202
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:58,127
Whom you were so eager to get married to just until yesterday?

203
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,898
She's rejected the proposal; I have not.

204
00:13:00,898 --> 00:13:02,523
What?

205
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:04,299
Yes.

206
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,231
She sent in a text

207
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,390
That she doesn't want to marry me.

208
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,060
But why? There must be a reason.

209
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:17,805
I don't know.

210
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:21,426
Then ask her, know the reason from her.

211
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,310
I would have, sure.

212
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,058
If, at the very least, she'd conveyed her condolences at Mum's death.

213
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:37,043
All my friends came to convey their condolences, and those who didn't called to excuse themselves.

214
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:38,306
But

215
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,774
She didn't think for once

216
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:43,869
That she should convey her condolences?

217
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:51,009
What kind of a life partner will be one who's not even with me in this great sorrow of my life?

218
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:59,024
She may have some problem of her own...

219
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,287
Yes.

220
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,927
She does have a problem.

221
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,262
Her problem's that she's raving mad.

222
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,005
She's insane.

223
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:22,417
What have I not done for her?

224
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,436
But she thinks I'm characterless.

225
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:29,495
I want to marry her; that's why I took Mum to meet her.

226
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,500
You had said she

227
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,703
Loves you?

228
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,983
I was mistaken!

229
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,421
I was wrong to have trusted her.

230
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,359
Shani, this is no way to start this journey.

231
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,163
Give each other some time,

232
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:48,520
It ain't no joke, mate.

233
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,570
Saying yes today and no tomorrow.

234
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,002
That's what I'm saying.

235
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:57,025
But who'll tell her?

236
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,223
Don't worry.

237
00:15:03,008 --> 00:15:05,854
Take me to her tomorrow.

238
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:09,076
I'll explain to her; I'll talk to her for you.

239
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,715
No; there is no need. I've decided now.

240
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:13,728
Shani?

241
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:17,974
I'm your elder brother.

242
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,745
Had it been Mum in my place,

243
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:25,195
She'd have gone to her to talk about it for you.

244
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:29,613
Do you know... Mum liked her very much.

245
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:33,318
Who told you?

246
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:35,815
She said it herself.

247
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:44,589
I had a conversation over the phone with her the night she was coming back from your place.

248
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,673
She was delighted, she had

249
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:50,090
Liked the girl very much.

250
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,160
But that --
-Shani, I'm your elder brother.

251
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,275
I'll never think of something that's bad for you.

252
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:01,836
Take me to her tomorrow

253
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,504
And I'll talk to her for you.

254
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:07,885
Get some sleep; it's getting late.

255
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:21,009
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

256
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:27,350
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

257
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:32,125
<i>O Lord</i>

258
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:38,775
<i>Decide my fate</i>

259
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:45,226
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

260
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:49,749
Here we are! Come.

261
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,676
She lives here?

262
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,290
Yes.

263
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,550
She lives here.

264
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,160
Meryem.

265
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,420
Meryem.
<i>My Master...</i>

266
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,600
<i>My Master...</i>

267
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,180
Shall we?
<i>My Master...</i>

268
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,850
Hold!
<i>My Master...</i>

269
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,150
<i>My Master...</i>

270
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,520
What happened?
<i>My Master...</i>

271
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,980
Come on.

272
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,180
You're so anxious as if we're bringing your proposal.
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

273
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,920
We've come for mine.
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

274
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,410
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

275
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,250
C'mon.

276
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,160
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

277
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,840
Your tea.

278
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:35,241
Have your tea; I'll see.

279
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:39,605
Who is it?

280
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,890
Who is it?

281
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:56,790
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

282
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,280
<i>It ruins its life</i>

283
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,580
Someone wants to meet you.
<i>It ruins its life</i>

284
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,990
Someone wants to meet you.
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

285
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,290
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

286
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,150
Come.
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

287
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,858
<i>O Lord! Sap away my life</i>

288
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,470
<i>My Master...</i>

289
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:44,780
<i>Master...</i>

290
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,280
Will you -- keep us waiting here or let us in?

291
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,030
Who is it, Meryem?

292
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,924
I'm Malik.

293
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,839
Malik who?

294
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,073
He's an old friend.

295
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:30,329
P -- please, come in.

296
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,080
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

297
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,950
<i>Have rained all night</i>

298
00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:06,190
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

299
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,770
Sit.
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

300
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,400
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

301
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

302
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,420
<i>The wrath of the Heavens</i>

303
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,400
<i>Obloquies yours</i>

304
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,390
<i>Shall resound in this world</i>

305
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,390
<i>Ashes yours</i>

306
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,410
<i>Shall be blown away with the winds</i>

307
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,370
<i>Dead ends shall you find</i>

308
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,710
<i>In your room in every heart</i>

309
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,650
<i>Recompense for my pain</i>

310
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,710
<i>Is my perseverance</i>

311
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,640
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

312
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
Meryem, get some tea for our guests...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

313
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,700
Meryem, get some tea for our guests...
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

314
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,990
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

315
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,180
Isn't he the same friend

316
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,966
Who'd come to pay a visit the other day?

317
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,079
He's my brother.

318
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,022
Released from prison just a few days ago.

319
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,449
Brother...
-Yes --?

320
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:02,003
You'd come here to talk about something --

321
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,581
I -- What?

322
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:13,523
About... My marriage?

323
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,510
Yes...

324
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,060
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

325
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,990
Talk -- to whom?
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

326
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,590
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

327
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,610
What do you mean, talk to whom?
<i>This heart is its own nemesis</i>

328
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,100
You'd come to talk to Meryem, of course.

329
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,970
You'd come to talk to Meryem, of course.
<i>It ruins its life</i>

330
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,660
<i>It ruins its life</i>

331
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Now that Meryem's brother is with us...
<i>It ruins its life</i>

332
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,620
Now that Meryem's brother is with us...

333
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,918
Malik, I --

334
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:53,293
I wanted to ask if you'd --

335
00:23:03,314 --> 00:23:05,822
If you'd --

336
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:10,883
Give my brother your sister's hand in matrimony...

337
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:13,222
How strange!

338
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:16,041
You're asking for my hand in marriage?

339
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,837
I've rejected the proposal.

340
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:24,985
Hasn't he told you?

341
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,577
He did.

342
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,025
He told me.

343
00:23:32,698 --> 00:23:34,403
I --

344
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:38,903
I have come here to convince you myself --

345
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:42,469
To think about your decision again.

346
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:45,727
My brother is very good.

347
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,781
He'll keep you happy.

348
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,512
And what do you think?

349
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:55,512
I'd change my decision on your insistence?

350
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,118
Never.

351
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:07,900
I've already told you that I do not want to marry you.

352
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,198
Why do you not understand?

353
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:14,840
I will not marry you.

354
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,495
And this is my final decision.

355
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:22,509
You may please show yourselves out.

356
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,993
We have no interest in a girl like you for him either!

357
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:29,211
Shani, let's go!
-Erum! Sit down!

358
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,747
Erum! I'm asking you to sit down!

359
00:24:30,747 --> 00:24:32,897
Shani, she's not a suitable girl for you.

360
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:38,573
Brother's engagement was broken because of her, and that's why he's still all alone!

361
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:40,972
Tell me

362
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,751
Aren't you the same Meryem?

363
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:46,060
Speak up! Aren't you the same Meryem?

364
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,834
Yes.

365
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,665
I am the same Meryem.

366
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:53,976
There! Did you hear that? I told you!

367
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:55,791
Come, Shani!

368
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,846
Erum!

369
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:58,797
Erum!
<i>My Master...</i>

370
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,314
<i>My Master...</i>

371
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:05,309
You may leave too!

372
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:20,655
I don't know

373
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:25,375
What to apologise to you for...

374
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,660
Perhaps destiny wills it

375
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,220
That I atone for my sins myself.

376
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,620
I'd ruined your life, hadn't I?

377
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,890
Thus it falls on me to rebuild...

378
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,698
Accept my brother...

379
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:10,322
As much I despised you,

380
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:15,072
So much love I have seen in Shani's eyes for you.

381
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:19,651
He's so innocent... He loves you so much.

382
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:25,139
Don't punish my brother for my sins.

383
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,805
Accept my brother...

384
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:44,552
My Master...

385
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,317
You have a problem with me, so --

386
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:47,960
After your marriage, I'll leave for somewhere far away from you.

387
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,902
You'll never see my face again.

388
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,600
But please,

389
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,710
Don't rob my brother of his happiness.

390
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,790
Don't rob my brother of his happiness.
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

391
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,690
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

392
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,700
<i>The wrath of the Heavens</i>

393
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,630
<i>Obloquies yours</i>

394
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,660
<i>Shall resound in this world</i>

395
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,700
<i>Ashes yours</i>

396
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,680
<i>Shall be blown away with the winds</i>

397
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,610
<i>Dead ends shall you find</i>

398
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,490
<i>In your room in every heart</i>

399
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:38,074
If I matter in the very least to you, do not go forth with this marriage!

400
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,068
She's not suitable for you!

401
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:43,144
She'd been blackmailing Jan for so long!

402
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:46,246
Please don't marry her!

403
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,240
What's she saying?

404
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,877
Is it true?

405
00:27:56,807 --> 00:27:58,804
Tell me...

406
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:08,261
She's a very good

407
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,566
And virtuous girl...

408
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:16,072
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

409
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:18,292
Erum, listen to me patiently.

410
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:21,303
Whatever happened in the past

411
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:24,464
Was a misunderstanding.

412
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:26,957
If Shani wants to marry her, let him.

413
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,116
Don't create problems.

414
00:28:29,116 --> 00:28:30,701
What do you mean?

415
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:36,209
Do you mean to say that her accusations against you were true?

416
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,622
What accusations?

417
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,842
What kind of accusations? Would anyone please tell me?

418
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:46,836
So atrocious and disgraceful that they're unutterable!

419
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:50,336
Tell me! Were they true?

420
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:54,420
Tomorrow, Shani's bride will be with us.

421
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,965
Tell me!

422
00:28:55,965 --> 00:29:00,345
And these things will get out and come to asperse you.

423
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:02,807
Why are you silent? Tell me!

424
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:08,189
And I don't want a single finger raised at my son.

425
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,393
Therefore,

426
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:13,420
Consider it my order

427
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,035
That you won't speak of this to anyone. Not even Shani.

428
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:21,556
Say something! Why are you silent?
-No!

429
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,235
N -- No...

430
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:27,798
They --

431
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:29,760
She was just rather gullible --

432
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,065
My enemies had led her astray.

433
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:37,853
That's why she'd said all of that.

434
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:46,567
As your elder brother, I'd advise you

435
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,173
That you should definitely marry her.

436
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,282
She'll keep you happy.

437
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:59,573
She --

438
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:01,698
She's whiter than white.

439
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:04,344
We'll talk when she agrees to...

440
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,731
She will.

441
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:12,076
I've talked to Malik; he said he'd talk to her.

442
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,594
Hopefully, things will turn in your favour...

443
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:20,734
Erum,

444
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:23,595
Find happiness in your brother's happiness.

445
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,620
Don't create problems.

446
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,750
<i>Fear a trothful heart</i>

447
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,760
<i>Do nothing malapert</i>

448
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,490
<i>Its beats</i>

449
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,590
<i>Never trample underfoot</i>

450
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,930
Please, Shani...
<i>Never trample underfoot</i>

451
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,760
She's not worthy of you!
<i>Never trample underfoot</i>

452
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,780
She's not worthy of you!
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

453
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,740
Please don't marry her!
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

454
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,790
<i>Are shivered into shards by it</i>

455
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,750
<i>For this heart is not merely a heart</i>

456
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,100
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

457
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,010
<i>Love was a debt unto you</i>

458
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:07,010
<i>To return it was an obligation unto you</i>

459
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:14,423
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

460
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:17,157
Why must you be so adamant, Meryem?

461
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:21,367
When your destiny knocks to rebuild your life,

462
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:25,379
Why are you kicking it out?

463
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,238
What are you saying?

464
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:33,025
You are asking me to

465
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:37,261
Live at my ex-husband's,

466
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,758
As --

467
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:42,258
His brother's bride, at that?

468
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:43,823
No...

469
00:31:43,823 --> 00:31:46,812
He's said it.

470
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:50,612
He'd be out of your lives.

471
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:56,187
And when Shan finds out?

472
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:57,419
That's his concern.

473
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,049
Let him deal with it.

474
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:01,613
You've not concealed your past from him.

475
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:05,593
He wants to make you his, knowing every bit of it.

476
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,743
Whatever you say,

477
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,938
I'll not listen to you this time.

478
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:12,763
You may not,

479
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:16,200
But I care for your happiness.

480
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:22,558
Like any other brother, I, too, want to see my sister settle down in life.

481
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:26,526
Consider it my request or my command,

482
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:31,699
But if you have the slightest respect and sympathy for me in your heart,

483
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:37,307
If you truly consider me your brother, you will not reject him.

484
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:40,138
Because I'm telling Mr Shan

485
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:40,713
That you've agreed.

486
00:32:40,713 --> 00:32:44,730
That you've agreed.
<i>All that you have done</i>

487
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,697
<i>You know it in your heart</i>

488
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:57,373
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

489
00:32:57,373 --> 00:33:03,111
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

490
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,857
Sir, this is Jan'e Alam speaking.

491
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,020
I would...

492
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,966
I would like to transfer all my property to my brother, Shan'e Alam.

493
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,605
Yes.

494
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:22,323
You may come to my office tomorrow with all the necessary documents.

495
00:33:22,608 --> 00:33:24,568
Thank you.

496
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,779
You're great, mate!

497
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:31,514
You did just what you said!

498
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:33,346
What did I do?

499
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:35,585
Your friend called.

500
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,961
Which friend?

501
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,511
Malik.

502
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:43,952
He called me just now to tell me that he's convinced his sister to marry me!

503
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:47,024
He's convinced Meryem!

504
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:51,168
As always, you've fulfilled this wish of mine!

505
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:54,292
I love you so much, old chap!

506
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:59,187
How could I not?

507
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:02,854
I cannot disappoint you.

508
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,907
But now, you...

509
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:14,784
Need to fulfill a wish of mine.

510
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,724
What wish?

511
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:18,939
Just say the word!

512
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,208
Malik told me

513
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:30,110
How his sister

514
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,235
Has gone through a lot in life.

515
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:36,895
She has suffered a lot.

516
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:44,772
I want you to give her such love

517
00:34:44,772 --> 00:34:48,148
Care for her so much

518
00:34:48,148 --> 00:34:52,315
That she forgets all the bitter memories of her past.

519
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,730
Promise me.

520
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,590
You will give her love,

521
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,190
Care for her,

522
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,630
And give her not an ounce of sorrow.

523
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,000
And give her not an ounce of sorrow.
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

524
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,080
Promise me.
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

525
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,980
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

526
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,660
<i>Have rained all night</i>

527
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,810
I promise.

528
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,620
I promise.
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

529
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,840
I will take good care of her,
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

530
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,140
Give her every bit of happiness,
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

531
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,010
She'll forget every sorrow of her past.
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

532
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,580
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

533
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,580
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

534
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,640
<i>The wrath of the Heavens</i>

535
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,620
<i>Obloquies yours</i>

536
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,212
<i>Shall resound in this world</i>

537
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:11,015
God be praised!

538
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:14,187
My sister looks so wonderful in this gown.

539
00:37:16,593 --> 00:37:20,894
May you be blessed with a lifetime of bliss!

540
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:25,213
May you be safe from every evil eye.

541
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,700
Why are you doing all of this?

542
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,434
For your happiness.

543
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:36,045
And if I said

544
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,763
That I'm not happy?

545
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:44,222
Then I won't believe a word of what you say.

546
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:48,489
Because I know you love Shan'e Alam.

547
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:53,588
You want to turn away from your happiness just because

548
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:56,871
He's Jan'e Alam's brother?

549
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:03,944
Punishing the innocent is a crime in itself.

550
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,271
If Jan'e Alam has been cruel to you,

551
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:10,486
It does not mean

552
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:14,210
That you exact your revenge on Shan'e Alam.

553
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:19,081
Alright, tell me.

554
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:24,643
Would you be happy without Shan'e Alam?

555
00:38:27,383 --> 00:38:29,287
You won't be.

556
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,677
I knew it.

557
00:38:32,254 --> 00:38:35,487
Fortunate are those

558
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:39,969
Who get the life partner of their choice.

559
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,193
Thus, I request,

560
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:48,271
Don't cast a hateful gaze over this moment of jollity.

561
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:52,424
Start your new life with rapture.

562
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:55,084
Now,

563
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:58,437
Would you do as your brother asked?

564
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,580
Smile now, quickly!

565
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,110
Smile!

566
00:39:28,937 --> 00:39:30,854
You're ready?

567
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:32,720
I am.

568
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:35,611
My brother looks like a hero today!

569
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:36,578
Just today?

570
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:38,108
Don't I always?

571
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:40,068
You do.

572
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:43,523
But this coat's got a dazzle befitting a wedding.

573
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,878
Yes.

574
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,923
That's true.

575
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,250
Anyway, take this.

576
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,700
What's this?

577
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:54,633
These

578
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:57,706
Are all your property documents.

579
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,881
Yes, but why are you giving me property documents now?

580
00:40:01,881 --> 00:40:04,499
Because I've transferred all our property

581
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:07,173
Over to you.

582
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,800
Why?

583
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:15,316
I'm worn out now, old chap.

584
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,954
I'm worn out managing all of this.

585
00:40:20,954 --> 00:40:25,255
That is why I want you to take up this responsibility,

586
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,755
So that I can depart in peace.

587
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,985
Depart? Where are you going?

588
00:40:31,985 --> 00:40:34,922
I'm leaving the country.

589
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:37,656
What are you talking about?

590
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:40,847
You'll leave me all alone like this?

591
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm not leaving you all alone.

592
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,582
I'll get you married and then leave.

593
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:46,162
My flight leaves tomorrow morning.

594
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,596
You're not alone now.

595
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,660
This is not right.

596
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,588
Your life partner is with you.

597
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:58,282
You've got a beatific life ahead of you.

598
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:02,837
Alright, no need to get all emotional over it.

599
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,158
Look here.

600
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,098
My brother's getting married today.

601
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:12,831
And I want to see you delighted and nothing less.

602
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:15,300
I can't be happy without you.

603
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,706
Hey! Smile!

604
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:19,303
Shani, I said something.

605
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,488
Shani?

606
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:24,035
I said something to you.

607
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:28,133
That's more like it.

608
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:35,650
<i>My Master...</i>

609
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:41,802
Come quickly; I'll be waiting for you.

610
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:01,908
Meryem Bibi, daughter of Naseer Ahmed,

611
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:04,785
Do you accept your marriage to Shan'e Alam, son of Ahmed Alam,

612
00:42:04,785 --> 00:42:09,085
With a dower of 2,000,000 Rupees?

613
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,646
I accept.

614
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,093
Meryem Bibi, daughter of Naseer Ahmed,

615
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:21,855
Do you accept your marriage to Shan'e Alam, son of Ahmed Alam,

616
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:26,501
With a dower of 2,000,000 Rupees?

617
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:28,947
I accept.

618
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:31,901
Meryem Bibi, daughter of Naseer Ahmed,

619
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:34,765
Do you accept your marriage to Shan'e Alam, son of Ahmed Alam,

620
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:39,095
With a dower of 2,000,000 Rupees?

621
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,123
I accept.

622
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:58,698
I have seen you many times before,

623
00:42:58,698 --> 00:43:04,387
And each time I found you more beauteous than the last.

624
00:43:06,037 --> 00:43:09,653
But I don't know why, today...

625
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:15,117
My heart is on edge...

626
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:21,789
I can't bring myself to look at your face...

627
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:24,829
Why?

628
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:31,076
Perhaps I fear

629
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:35,955
That I may be enslaved by your charm.

630
00:43:38,256 --> 00:43:41,444
To enslave you is something

631
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:44,821
I can never even conceive remotely.

632
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:20,680
I do not know how to praise a lady;

633
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,068
I lack the words to compliment you.

634
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:30,028
But I believe

635
00:44:30,028 --> 00:44:33,508
That every poet's beloved,

636
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:38,504
To whom he sang odes,

637
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:43,635
Would pale before your beauty.

638
00:44:57,797 --> 00:45:01,218
A little something for you.

639
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,010
A little something.

640
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:11,964
I guess I now have the right to give you something now; you can accept it now.

641
00:45:11,964 --> 00:45:17,983
<i>It goes on, goes on</i>

642
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:24,140
<i>This cheeky, puckish life</i>

643
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:30,234
<i>It goes on, goes on</i>

644
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>This cheeky, puckish life</i>

645
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,330
Thank you for entering my life.

646
00:45:50,258 --> 00:45:54,572
Thank you for becoming my life partner.

647
00:46:21,298 --> 00:46:25,306
<i>On you shall descend one day</i>

648
00:46:25,306 --> 00:46:29,396
<i>The wrath of the Heavens</i>

649
00:46:29,396 --> 00:46:33,305
<i>Obloquies yours</i>

650
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:37,291
<i>Shall resound in this world</i>

651
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:41,321
<i>Ashes yours</i>

652
00:46:41,321 --> 00:46:45,279
<i>Shall be blown away with the winds</i>

653
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:49,264
<i>Dead ends shall you find</i>

654
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,647
<i>In your room in every heart</i>

655
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:56,556
<i>Recompense for my pain</i>

656
00:46:56,556 --> 00:47:00,630
<i>Is my perseverance</i>

657
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:08,605
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

658
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,276
Wait. Let me see...

659
00:47:19,368 --> 00:47:20,779
I heard a gunshot!

660
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:21,693
From where?

661
00:47:21,693 --> 00:47:23,551
Upstairs!

662
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,060
Erum!

663
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,031
Brother!

664
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:48,384
Brother -- Brother!

665
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,500
What happened?
-Broth --

666
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,150
No --

667
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,172
What have you done?

668
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:19,460
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

669
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,540
<i>Are shivered into shards by it</i>

670
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,400
<i>For this heart is not merely a heart</i>

671
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,470
No --
<i>For this heart is not merely a heart</i>

672
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,470
What happened --?
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

673
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:30,190
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

674
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:30,800
What have you done --?
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

675
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,290
What have you done --?
<i>Love was a debt unto you</i>

676
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,170
Brother!
<i>Love was a debt unto you</i>

677
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:34,800
What have you done?
<i>Love was a debt unto you</i>

678
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,780
What have you done?
<i>To return it was an obligation unto you</i>

679
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,720
What have you just done?
<i>To return it was an obligation unto you</i>

680
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,970
What have you just done?
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

681
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:42,330
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

682
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,630
What have you done -- I'd said --
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

683
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,200
I'd said my happiness means nothing without you...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes the next move</i>

684
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,620
Nothing!
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

685
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:55,190
<i>It lingers on, lingers on</i>

686
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,360
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

687
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,010
There is no peace left and I grow restless!
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

688
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,160
Do me a favour, Mum...
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

689
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,470
Curse me that I die!

690
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,170
Calm down, my dear...

691
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,520
Calm down, my dear...
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

692
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,200
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

693
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,020
Why did you do this?
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

694
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,550
<i>I have heard the skies</i>

695
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,650
<i>Have rained all night</i>

696
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,960
You have a problem with me, so --
<i>Have rained all night</i>

697
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,460
After your marriage, I'll leave for somewhere far away from you.
<i>Have rained all night</i>

698
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,240
You'll never see my face again.
<i>Have rained all night</i>

699
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,070
You'll never see my face again.
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

700
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,420
Now that I've suffered every punishment
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

701
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,230
The Lord meted out to me,
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

702
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,730
I beg you -- Please -- forgive me, Meryem...
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

703
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,246
<i>But it is that city that has remained athirst</i>

704
00:49:37,246 --> 00:49:41,268
My dear brother Shani,

705
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:46,063
I am confident Meryem would prove to be the best for you,

706
00:49:46,063 --> 00:49:49,551
Which is why I want that you never trouble her,

707
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:52,749
For I have troubled her enough already.

708
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:55,557
I have been very cruel to her.

709
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:59,205
I would have told you any of this in my lifetime,

710
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,221
But Mum's order

711
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:05,656
And the fear of being disgraced in the eyes of all of you

712
00:50:05,656 --> 00:50:08,122
Silenced me.

713
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:12,379
I know you would despise me after reading this letter,

714
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:16,302
But try to forgive this brother of yours,

715
00:50:16,302 --> 00:50:19,620
And if you can, please weep at my death,

716
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,875
Else, my soul would not get any peace.

717
00:50:22,875 --> 00:50:24,750
And one more thing:

718
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,379
There's a photograph on my side table.

719
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:30,886
Many questions would come to your mind when you see it,

720
00:50:30,886 --> 00:50:33,732
And the answers to all your questions

721
00:50:33,732 --> 00:50:35,605
Lie with Meryem,

722
00:50:35,605 --> 00:50:39,439
For she knows well how dastardly I have been.

723
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:43,000
She knows that I was a wicked man.

724
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,350
Keep me in your prayers.

725
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,000
Keep me in your prayers.
<i>Fear a trothful heart</i>

726
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,279
<i>Fear a trothful heart</i>

727
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:52,414
<i>Do nothing malapert</i>

728
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:56,119
<i>Its beats</i>

729
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:00,372
<i>Never trample underfoot</i>

730
00:51:00,372 --> 00:51:04,356
<i>Those who shatter it</i>

731
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:08,385
<i>Are shivered into shards by it</i>

732
00:51:08,385 --> 00:51:12,338
<i>For this heart is not merely a heart</i>

733
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:16,336
<i>It is the abode of God</i>

734
00:51:16,336 --> 00:51:20,353
<i>Ashes yours</i>

735
00:51:20,353 --> 00:51:24,382
<i>Shall be blown away with the winds</i>

736
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:28,319
<i>Dead ends shall you find</i>

737
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,760
<i>In your room in every heart</i>

738
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,794
<i>Recompense for my pain</i>

739
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:39,722
<i>Is my perseverance</i>

740
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:48,291
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

741
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:56,367
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

742
00:51:56,367 --> 00:52:02,006
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

743
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:06,958
You knew Alam was my brother, didn't you?

744
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,670
Yes.

745
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:24,522
Why did you not tell me, then?

746
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:34,208
I was under your mother's oath.

747
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:38,742
She didn't want that you and Erum

748
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:43,119
Should ever come to despise your elder brother.

749
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:51,570
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

750
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:59,554
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

751
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:07,491
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

752
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:15,366
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>
