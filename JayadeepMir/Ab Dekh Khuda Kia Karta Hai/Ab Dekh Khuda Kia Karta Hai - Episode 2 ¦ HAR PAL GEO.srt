1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,316
Prices don't matter when gifting, Miss --

2
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:06,085
Meryem, right?

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:11,116
Gifts make sense when given by your own.

4
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:13,160
But to accept one

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,580
From a stranger doesn't suit me,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,426
Which is why I can't keep it. Thank you.

7
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:20,485
Which is why I can't keep it. Thank you.
-Alright, listen.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,826
I'll take it back, but let me be clear that it displeases me.

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,270
Would you do me a favour?

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,931
What kind of favour?

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,183
If it suits you,

12
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's get coffee sometime?

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,743
Sir?

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,047
What's so surprising about it?

15
00:00:50,047 --> 00:00:52,471
I'm just asking you out for coffee.

16
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:59,507
He gifted you a perfume today; tomorrow, he'll take you out for coffee, and then he'll try to talk to you every now and then.

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,495
I'm sorry, sir.

18
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,736
I'm on duty.

19
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:09,111
Besides, I don't like coffee.

20
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:14,115
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to attend to the customers.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,665
I've found about the popsy, sir.

22
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,130
She comes from a poor family.

23
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:44,270
Lives with her parents.

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,840
Her oul fella's a heart patient. Stays at home.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,311
Her oul wan teaches the Holy Qur'an to the kids.

26
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,560
She and her daughter earn just enough

27
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,831
To make ends meet.

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,486
They're desperately in need.

29
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:12,486
You know what to do.

30
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:14,463
Don't worry, sir.

31
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:16,498
It will be done.

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,041
Mum...

33
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,446
Where'd all the stuff in the kitchen come from?

34
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:59,721
Ah, that -- I was just about to tell you...

35
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,980
A Suzuki had come here with rations.

36
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,175
A certain Malik...

37
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,846
Malik?
-Yes.

38
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:12,138
He said the construction company is distributing rations

39
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:15,153
For the needy.

40
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,373
How did they figure out we're 'needy'?

41
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:22,280
Well, this is a poor neighbourhood.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,920
The rich don't live here.

43
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,455
They're distributing rations to everyone.

44
00:03:27,455 --> 00:03:30,266
You shouldn't have taken it.

45
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,221
We were managing on our own...

46
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,371
Why did you have to accept this charity?

47
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,124
Meryem,

48
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:41,659
Not one in this great bath of poverty is clothed.

49
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,069
What with this tantrum of dignity...

50
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:50,339
They're distributing rations to everyone. What's wrong if I've taken some?

51
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,005
Who knows who they were...

52
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,707
Why they were here...

53
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:59,989
Just some toffs here to distribute rations to the poor.

54
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,142
Did they mention where they were from?

55
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:09,400
You mentioned a construction company. A name, perhaps?

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,981
Yes, he gave his card.

57
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:14,797
I'll get it.

58
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:15,842
And yes,

59
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,596
They also said

60
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:22,327
That the educated can work for their company.

61
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,940
I say, go there.

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,590
It'll save you from this job at the perfume shop.

63
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,382
Perhaps you may get a more respectable job...

64
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,962
I say, go tomorrow.

65
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,550
I can go there to get a job,

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,481
But I'll return this charity to them.

67
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,730
Alright.

68
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,830
I'll get the card.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,506
I'll get the card.
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

70
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:58,753
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

71
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:04,095
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

72
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,773
Good morning.

73
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:15,384
They gave us some rations...

74
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:16,991
We won't be needing it.

75
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,933
We don't accept charity, so...

76
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,921
Please give these to someone in need.

77
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,946
Zakir!

78
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:24,666
Yes, Ma'am?

79
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:28,833
Take this to the warehouse.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,765
Thank you.

81
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:41,945
The people who'd come mentioned they're offering jobs here.

82
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,588
Who do I meet to apply?

83
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:46,225
Jobs?
-Yes.

84
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:50,681
Just a minute, I'll ask Mr Alam and let you know.

85
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,611
This is for you from Mr Jan'e Alam.

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,543
Your name?

87
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:59,336
Meryem.

88
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,803
Miss Meryem's here to apply for a job.

89
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,920
Come.

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,180
What I don't understand is why you're being so generous.

91
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:37,086
I'm not the type

92
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,213
You think I am, sir.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,826
You've embarrassed me...

94
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,704
Yes?

95
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:58,009
Here's the list of all the people we've distributed rations to, sir.

96
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,005
And the two ladies who were here last week?

97
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,340
They seemed rather needy. What about them?

98
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,896
For the moment, we've given them some cash and rations.

99
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,286
Okay. Good.

100
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:15,430
Make sure they get their rations every month.

101
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,909
Okay, sir.

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,166
Sorry...

103
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:30,776
I apologize if I ever came off the wrong way...

104
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:32,228
But alright,

105
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:37,826
Given how we first met, anyone would've thought as you did...

106
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,439
Believe me or not, I had no idea they'd gone to your place with the rations too.

107
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:44,991
No, sir,

108
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,596
It's not your fault.

109
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,700
I'm sorry I misunderstood you...

110
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,636
I doubted your sincerity.
-No issues.

111
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,382
Sometimes, one errs in identifying people for who they are.

112
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:07,379
I almost forgot to ask you - tea or coffee?
-No --

113
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,917
Thank you.

114
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:12,384
I should get going. I'm getting late for my job...

115
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,134
Speaking of which, sir...

116
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,901
I heard you're offering jobs, too?

117
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,879
Where'd you hear that?

118
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,049
I do, yes.

119
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,403
Why?

120
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,760
What are your qualifications?

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,960
I've got a BA.

122
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,490
BA...

123
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:40,770
Alright, drop your CV tomorrow.

124
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,730
I'll see if there's a job here that I can offer you.

125
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,019
Alright, sir.

126
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,971
How much do you earn where you're working?

127
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:49,792
10,000.

128
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,711
That's it?

129
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:56,860
You must be having a hard time.

130
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,086
No, sir, I manag --
-Hold on.

131
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:04,050
Submit your documents here tomorrow.

132
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,408
I'll arrange a job for you with a decent salary.

133
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,042
Thank you, sir.

134
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,660
No problem.

135
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,575
Who was that, Alam?

136
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,386
Who?

137
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,123
Someone in need, of course...

138
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,436
What was she doing here?

139
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:28,225
What do you mean, doing here?

140
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,680
Why would someone in need come to an office?

141
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,527
She was looking for a job.

142
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,094
A job...

143
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:42,810
Intriguing that of all the places in the city,

144
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,936
She should come where there's no vacancy!

145
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,650
You know her, don't you?

146
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,511
Are you raving bonkers?

147
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:56,671
A friend of mine had sent her.

148
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,640
Why does it seem like you're lying, Alam?

149
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,886
You're doubting me?

150
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,757
In my condition, I can't help but doubt...

151
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,910
And I don't know why you're taking my condition so lightly...

152
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,699
And I don't know why you're taking my condition so lightly...
-Jeez --

153
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,276
<i>Who</i>'s taking your condition lightly?

154
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,812
I'm very worried, Noor us-Saba.

155
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,520
I can feel your pain.
-No way, you can't!

156
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,880
If you did, you would've talked to your Mum already.

157
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,836
C'mon, Alam, just try to understand... I get more anxious with each passing moment.

158
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:50,499
I've been so busy at the office -- so much work these days, mate...

159
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,960
I couldn't get time to talk to Mum...

160
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,427
'Busy'!

161
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:59,987
You're too 'busy' to worry about the great mess we're in!

162
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,688
Or is it that you don't <i>want</i> to talk to your Mum?

163
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
You're just staving me off, aren't you?
-Why would I?

164
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,491
Don't I worry for you?

165
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,910
You worry for me, don't you? Here.

166
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:28,417
Right here.

167
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,787
You aren't busy right now, are you?

168
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,830
Call your Mum.

169
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:35,829
Talk to her. Surely, you aren't busy right now.

170
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,508
I'll talk about everything tonight.

171
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,150
No.

172
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,688
Talk right now.

173
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:47,556
I said I'll talk about everything tonight.

174
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,963
Go.

175
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:52,948
Back to your room.

176
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,794
Go!

177
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,839
So, why don't you marry her?

178
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,600
A woman who can get carried away once

179
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,910
Isn't the type one should marry.

180
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:50,598
She got carried away by <i>you</i>.

181
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,511
Yeah...

182
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:57,528
But if she can be carried away by my words,

183
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:01,330
She may get carried away by anyone tomorrow.

184
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,551
And you want me to marry <i>that</i> type!

185
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,861
No.

186
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,063
I wouldn't stoop so low!

187
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,146
'Stoop'...

188
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:18,774
You shouldn't have ruined her life if you didn't intend to marry her at all.

189
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,539
I haven't ruined anyone's life.

190
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:29,209
Everything that happened was mutual. <i>I</i> didn't force her.

191
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:32,488
No woman takes such a big step on her own.

192
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,813
You must've given her some hope...

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Ah, yes, the hopes...

194
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,465
I loved her so much back then...

195
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,495
But I've grown weary of her...

196
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,214
Look at yourself...

197
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:52,838
Dropping in here with a new woman every other day.

198
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,963
Aren't you afraid?

199
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,913
I'm afraid, yes. Very afraid.

200
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:05,151
Of vilification.

201
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,106
<i>My</i> vilification.

202
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:12,573
So you'd toy with others' lives to escape your vilification.

203
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:14,416
I'm not here for your lecture.

204
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,771
Just tell me if you're helping me or not.

205
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,794
This --

206
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,306
This is the last time I'm helping you.

207
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,180
If something like this happens again,

208
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,321
Don't come here.

209
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,523
It's too awkward for me.

210
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,207
Aye, I'll go somewhere else.

211
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:28,971
I'll send her here tomorrow evening.

212
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,911
Take care.

213
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,450
I'm very worried these days, Noor us-Saba...

214
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,695
I tried to talk to Mum about you.

215
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,860
She won't give in...

216
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,176
I don't know what to do...

217
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:10,364
How do I tell her how much I love you?

218
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,090
She'd gladly throw me out, saying,

219
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,998
'Have a great life with her'!

220
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,649
But I won't be able to take it...

221
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,386
I can't go against Mum for you.

222
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:35,180
I love Mum far more than I love you.

223
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,548
I can feel your pain...

224
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,820
I know you're very troubled.

225
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,785
But please forgive me.

226
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,977
I can't help it, mate.

227
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,122
What about my helplessness, Alam?

228
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,454
What about this ugly situation <i>I</i>'m in right now?

229
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,777
I can understand.

230
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,676
I was concerned about you, so...

231
00:17:16,489 --> 00:17:19,879
I've thought of a solution.

232
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,246
What kind of solution?

233
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,776
There's a hospital nearby...

234
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:32,101
Dr Kashif there - he's a friend...

235
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,620
Go and see him tomorrow.

236
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,256
He...

237
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:40,225
Can arrange a lady doctor for you.

238
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,942
Finish this trouble tomorrow.

239
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,521
Gor blimey, Alam!

240
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,974
However did you even imagine --

241
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,925
Alam, it's <i>our</i> child, what's up wi --
-I know, baby...

242
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:04,205
But we don't have another way out.

243
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,998
We'd both be in great trouble.

244
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,670
Just a minute. Here.

245
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,888
I'd had this payment order made. You'll need it.

246
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,761
Here.

247
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,195
Take it.

248
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,870
How rotten and vile, Alam --

249
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,885
What kind of woman do you think I am? I --

250
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,971
Alam, I --

251
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,482
I'm not that type --

252
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,810
I'm an upright woman --

253
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,100
Come again?

254
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,870
Well, baby,

255
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,570
'<i>Upright</i>' women don't live in their boyfriend's flat like this.

256
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,506
So --

257
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,705
You --

258
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:28,781
No way, sweetheart --

259
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:32,781
I'm not thinking anything wrong about you. You're very good.

260
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:36,040
This is hardly the time -- please try to understand.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,100
I don't want to hear anything.

262
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,370
<i>What</i> did you just say about me?

263
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,139
Why must you act like a kid, Noor us-Saba?

264
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,846
At least don't scream like that!

265
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,589
I've tried to convince Mum a lot. What can I do if she's not giving in?

266
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:53,244
She's too conventional.

267
00:19:53,244 --> 00:19:56,651
To her, working women do not make good wives.

268
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:59,825
She's got some oriental girl for me

269
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,830
Who'd do household chores and wears --

270
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,583
I mean, look at what <i>you</i>'re wearing!

271
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,130
How could I even introduce you to her?

272
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,086
Please try to understand my helplessness.

273
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:16,970
If you were so helpless, Alam,

274
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,052
Why did you ruin my life?

275
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,701
<i>I</i> ruined your life?

276
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,480
Why do women forget so quickly?

277
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,509
Know what, Noor us-Saba,

278
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:50,947
I didn't force you.

279
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,968
Nor are you a kid who'd have no idea.

280
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,989
This house,

281
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:59,807
The cars parked outside,

282
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:00,959
The servants,

283
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,210
Your job -

284
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,030
<i>I</i> gave you everything.

285
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,951
You should be thankful to Jan'e Alam.

286
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,320
I have no shortage of women.

287
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,175
For the branded clothes you wear today,

288
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:31,680
The high society life of partying you enjoy -

289
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,470
You ought to be beholden to me.

290
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,223
Who doesn't make mistakes, mate...

291
00:21:39,223 --> 00:21:41,480
I made one, too.

292
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,364
It slipped from my mouth out of frustration...

293
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:46,162
Please try to understand --

294
00:21:46,162 --> 00:21:48,587
I'm very troubled. Helpless.

295
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:51,054
No, Jan'e Alam!

296
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,295
I won't let it happen the way you want it to!

297
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:06,856
You'd <i>have</i> to marry me,

298
00:22:06,856 --> 00:22:15,854
Or I'll scream until everyone hears all that'd happened between us!

299
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,941
It's up to you how you convince your Mum.

300
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,474
So you'd scream and tell the world...

301
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:00,075
<i>You destroyed, piece by piece,</i>

302
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:03,070
<i>All my hopes and dreams</i>

303
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,041
<i>In but a moment</i>

304
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:09,007
<i>Shattered my heart into pieces</i>

305
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,830
<i>From you, I got</i>

306
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,086
<i>Nothing but such contumelies</i>

307
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:17,960
<i>As those that left on me</i>

308
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,561
<i>Ineradicable smirches</i>

309
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>My love bears witness</i>

310
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,590
<i>Listen, my duplicitous dear,</i>

311
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,992
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

312
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:37,202
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

313
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:40,100
You've got a BA...

314
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,915
Yes, sir.

315
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:45,386
Just about average marks...

316
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,845
Do you know how to use MS Office and all?

317
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:52,916
No, sir.

318
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,406
We haven't got a computer, sir...

319
00:23:58,406 --> 00:24:02,954
Our school had one, but I never got a chance...

320
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,779
You'll get your chance now.

321
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:16,345
I'll ask my IT department to train you.

322
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,120
Just give me one chance, sir...

323
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,190
I'll work very hard.

324
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,102
I can learn new things quickly, sir.

325
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,279
That's the spirit.

326
00:24:31,357 --> 00:24:35,118
I'm confident you'd do great, Meryem.

327
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,150
Just remember one thing...

328
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,966
Yes, sir?

329
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:48,059
All that I'll ever ask of you will be for your betterment and mine,

330
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:51,349
And the good of the company.

331
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,569
Everything clear?

332
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,976
A --

333
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,850
And, sir --

334
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:06,020
What'd be my salary?

335
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,086
Ah, yes, I forgot to tell you! Let's see...

336
00:25:10,086 --> 00:25:12,979
30,000 a month.

337
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,005
30,000?

338
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,153
Would you need more?

339
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:19,953
N -- No, sir...

340
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:23,715
30,000 a month would be enough for me.

341
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,975
Splendid. You can start tomorrow.

342
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,485
Thank you so much, sir.

343
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,243
Mum and Dad would be delighted to hear

344
00:25:39,243 --> 00:25:40,945
That I've got the job.

345
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:43,556
They'd bless you.

346
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,011
I'd need all their blessings...

347
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,130
Thank you, sir.

348
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,434
Dad...
-Yes?

349
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,188
Have some of these sweets [good news].

350
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,827
Have some of these sweets [good news].
-Okay.

351
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,540
Guess what, Dad,

352
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,956
I've found a new hope today.

353
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,556
You'll see,

354
00:27:00,556 --> 00:27:04,339
Our troubles would vanish into thin air.

355
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,161
Dad...

356
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,130
One needs just a point

357
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,480
To embark on a journey of hard work.

358
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,040
I've found that point, Dad.

359
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,702
You'll see

360
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:25,683
How I work hard

361
00:27:25,683 --> 00:27:28,291
Day and night.

362
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,826
Don't you always say,

363
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:33,560
'The Lord holds the hardworking dear'.

364
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,580
He'll help me along the way...

365
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,058
The day He helps me,

366
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,025
The times will change for us.

367
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:44,244
What's with the haste, Mum?

368
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:45,713
Haste?

369
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:48,231
You're 35 already.

370
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:50,188
When would you get married if not now?

371
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:52,390
I'm not refusing to get married.

372
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,946
Just find me the kind of girl I like.

373
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:58,070
It's as good as refusing!

374
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,533
Tell me,

375
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:02,641
Where would I find the kind of girl you like?

376
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:05,065
That's your problem, innit?

377
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:07,171
Your job, like every mother's...

378
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:09,647
Alright, then...

379
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,712
I say, find someone for youself over there in Karachi.

380
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:17,366
No, Mum... I don't think it's proper...

381
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,897
Someone's daughter...

382
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:23,329
How could I --

383
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:25,935
With this virtuous innocence,

384
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:28,993
I'm afraid you'll always remain single.

385
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:32,010
You know that innocence is my weakness...

386
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,486
The times have changed, my dear.

387
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,530
Lads these days!

388
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,660
They show up with a girl, saying, 'Say hello to my wife! We've gotten married'.

389
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,736
No, Mum, I'm not like that.

390
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:44,861
You know me.

391
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,639
I would never marry someone who'd leave her family for me.

392
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:54,089
Someone who can leave her family today might as well leave me tomorrow.

393
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:59,415
Okie doke, mate, I got it. I'll find someone for you, but!

394
00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:03,640
You won't say anything when I've found someone.

395
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,301
I wouldn't dare.

396
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:08,349
I just want someone

397
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:10,560
Who's honourable, homely...

398
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,871
And comely.

399
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,804
Okay.

400
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:16,613
Bye.

401
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:19,423
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

402
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,635
Modest, coy, docile... Pure homely material...

403
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,683
What happened, Dad?

404
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:39,812
Aren't you happy that I've got a job?

405
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,248
No?

406
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,811
So why are you so troubled?

407
00:29:44,811 --> 00:29:47,443
I'm just...

408
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:52,855
Troubled at my fate...

409
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,414
I --

410
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,612
Should've been distributing sweets

411
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:03,654
On the occasion of my daughter's espousal...

412
00:30:03,654 --> 00:30:06,982
But instead --

413
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:12,015
Because she's gotten a job...

414
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:17,605
That's why I'm troubled...

415
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,596
Dad...

416
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,986
Your treatment is more important than my espousal.

417
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,726
Get well quickly.

418
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:37,886
You'll get your wish, too.

419
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,450
Meryem,

420
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,500
Isn't 30,000 Rupees

421
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,940
A bit too much?

422
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,910
It's a big company...

423
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,786
Were it not for your Dad's treatment

424
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:58,992
And our present condition,

425
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:02,928
I would never have allowed you to work.

426
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:05,893
But...

427
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,158
I'm helpless...

428
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:13,034
Helplessness is a great fiend

429
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:17,360
That makes you do unimaginable things.

430
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,061
Why are the two of you worrying so much?

431
00:31:20,061 --> 00:31:21,406
And Dad,

432
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,926
It's a good place to be.

433
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:25,436
And Mr Alam...

434
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:29,616
He's a very upright and generous man.

435
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,476
First impressions,

436
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:34,943
My dear,

437
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:38,759
Are hardly enough know a man...

438
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,948
And --

439
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,520
Do other women

440
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,991
Work at your office, too?

441
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,014
Yes, Dad.

442
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,436
Alright...

443
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:55,094
That's good...

444
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,931
You're worrying for no reason.

445
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,915
It's great there.

446
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:01,963
But --

447
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,820
When a poor man's daughter steps out of the house,

448
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,006
His heart grows restless.

449
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:17,273
Forget these fears.

450
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,213
Just pray for me...

451
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:24,481
That I do well on this job.

452
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,713
May you live long.

453
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,544
May you live long.

454
00:32:28,544 --> 00:32:31,390
May the Lord bless you with good fortune.

455
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,935
Amen.

456
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,405
Dad...

457
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,510
I'll get some water.

458
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,039
Jan'e Alam!

459
00:32:56,497 --> 00:32:58,143
What's this? Barging into my office like that!

460
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,940
Why aren't you answering my phone?

461
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,296
Keep your voice down.

462
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,690
Down!

463
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,971
My office isn't your home.

464
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,170
No need to create a scene here.

465
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,860
Get going.

466
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,639
I'm not here to create a scene.

467
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:18,336
I've come to get the answer to my question - when are you marrying me?

468
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,108
Go. I'll be coming over tonight. We can talk.

469
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:27,367
I'm not going home.

470
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:30,613
I need my answer <i>right now</i>.

471
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,783
How do I tell you, Noor us-Saba?

472
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,435
You don't seem to understand...

473
00:33:54,575 --> 00:34:00,090
Noor us-Saba, I don't want anyone in this office to hear about it...

474
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,776
I'm not worried about myself.

475
00:34:06,263 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm worried about your honour.

476
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,615
I worry about you a lot. I really love you.

477
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,060
If someone pointed a finger at you,

478
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,234
It would drive me really furious.

479
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,495
Go home, I'll be coming tonight.

480
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:30,507
We can talk at length and work something out.

481
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,868
Look at the kind of man you are!

482
00:34:45,025 --> 00:34:48,325
Changing colours every moment.

483
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,210
Your romantic self

484
00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:02,670
Can make hearts of stone melt,

485
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,650
And your stranger self

486
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:13,571
Can make the dearest think again if they'd ever actually met you...

487
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:14,770
Don't worry.

488
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,008
I'm with you.

489
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:21,829
Don't create a spectacle of yourself for everyone to watch.

490
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:25,118
Go.

491
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:27,289
I'll be there tonight.

492
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:19,410
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

493
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:25,901
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

494
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:30,706
<i>O Lord</i>

495
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:37,380
<i>Decide my fate</i>

496
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,103
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

497
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,351
Look at yourself...

498
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,941
What happened?

499
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:58,366
You're looking at my heart's condition...

500
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:07,364
In one of its dark and lonely corners lies shattered a promise you'd once made...

501
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,200
And shards of all the dreams

502
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,169
Of my life with you lie scattered...

503
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,910
My tears...

504
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:29,979
My tears descend from my eyes onto my heart...

505
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,526
Did you take the pill?

506
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,869
Know what, Noor us-Saba, such is life...

507
00:37:40,203 --> 00:37:43,446
It has its ups and downs.

508
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,121
Sometimes,

509
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:49,071
One's got to be like stone, and sometimes like wax...

510
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,543
That's the way it is...

511
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,670
You've grown weary of me, haven't you, Alam?

512
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:06,410
You're after the lass who'd come to your office the other day, aren't you?

513
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,213
Who?

514
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,626
You'd sweet talk your way right into her heart --

515
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:14,481
'Sweet talk'?

516
00:38:14,481 --> 00:38:16,348
Look at me. Here.

517
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:18,016
Noor us-Saba?

518
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:19,201
Here.

519
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,046
There's nothing like that.

520
00:38:21,046 --> 00:38:24,000
Nobody can take your place in my life.

521
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,525
You're lying!
-I'm lying?

522
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:29,816
Have I ever lied to you?

523
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,420
If you were telling the truth, you would've talked to your Mum.

524
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,000
How can I believe that so powerful a man can be so helpless?

525
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,040
How can I believe that so powerful a man can be so helpless?

526
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,000
I did.
