1
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:25,706
Hello. I've got some imported tea for you.

2
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,687
This small one's for 150; the large one's for 250.

3
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,187
Ma'am --

4
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:33,957
Would you like some of this tea?

5
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,886
That would be enough!

6
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,340
It's the third week in succession,

7
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,390
And you've gotten us no sales at all!

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,740
Consider this a final warning.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,036
If you return empty-handed,

10
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:05,286
Consider yourself dismissed.

11
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:07,260
Yes, sir...

12
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,797
'Yes, sir' won't do. I want sales, you get it?

13
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,546
I have to listen to my superiors because of folks like you.

14
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:17,916
Such fairness!

15
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,776
It is <i>your</i> performance that's abysmal,</i>

16
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:23,837
And I have to listen to whatever the seniors say!

17
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:26,616
I have to bear their insults!

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,212
What are you looking at, standing here like this? Go!

19
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:39,242
And bring some good news today, alright?

20
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,502
Yes...

21
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
'Islamabad'

22
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,616
Good morning, sir.

23
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,580
If it isn't Alam!

24
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,506
Hello!

25
00:02:57,506 --> 00:02:58,780
Hello, how are you?

26
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,156
I'm fine.

27
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:03,173
Where's everyone? I don't see them around...

28
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:11,717
These loving hands can only be my little doll's.

29
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,417
It's not fair...

30
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:16,247
You recognised me again.

31
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,528
I can recognise my doll in my sleep.

32
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,019
Because nobody else can play around with me like that.

33
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:22,828
Where's Mum?

34
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:27,508
Don't spoil her with your love like that!

35
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,680
How are you?

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,910
Great.

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,562
Long time no see.

38
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,066
Yes, I've been a bit busy.

39
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:37,563
The city of Karachi has snatched my brother from me...

40
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:40,850
But the city of Karachi has made our business flourish too...

41
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,086
As they say,

42
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:45,047
'Nothing sacrificed, nothing gained'.

43
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:47,356
Will we stay standing here, talking all day?

44
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:49,446
I mean -- I'm starving.

45
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,200
Starving the moment you arrived?

46
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,160
Nasrin, come; let's get him something.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,300
I'm coming from my room.

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,965
Okay.

49
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:57,560
Where are you going? Tell me what you've brought for me.

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,601
Quite the haul; come!

51
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,806
Good morning, sir.

52
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:11,636
Yes?

53
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,236
Sir, I'm selling this tea.

54
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,746
It's imported.

55
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:17,360
Try this tea for once, I'm sure you'd love it.

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,356
I'm fed up of your lot!

57
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:22,937
Trust a new salesgirl to show up every day selling something --

58
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,810
We've got such a stockpile, and my wife's such a fool --

59
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,310
She buys every bloomin' thing.

60
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,806
It's very good, sir. Imported.

61
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:33,086
Check out the aroma, it's enchanting.

62
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,356
The little one's for 150, the larger one for 250.

63
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,647
I can even give you a discount if you buy it in bulk.

64
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:39,820
Can I have a demo?

65
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,966
Yes, sir.

66
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:42,210
Come inside.

67
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,250
Sir -- ?

68
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,690
Come.

69
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,036
Yes.

70
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,266
The Karachi villa ain't this lively.

71
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,491
The residents make a house a home.

72
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,400
Of course.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,666
And where bachelors like me live

74
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,147
Is more accurately a hostel.

75
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,427
And

76
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:09,978
What about that little job that worried you?

77
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:12,520
You'd even offered a tender; has it been accepted?

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,160
How couldn't it be?

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,396
I'd asked you to pray that it is.

80
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,426
Yes, dear.

81
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:22,278
It's all about blessings...

82
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:25,439
Else, our kind, and this luxury...

83
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,526
Please call Ma'am.

84
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:36,237
What's the need?

85
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:37,840
Make a cup yourself.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,970
You'd said you'd give a demo.

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,741
Sir, I can't make --

88
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,031
If you don't want to give a demo...

89
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:50,872
No, sir -- I can make tea.

90
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:51,591
Alright.

91
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,622
The kitchen's on the right side.

92
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,136
Consider this a final warning.

93
00:05:59,136 --> 00:06:01,356
If you return empty-handed,

94
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,179
Consider yourself dismissed.

95
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,466
Nasrin,

96
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,754
I'd much rather you serve water with ice.

97
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:22,313
What happened?

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,980
Why are you crying?

99
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,541
Is it something someone said?

100
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,790
This, sir. Ashraf pesters me with his calls everyday.

101
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,926
He even calls me at 1 a.m.

102
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,746
Nasrin, is this the time to complain? We're having lunch.

103
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:55,669
Excuse me.

104
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,336
Where are you going? Have your food.

105
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,366
It's my responsibility, Mum. Please.

106
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,006
Come with me.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,288
Couldn't she have found a better moment?

108
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,900
Ashraf!

109
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,511
Ashraf!

110
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,590
Over here.

111
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,566
Yes sir?

112
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:33,736
You're pestering Nasrin with your calls, eh?

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,910
No, si --

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,116
Tell me the truth

115
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:42,958
Because if I caught you lying,

116
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,449
I won't spare you.

117
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,879
Sir, I swear --

118
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,579
She's lying -- I'm not --

119
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:57,529
I can swear on it, Alam -- He calls me repeatedly and says, 'Let's be friends'.

120
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,006
So you want to be friends!

121
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,476
No, sir --

122
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,610
S -- Sir, I don't even --

123
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,901
S -- Sir, I don't even -- talk face-to-face with her --

124
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:16,040
S -- Sir, I don't even -- talk face-to-face with her -- It's not --

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,026
Where's your phone?

126
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,261
At home, sir...

127
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,841
Is it?

128
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,010
Give me your phone.

129
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,160
Which one's his number?

130
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,066
Which one's his number?
-This one.

131
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,171
Here.

132
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,970
Sir -- I made a mistake, forgi --

133
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,490
It was a mistake, sir --

134
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,970
It was a mistake, sir --
-Hands away!

135
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,980
I won't do it again -- Sir -- It was a mistake --

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,400
What do you think?

137
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,270
You'd pester an innocent girl and I'll forgive you?

138
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,060
Guards!

139
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,870
Sir -- it was a mistake --

140
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,200
Throw him out!

141
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,298
Break his legs if he comes near this house again!

142
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,670
A mistake -- sir --

143
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,982
Sir -- I won't do it again --

144
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:22,176
Just -- A mistake --

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,936
Thank you.

146
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,646
It's nothing...

147
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:35,196
You're our responsibility.

148
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:39,306
Your honour matters as much as Erum's to me.

149
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,357
Go, now.

150
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,450
Sir, if -- Ma'am's around, please ask her to come.

151
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,806
'Ma'am'?

152
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,400
'Ma'am' who?

153
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,020
Ain't no 'Ma'am' 'ere,

154
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,730
I live here by meself.

155
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,970
No, you'd just said that Ma'am --

156
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,396
Ain't no 'Ma'am' 'ere;

157
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,610
Just me all by meself.

158
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,236
Just me.

159
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,796
What?

160
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,023
How say you come 'ere everyday?

161
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,880
I will pay you lots

162
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,360
And purchase all your tea.

163
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,240
Sir -- no --

164
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,396
You're -- It's j --

165
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:58,120
Call Ma'am...

166
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,830
Ain't no 'Ma'am' around.

167
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,906
Just me.

168
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,220
Ma'am!

169
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,370
Nothing --

170
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,089
Help --

171
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,146
Sorry...

172
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,130
I'd given you a final warning.

173
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,280
But you've crossed all limits today.

174
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,380
If you could manage to escape, why did you leave your bags there?

175
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,541
Sir -- I could think of nothing --

176
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,157
I was afraid.

177
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:04,757
If you're afraid, why do you work at all?

178
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:07,530
You can't get us a single sale.

179
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,620
And you've made us suffer a loss today.

180
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,730
Sorry, sir...

181
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,961
'Sorry'!

182
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,712
You'll say 'Sorry' and leave; I'll have to face the music!

183
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,396
Look, Meryem,

184
00:12:21,396 --> 00:12:24,363
I've done all that I could for you.

185
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:25,646
But now,

186
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:29,301
I can't risk my job anymore.

187
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:34,966
No, sir --
-Collect your dues from the Accounts department and leave.

188
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,770
What are you saying, sir -- ?

189
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,730
Please don't do this, sir --

190
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,351
You know my circumstances...

191
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,716
Without this job,

192
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:50,166
I can't pay for my father's medicines...

193
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,910
This isn't a charity

194
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,326
Where we help the helpless.

195
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:56,086
It was my favour on you

196
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:59,430
That I considered your circumstances and gave you a job.

197
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,976
But regrettably,

198
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:03,707
You are not capable of it.

199
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,206
And yes,

200
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:08,890
If I wanted,

201
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,746
I could, from your salary,

202
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:14,970
Deduct the amount of loss our company has suffered,

203
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,024
But I'm not.

204
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:21,380
It's better that you don't waste your time and mine,

205
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,453
It's better that you don't waste your time and mine, and leave.

206
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,636
Si --
-The door is that way.

207
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,306
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

208
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:46,310
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

209
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:52,266
<i>This cold, callous life</i>

210
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:57,700
<i>This dolorous, damned life</i>

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,346
Why are you worried? She must be on her way.

212
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:15,285
I've become a sack of diseases with each passing day,

213
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,374
What do I do?

214
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,770
Instead of lifting the burden off my daughter's shoulders,

215
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,926
I've become a burden on my daughter, Shaista Begum!

216
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,010
What are you saying! Don't get all worried!

217
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,988
She'd be here any moment.

218
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:32,900
Hello!

219
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,980
Where were you, my child?

220
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,956
Here she is.

221
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:39,303
Your dad was getting so stressed. He's already unwell.

222
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:42,090
I said, 'Have patience', and there you came.

223
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,630
I've brought the medicines, Dad.

224
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,576
Get some food for him, she must be tired; I'll take the medicines later.

225
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:53,530
Take your medicines; I'll give her food.

226
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,130
My dear,

227
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,981
What's wrong with you?

228
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,980
Something --

229
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,590
Is it something at your office? Is everything alright?

230
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,430
It's nothing.

231
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,230
Everything's fine.

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,210
I'll get you some water.

233
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,346
Something's

234
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,801
Off...

235
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,627
It's nothing, don't worry.

236
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,990
Meryem,

237
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,656
Should I serve the food now?

238
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,815
What happened, dear? Why are you worried?

239
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,511
Meryem?

240
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,960
What happened, Meryem?

241
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,172
Mum --

242
00:16:08,172 --> 00:16:11,265
Mum -- I've lost my job...

243
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,270
Why?

244
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,661
What happened? Tell me.

245
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,112
I was selling tea leaves...

246
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,776
Went to this house,

247
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:33,370
I came across a man --

248
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,920
He said, 'Come in and make a cup of tea',

249
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,900
He misbehaved with me --

250
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,851
I ran away.

251
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,379
I could not think of anything --

252
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,180
When I returned to the office,

253
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,710
I realised I'd left everything there -- I was told, 'You won't work here anymore --'

254
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,160
They fired me --

255
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:25,029
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

256
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:36,480
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

257
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,731
Shaista,

258
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,821
Is everything alright?

259
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,788
Yes, I --

260
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,276
Need some money.

261
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:47,800
I paid you your salary just two days ago.

262
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,736
Yes, but --

263
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,520
My husband is ailing, so...

264
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,640
I need some money for his medicines...

265
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,136
You can't even teach kids properly,

266
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,200
Look at Mohsin.

267
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,110
He's stuck on the fifth chapter for eight months.

268
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,010
And Ehsan? He's not even finished the first.

269
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,990
No --

270
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:11,460
I do my best, but your children lack the interest.

271
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,600
You're on leave four to five times a month, and then you blame the children?

272
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
No --

273
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,150
The kids don't pay attention...

274
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,806
I don't want to argue with you.

275
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,666
I pay you a hefty sum.

276
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,543
The neighbourhood teacher would charge half the amount.

277
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:26,073
And I don't like your asking for an advance every now and then.

278
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,780
You should quit this habit.

279
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,933
And if you can't,

280
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:34,028
Find somewhere else. I can't bear with this everyday. Please.

281
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,086
Pant-shirt?
[Western dress = minor taboo]

282
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:00,975
Yes.
[Western dress = minor taboo]

283
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,224
You'll have to wear pants and a shirt.
[Western dress = minor taboo]

284
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:05,033
It's a perfume shop.

285
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:08,640
It's a favourite of the toffs.

286
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,346
No...

287
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,426
I've never worn those.

288
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,056
You'll have to.

289
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:20,543
And either way, wearing pant-shirt is rather common among girls...

290
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,926
But Saira --

291
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,008
Just look at your necessity.

292
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:33,840
And I don't think you'll get such a handsome salary elsewhere.

293
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,910
What's all of this, Mum?

294
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,116
Why? What happened?

295
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:51,226
You want one of these to be your daughter-in-law.

296
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:54,166
Yes, what's wrong?

297
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,650
They're from honourable families... Well-educated...

298
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,046
With a great background.

299
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,160
I don't think so by their looks.

300
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,386
See for yourself.

301
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:06,456
Not the right thing to say!

302
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,708
This...

303
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,320
Do these look like matrimonial pictures?

304
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,270
They're more like entries for a fashion show.

305
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,606
Check out the pose.

306
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:19,936
You can have it in writing

307
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:23,377
These girls must spend half their day on social media.

308
00:20:23,377 --> 00:20:27,356
Not one would know what it means to run the household.

309
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:30,117
Y'alls are picking the best sister-in-law for me!

310
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,420
Oh really!

311
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,357
He doesn't like one of them.

312
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,410
Show me, Mum!
-What do you want to see -- Hey!

313
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,201
I'll tell you.

314
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,076
Look.

315
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:40,030
She's so adorable.

316
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,186
That's unfair. What do they lack?

317
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,230
I've been saying the same thing.

318
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,020
But all he does is find faults in them.

319
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,521
Anyway. Leave it be.

320
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:50,750
If you don't like any one of these,

321
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,090
Tell me the kind of girl you're interested in. What does she look like?

322
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,740
Mum... My lady should be one

323
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,550
With modesty in her eyes,

324
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,001
With long hair and earrings in her ears...

325
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:13,610
A beauty of the Orient in every way.

326
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,320
As for my disposition, well, you know it well enough already.

327
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,076
Now that you've said everything,

328
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:25,376
Tell me where I'd find your girl.

329
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,010
I'm sorry, that's your responsibility!

330
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,720
There, now!
-How say we make one taking the best of all of these?

331
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,297
Only he doesn't like any one of them!

332
00:21:34,297 --> 00:21:36,790
You won't find one for him like that.
-All of them so comely!

333
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,090
Ain't she so sweet?

334
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,121
Meryem...

335
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,700
We're out of medicines,

336
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,386
And so are the rations.

337
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:57,770
I asked the good lady for some money, but...

338
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,596
She refused.

339
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,818
Don't worry, Mum...

340
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,356
I've talked to a friend about a job.

341
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,076
Just pray

342
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:20,926
That I get the job.

343
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,690
Nature has its strange way...

344
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,190
Some are given so much

345
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,360
As they don't need,

346
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,690
And some

347
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,951
Not even as much as to fulfil their needs...

348
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,586
Mum...

349
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:52,356
Don't worry.

350
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,580
If the Lord wills,

351
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,390
He'd give us a lot.

352
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,710
To be honest,

353
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,910
After this incident,

354
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,560
I do not want you to work.

355
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,510
But circumstances compel me...

356
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,080
If you don't work,

357
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,250
How can we get medicines for your father

358
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,951
Run the household?

359
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,000
How many times have I told you not to call me when I'm home?

360
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,681
I'm so distressed, Alam...

361
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:54,451
How do I help you from over here?

362
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,470
I'm pregnant...

363
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:04,850
Days go by and I have no idea what to do...

364
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,640
Alam, my honour rests in your hands now...

365
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,814
You're there, Alam, aren't you?

366
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,591
Yes.

367
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:20,992
Alam, why don't you ask your mother to propose our marriage?

368
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,586
Don't worry.

369
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:25,920
I'll do something.

370
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,567
Do whatever you have to quickly... I'm in a pinch...

371
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,916
I told you I'd do something...

372
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,070
'Karachi'

373
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,266
Sir!

374
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,760
Sir, may I help you?

375
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,330
Which brand would you prefer?

376
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,320
You're new here?

377
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,900
Sir?

378
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,740
I mean, I'm a regular around here.

379
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,330
Everyone knows me.

380
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,621
They know which brand I use.

381
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,701
You're new here, right?

382
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,237
Yes, it's just been a few days.

383
00:26:02,777 --> 00:26:05,760
That is why I don't know about you...

384
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,436
I'll get someone else.

385
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:09,666
How are you, Mr Alam?

386
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:11,550
I'm fine.

387
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,496
Why did you bother to come, sir?

388
00:26:13,496 --> 00:26:14,946
You could've asked us.

389
00:26:14,946 --> 00:26:17,766
We would've delivered the perfume to you.

390
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:21,530
I was just passing by and thought I'd have a look.

391
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,980
Meryem, show him the latest Gucci perfume.

392
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,970
Right, sir.

393
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,306
I'll be here in a sec.

394
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,831
Sorry, sir... It's a call from the head office.

395
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,896
Happy birthday, Meryem!

396
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,315
You remember?

397
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:47,891
How can I forget my friend's birthday?

398
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,962
Thank you!

399
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,327
Keep it with you; I'm attending to a customer. Don't let it get spoilt!

400
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,501
Sir, here's the latest collection.

401
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:06,664
Which one's the most expensive perfume here for...

402
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:08,348
Women?

403
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,760
Come with me, sir, I'll show you.

404
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,700
Let's.

405
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,320
Come, sir.

406
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,156
Here, sir.

407
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:28,010
The most expensive one... This...

408
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,696
Issey Miyake.

409
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,206
And...

410
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,869
This one's real good.

411
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,766
Yuzu.

412
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,466
Yes, sir?

413
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,001
Which one do <i>you</i> like?</i>

414
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,461
Sir?

415
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,350
What can I say?

416
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,550
You decide...

417
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,980
I'm asking for your advice.

418
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,561
Which one would've you have bought for yourself?

419
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,006
This one.

420
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,729
Then give me this one.

421
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:28,060
I'll get it packed.
-No.

422
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,061
I'll get it packed myself.

423
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,580
Okay.

424
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,606
This one?

425
00:28:36,606 --> 00:28:37,923
Yes, sir.

426
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,946
Ma'am.

427
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:30,976
Ma'am, your tea.

428
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,026
Is Mr Alam here?

429
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:46,857
Not yet...

430
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,456
You may leave.

431
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Happy birthday, Meryem!

432
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,496
But...

433
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,176
Sir, this --

434
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,956
This is for you from Mr Jan'e Alam.

435
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,060
What?

436
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,386
Yes.

437
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,066
No, but --

438
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,547
Why for me?

439
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,270
He's a rich man.

440
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,406
A man with a lot of money

441
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:30,007
Finds such ways to shower his generosity.

442
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:34,534
The likes of us can only say 'Happy birthday to you',

443
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:35,955
Or give

444
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:38,205
These roses.

445
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,990
This is for you from all of us.

446
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,404
Thanks.

447
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,840
Malik!

448
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,150
Yessir?

449
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,300
This girl named Meryem at the perfume shop...

450
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,021
I want her complete biodata.

451
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,052
Okay, sir.

452
00:31:16,052 --> 00:31:17,903
It will be done.

453
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,020
Weeping and wailing like this will solve nothing!

454
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,566
Stop it!

455
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,870
You can't even begin to fathom how troubled I am!

456
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,430
Why can't I?

457
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,106
I know a problem's come up!

458
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,230
Okay, don't worry...

459
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,896
I've thought of something.

460
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,966
Alam --

461
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:46,876
Why don't you talk to your mother about our marriage?

462
00:32:48,557 --> 00:32:51,547
It isn't so easy, Noor us-Saba...

463
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:53,310
One, Mum won't agree to it.

464
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,060
I'll need some time to convince her; this --

465
00:32:57,513 --> 00:33:00,183
I think

466
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:02,063
It'll take a while.

467
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,890
How much more time do you need?

468
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:10,110
Why don't you understand that my situation is getting worse by the moment?

469
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,129
Alright -- come here.

470
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:19,233
Nothing's going to happen; I'm with you.

471
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,884
Look here.

472
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,279
I'm with you.

473
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,230
I won't let anything happen to you.

474
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,884
Won't you drop me home?

475
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,200
I would love to, but I have a very important meeting...

476
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,727
Don't worry. I'll ask Malik to drop you home.

477
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:03,320
I'll go myself.
-Hey!

478
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,676
How will you go alone?

479
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,710
That's my concern.

480
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,890
A weird kind of a man, really.

481
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,390
A complete stranger to me,

482
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,530
Yet he gifted me such a costly perfume.

483
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,210
It cost 15,000.

484
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,080
What?

485
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,440
Yes.

486
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,530
I think you should not have taken it from him.

487
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,450
I wouldn't have if he'd given me.

488
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,450
But he left it at the counter.

489
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,430
You're so simple, Meryem. You don't know men these days.

490
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,516
They're not as straightforward as they may seem.

491
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:01,696
Tell me - why would a complete stranger

492
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:04,806
Gift you such an expensive perfume?

493
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,246
Why?

494
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:09,111
Because he was trying to impress you.

495
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:15,470
He gifted you a perfume today; tomorrow, he'll take you out for coffee, and then he'll try to talk to you every now and then.

496
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,500
And you'll lose your job because of this.

497
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,207
God forbid!

498
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,050
You know, Saira,

499
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,240
How important this job is for me.

500
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,751
That's why I'm saying this.

501
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,320
Tell me, Saira. What should I do now?

502
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,660
Return the perfume to him, and remember -

503
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,720
The world is a market. It has good and bad people.

504
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,186
It is up to you how you identify them.

505
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,240
It's you, sir!

506
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,416
I was waiting for you.

507
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,292
Really?

508
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,062
No, I don't mean --

509
00:36:14,604 --> 00:36:16,992
Just a minute; I'm coming.

510
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,690
I'm sorry sir,

511
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,967
But I can't keep it.

512
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,956
Why? What happened?

513
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,480
Don't you like it?

514
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,260
Giving away such presents may be usual to you,

515
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,020
But the price of this perfume

516
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,210
Exceeds my salary.

517
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,770
I can't keep it. Thank you.

518
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,360
Wait.

519
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,210
Prices don't matter when gifting, Miss --

520
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,086
Meryem, right?

521
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:14,000
Gifts make sense when given by your own.

522
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,046
But to accept one

523
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:19,530
From a stranger doesn't suit me,

524
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,290
Which is why I can't keep it. Thank you.

525
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,231
Which is why I can't keep it. Thank you.
-Alright, listen.

526
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,990
I'll take it back, but let me be clear that it displeases me.

527
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,160
Would you do me a favour?

528
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,000
What kind of favour?

529
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
