1
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,116
Praise the Lord!

2
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:18,865
How sweet you look!

3
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:23,273
I'm seeing you so happy after so long...

4
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,882
Seeing you smile like this

5
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:29,450
Gives peace to my heart.

6
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,600
Just

7
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,001
Keep smiling like this, my dear.

8
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,860
I...

9
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,050
Want to forgive

10
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,760
Jan'e Alam

11
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,898
For every bit of injustice done to me.

12
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:53,689
Really?

13
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,910
I've thought a lot before taking this decision.

14
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,860
To do what he did

15
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,040
Was his sensibility,

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,620
And my sensibility says

17
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,860
That I put all the pain

18
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,060
And bitterness behind us.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,120
I knew it.

20
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,070
My daughter is very kind.

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,710
Sometimes,

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,440
To forgive

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,032
Is to dress

24
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,595
One's wounds.

25
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,590
Forgiveness

26
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,611
Eases one

27
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:49,280
And heals

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,236
The wounds of injustice.

29
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,350
Right.

30
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,976
So, may I sit here?

31
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:01,508
Sure, my dear. I'll meet the guests.

32
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,443
I'll leave you to yourselves.
-Thank you very much.

33
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,190
I'll be back.
-Okay.

34
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,300
I want to ask you something.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,666
Yes?

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,610
You wouldn't change now, would you?

37
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,799
You wouldn't betray me, would you?

38
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,770
I would rather sacrifice myself, Meryem,

39
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,875
Than betray you.

40
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,420
How great would it have been --

41
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,430
If --

42
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,070
Dad had been here today, too?

43
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,682
But...

44
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,990
Why don't you put everything behind us?

45
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,040
I

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,325
Forgive you.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,890
I accept you from the depths of my heart, Jan'e Alam.

48
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,960
By saying so, Meryem,

49
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,406
You've eased a burden on my heart.

50
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,643
Thank you very much.

51
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,381
I've got a surprise for you.

52
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:24,511
What kind of surprise?

53
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,631
Come.

54
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,108
Excuse me, everyone!

55
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:10,289
Come a bit closer, we've got a lot to talk about.

56
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,469
Thank you very much, all of you!

57
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,790
I am

58
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,330
Sincerely thankful to all of you

59
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,860
For honouring us

60
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,630
With your presence here.

61
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,140
I'm delighted today

62
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,920
To have been married to one whose family

63
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,610
Has such lovely people as these,

64
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,410
And I'm indeed fortunate

65
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,970
That I've been married

66
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,889
To someone like Meryem.

67
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,359
Wouldn't it all have been so wondrous had it been true!

68
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,970
That's right.

69
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,558
Innit?

70
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,850
I

71
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,610
Am the most unfortunate man in the world

72
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,610
To have been married

73
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,200
To one so depraved

74
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,370
As this chippy, Meryem!

75
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,710
I would've thrown her out the very next morning.

76
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,811
But no...

77
00:07:54,811 --> 00:08:01,720
I wanted to teach a lesson to every slapper out there

78
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,745
Who's ruined the family of an upright man like me.

79
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,460
Wh --

80
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,932
What are you sa --
-Shut up, you blimming con woman!

81
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,635
Don't you dare move forward!

82
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,391
You thought this chippy would be an albatross around my neck?

83
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:21,389
Didn't you feel any shame?

84
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,782
Didn't you feel any shame? Eh?

85
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,610
You were all at the wedding, weren't you?

86
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,140
I'd accepted her with utmost sincerity,

87
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,071
Saved her honour, but she --

88
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,620
On our very first night, I knew that she --

89
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,540
She's not the decent type.

90
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,962
I mean -- Just imagine -- An honourable man like me --

91
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:55,740
I've never even lied -- Imagine what would've befallen me!

92
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,597
What are you saying?

93
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:01,475
You know that Meryem --
-I know that <i>you</i>

94
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:03,910
Are her brother.

95
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,210
You're in on this with her, aren't you?

96
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,790
Ensnaring men like me to extort money?

97
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,820
Jan'e Alam!

98
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,359
Don't you dare raise your voice before me!

99
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,050
Your screams

100
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,948
Cannot hide the truth.

101
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:25,485
I would rather sacrifice myself, Meryem,

102
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:28,503
Than betray you.

103
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,729
Malik, you've been with me for so long...

104
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,550
Yet, even you couldn't see through me...

105
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,030
Jan'e Alam

106
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,890
Can forget everything,

107
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,940
But never his humiliation!

108
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,675
Your blood's boiling, innit?

109
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,470
Just wait and watch what I do to you, Malik.

110
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,240
My dear...

111
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,900
My dear...
-Hey!

112
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:28,231
You better know your place, you old hag!

113
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,580
I'm no one 'dear' to you!

114
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,174
All of you seem so upright and virtuous...

115
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:49,764
From respectable families... But <i>these two</i>!

116
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:53,780
They're besmirching the honour of your families.

117
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,616
Believe me, I've had a narrow escape!

118
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,946
So, I've decided

119
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:07,480
That you bear witness

120
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,060
As I teach this mare a lesson.

121
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,658
I'll end all your sorrows.

122
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,760
I'll give you the respect and honour

123
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,731
That you truly deserve.

124
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:23,440
Which is why...

125
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,960
I...

126
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,196
Divorce Meryem.

127
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,580
I divorce Meryem.

128
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,834
I...

129
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,856
Divorce her.

130
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,260
Felt all 400 of the volts?

131
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,168
This is Jan'e Alam's vengeance!

132
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,890
You will never forget it.

133
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,409
Halt!

134
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:44,550
For every single bit of injustice done to me,

135
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,640
My Lord God

136
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,610
Will make you pay!

137
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,535
Jan'e Alam!

138
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,450
Wait and watch

139
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,579
As God makes his move!

140
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,980
Wait and watch

141
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,365
How my Lord God chastens you!

142
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,658
Whoa!

143
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:25,752
Mum!
-Hey! Get up!

144
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:27,710
What happened to you?

145
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,680
Mum! What's happened to her?

146
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:43,000
Five Years Later

147
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,430
Murree

148
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,133
Miss Meryem,

149
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:02,830
Are you and the other teachers ready?

150
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,583
Mr Shan would be here any moment.
-Yes, ma'am, we're ready.

151
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:13,270
He wants that this school should be no less than any private school.

152
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,210
Don't worry.

153
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,891
You'll have no complaints.

154
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,646
It's him.

155
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,571
Thank you.

156
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:36,270
Thank you so much.

157
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,576
Thank you so much for this warm welcome.

158
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:46,576
And

159
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:48,480
It delights me

160
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,348
To see everyone like this.

161
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,729
I want to thank you, Madame Headmistress,

162
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,670
And all the teachers

163
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,206
Who have worked so hard with these children

164
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:01,220
And gotten us a better result than we'd ever expected.

165
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,790
Thank you!

166
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,045
Almir bin Sajjad, 1st position in class 4.

167
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,871
Humna Malik, 1st position in class 6.

168
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,966
But what about me, Mum?

169
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:55,181
Sarina Zahra, 1st position in class 7th.

170
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,720
For every single bit of injustice done to me,

171
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,554
My Lord God

172
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,797
Will make you pay!

173
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,149
M --

174
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,986
My sister --

175
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:28,162
My sister is innocent.

176
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:30,290
Wait and watch

177
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,859
How my Lord God chastens you!

178
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,564
Erum!

179
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,805
I'm coming, my dear!

180
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,240
My little doll!

181
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,020
I'm coming!

182
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,356
I...

183
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:49,031
I was looking for you.

184
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,943
So was I.

185
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,820
Looking for that sin

186
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,601
For which I've been punished.

187
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,650
Remember, Jan'e Alam,

188
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,657
If you swore a false oath,

189
00:18:05,657 --> 00:18:10,047
Your sister would have to suffer its consequences.

190
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,970
I --

191
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,590
I've booked an appointment for you with the best plastic surgeon in town. I --

192
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,672
I'll get this scar off you.

193
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,875
Why are you laughing like that?

194
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,856
You're home now.

195
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,207
You're home.

196
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,276
What do I do?

197
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,388
Become all innocent again?

198
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,901
No...

199
00:18:48,554 --> 00:18:52,045
Innocence is not a designer's dress

200
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:55,530
That you can buy me

201
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,197
And I can put on to dress my existence.

202
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,520
What could a surgeon do?

203
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,766
What's the best he could do?

204
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:08,896
Which scars could he hide?

205
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:16,581
Could he get the scars on my very existence, my soul, or my character off me?

206
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,850
I've talked to a psychiatrist.

207
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,064
She's called us tomorrow for therapy.

208
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,164
Just do me one favour.

209
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:32,399
Dig my grave in a corner of this room.

210
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:38,308
I can't step outside. I just can't!

211
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,013
You've always fulfilled every wish of mine, haven't you?

212
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:47,617
Please fulfil this last wish.

213
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,773
Shoot me dead!

214
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,632
No, Erum...

215
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,230
Set me free from this life.

216
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,290
Please, set me free...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

217
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,990
I'm in great pain. Please save me...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

218
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,629
No...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

219
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,540
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

220
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,306
Please end my suffering...
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

221
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:22,080
<i>Behold, now, as God makes His move</i>

222
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,630
<i>My Master...</i>

223
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,889
Please, take a seat.

224
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:36,174
No, I'd rather you sit. It's your seat and your office.

225
00:20:36,174 --> 00:20:39,107
Please, sit.
-Thank you.

226
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,216
You've gotten me a better result

227
00:20:43,216 --> 00:20:45,924
Than I ever expected.

228
00:20:45,924 --> 00:20:48,525
It's all thanks to you, sir.

229
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:51,574
Who wants those at the bottom to climb up these days,

230
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:55,009
Or that the son of a labourer become a doctor, engineer, or pilot?

231
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,637
I believe that everyone has a right to progress.

232
00:20:57,637 --> 00:21:00,212
It is not the patrimony of the few.

233
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:03,000
Everyone - rich or poor -

234
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,311
Should get an equal opportunity for betterment in life.

235
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,140
Anyway,

236
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,510
Let me know if you need any additional funds.

237
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,046
I'll get them transferred.

238
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:15,793
Sure, sir.

239
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,785
I want every child at our school

240
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:21,186
To get the same kind of education

241
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:24,461
As any private school in the big cities.

242
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:32,261
And believe me, the education system here is no less than that of any private school in the city.

243
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:33,840
I'm glad.

244
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,869
Thank you so much.

245
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,878
My dear...

246
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:18,265
My dear son...

247
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,897
It's been six months since Erum came home.

248
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:26,986
Why are you still in this condition?

249
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:34,050
Why do sisters get punished

250
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,874
For their brothers' sins, Mum?

251
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,536
That's how it is...

252
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,480
Women

253
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,463
Have to pay

254
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:50,294
For the sins of their men -

255
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:54,946
Fathers, brothers, husbands and sons.

256
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,550
If only I'd not sinned...

257
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,200
If only...

258
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,060
I hadn't sought revenge for my humiliation...

259
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,260
If only I hadn't ruined Meryem...

260
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,761
My sweet little doll...

261
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,465
Would've been fine.

262
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,232
She wouldn't have had to go through this pain, Mum.

263
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,578
Oh God...

264
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,998
Where could Meryem be?

265
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,415
I want to meet her once, ask forgiveness for my sins once.

266
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:57,328
If I see her,

267
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:59,074
I'd fall at her feet

268
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:00,585
And beg -- Ask her --

269
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:04,550
To take her curse back -- Her curse has struck me, Mum...

270
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,303
I'm in a great torment...

271
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:10,328
The Lord has heard her prayer.

272
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,880
There is no peace left and I grow restless!

273
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,045
Do me a favour, Mum...

274
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:23,066
Curse me that I die!

275
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,991
God forbid!

276
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,667
Don't say such things, my dear...

277
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,487
Don't say such things...

278
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,596
My daughter is as good as dead,

279
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:40,881
Please don't torment me by saying such things.

280
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:43,409
Don't say these things.

281
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:46,684
You're still worrying about me so much...

282
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,870
I've wronged you, too, Mum.

283
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,540
No...

284
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,380
I've wronged you, Mum, haven't I?

285
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,650
Mum, just do me a favour...

286
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,706
Before anyone else does it,

287
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,722
Kill me!

288
00:25:08,722 --> 00:25:10,330
Why are you doing this? No!
-Kill me!

289
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,591
What are you doing?
-Please, Mum -- I'm in great pain...

290
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,953
What are you doing?
-Please kill me, Mum! Kill me!

291
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,120
Calm down, my dear...
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

292
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,429
Kill me, Mum...
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

293
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,340
Calm down...
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

294
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,280
Meryem!
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

295
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,810
Where are you, Meryem?
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

296
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,680
Calm down, my dear...
<i>Every bit of me afflicted with this eldritch malaise,</i>

297
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,380
God...
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

298
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,600
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

299
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,660
Calm down...
<i>My life is now ruined</i>

300
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,450
<i>O Lord</i>

301
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,124
Mum --
<i>O Lord</i>

302
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:41,514
<i>O Lord</i>

303
00:25:41,514 --> 00:25:42,030
<i>Decide my fate</i>

304
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,781
Jan'e Alam?
<i>Decide my fate</i>

305
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:47,690
<i>Decide my fate</i>

306
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,140
Jan'e Alam?

307
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,060
Jan'e Alam?
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

308
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,210
Wake up!
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

309
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,430
What happened to you?
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

310
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,200
You don't get it, Ma'am. The Chairman's having a meeting inside.

311
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,420
So?

312
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,044
You can't go inside.

313
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,423
You don't know

314
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:04,154
What Mr Shan's like.

315
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:06,976
He'd leave every other thing to hear the poor out.

316
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,736
The Headmistress has asked me not to allow anyone in during meetings.

317
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,290
Look, sir, it's very important that I meet Mr Shan.

318
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,693
I've got to talk to him.

319
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:17,057
Let's see who can stop me!

320
00:26:17,057 --> 00:26:18,180
Step aside.
-Hey!

321
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,070
Wait, Ma'am!
-Let go!

322
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,141
Hey!

323
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,760
How'd you get in -- Why did you let her in?

324
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,654
I tried to stop her, Ma'am, but she barged in.

325
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,750
She said she's got to talk to the Chairman about something.

326
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,258
Just a minute.

327
00:26:33,478 --> 00:26:34,840
So you want to talk to me?

328
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,460
Yes, Mr Shan. I want to talk to you.

329
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,344
Pray tell?

330
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:41,990
Mr Shan, I want to tell you something

331
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,164
About what's going on in your school.

332
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:46,425
They're just looking after their own!

333
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:47,975
You'd said, hadn't you,

334
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:50,260
That there's no difference between the rich and the poor?

335
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,104
But why differentiate between the kids?

336
00:26:52,104 --> 00:26:53,146
What do you mean?

337
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,196
I don't get it.

338
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,930
Sir -- It's -- The teacher, you know --

339
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,543
She gave her niece the first place,

340
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:02,858
And my daughter the second place.

341
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:04,564
What's she saying, Madame Headmistress?

342
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:05,919
Who's she talking about?

343
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,064
Sir --

344
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,645
I have no idea.

345
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:12,765
I don't know what she's talking about -- I don't get it.

346
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,860
No need to cover it up, Ma'am.

347
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,221
You know everything.

348
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:18,720
I know the teacher, Mr Shan!

349
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,484
Her name's Meryem!

350
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:24,590
Her niece and my daughter are in the same class.

351
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,195
They're class-fellows.

352
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:29,395
They've scored the same marks.

353
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:31,523
But she awarded

354
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,617
The first place to her niece...

355
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:36,695
And the second place to my daughter.

356
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,895
These folks think

357
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,490
That we're poor...

358
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,806
What would we know about

359
00:27:41,806 --> 00:27:43,278
The first place

360
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,902
And second place?

361
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,831
But sir,

362
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:52,020
I expect fairness from you. My daughter's been crying so much...

363
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,500
She's always stood first!

364
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,433
Please don't cry.

365
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:57,981
Please.

366
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,549
I say, take her to the waiting area.

367
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,329
Please wait. I'll call you.

368
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:05,129
Thank you, Mr Shan,

369
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:07,293
Thank you so much.

370
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,737
Mr Alam,

371
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:17,030
You're alright.

372
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,230
Just continue taking your medicines.

373
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,894
You'd get worse if you stopped taking them.

374
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:26,760
Thank you, Doctor.

375
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,049
Take care.

376
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,859
Alright. Nasrin, leave the doctor outside.

377
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,290
Why didn't you take your medicines?

378
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,780
You do know that your depression will get worse if you don't take your medicines, don't you?

379
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,870
No medicine in this world can possibly help

380
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,886
Someone who's been cursed by the sobs of the helpless.

381
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,200
But yes, a lethal injection

382
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,850
Could surely ease the woes of life...

383
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,584
Does ease the woes of life...
-Shut up.

384
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:18,896
Don't say that again.

385
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,036
You're a wise man.

386
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,508
Just look at what you're saying.

387
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:30,163
What would happen to me?

388
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,598
Do you know that despair is sinful, too?

389
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:36,085
It displeases the Lord.

390
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,227
Doesn't everything that Jan'e Alam does?

391
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:43,728
What is going on?

392
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:48,085
Despite your --
-I have no idea what she was talking about.

393
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,500
I don't know anything.
-How come you don't know?

394
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,916
S --
I say...

395
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,455
What's her name?

396
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:55,436
Meryem.

397
00:29:55,436 --> 00:29:56,709
Please call her here.

398
00:29:56,709 --> 00:30:00,010
But sir --
-I'm saying call her here.

399
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,116
Right now. I want to talk to her. Please.

400
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:04,693
Okay.

401
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,550
Hello?

402
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,857
No.

403
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:15,864
Send Miss Meryem to my office.

404
00:30:15,864 --> 00:30:17,598
Quickly.

405
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,035
Look, Madame Headmistress,

406
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:29,772
I can't tolerate any kind of injustice in my school.

407
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,920
Alright, listen to this.

408
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,980
Listen carefully.

409
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,646
Don't jump to a 'no', okay?

410
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,980
My dear,

411
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,063
I say you

412
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:51,377
Think seriously about your marriage.

413
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm confident

414
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,318
That you'll be better quickly.

415
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,988
I've married once already...

416
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,462
Just forget all of that...

417
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:15,600
How can someone forget the destruction of another,

418
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,520
Especially when one's responsible for it?

419
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,426
Jan'e Alam...

420
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:26,344
If you keep on thinking like this -

421
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,340
Heavens forbid - Your condition will only get worse.

422
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,516
Please, don't...

423
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,240
I feel the same way.

424
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,894
I won't get better.

425
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,800
No.

426
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,350
Don't ever say that.

427
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,598
Okay?

428
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:50,354
Never.

429
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,563
Look, Aunt, I've scored 100 marks!
-Really?

430
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:05,152
I made the report cards but didn't notice!

431
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:06,723
What?

432
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,566
Why didn't you tell me?

433
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,830
Do you know how tensed I was, Aunt?

434
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,230
Could I have seen this broad smile if I'd told you before?

435
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,230
Congratulations, Humna!

436
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,360
Thank you, Aunt!

437
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,480
Alright, come and sit here. Tell me what you want as a gift.

438
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,570
Gift?

439
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,610
How much money have you got again?

440
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,340
Let's say...

441
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,830
Let's say... Five bags?

442
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,587
5,000?

443
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:32,730
I'll have to think, then!

444
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,569
Oh?

445
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:37,250
Then, think hard about what you'd want!
-Miss...

446
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,430
The Headmistress has called you to her office.

447
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,939
I'm coming.

448
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,990
I'll be back, okay?

449
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:06,490
How long will this go on?

450
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,866
How long will you continue to torment yourself?

451
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,121
Have you seen the scar on Erum's forehead, Mum?

452
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,500
I feel that my past

453
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,306
Is etched in those scars.

454
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:39,326
Whenever I look at her forehead,

455
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:43,873
I feel like my past is standing before me,

456
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:47,335
Screaming,

457
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:53,380
For every single bit of injustice done to me,

458
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,500
My Lord God

459
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,776
Will make you pay!

460
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,650
'Jan'e Alam',

461
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,412
'Watch how the Lord chastens you!'

462
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,743
God...

463
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,200
<i>I</i> should've been punished for my sins.

464
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,966
Set me free from this life.

465
00:34:26,966 --> 00:34:31,230
I'm in great pain.

466
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:38,130
Meryem's curse should've destroyed Jan'e Alam and spared my sister...

467
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,230
My sister's suffered a lot...

468
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,862
Erum's so innocent, isn't she?

469
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,371
She still thinks I'm an angel...

470
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,140
If only she found out

471
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,033
That she's been punished for <i>my</i> sins...

472
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,636
How much she'd grow to despise me...

473
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:17,743
Look, Miss,

474
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:19,413
This is a disciplined school,

475
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:22,208
And I will not tolerate

476
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,370
Any kind of injustice to any student.

477
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,960
If your niece studies here, don't ever think that you can favour her.

478
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,680
It's nothing like that, sir!

479
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,975
I've worked on the results with utmost fairness.
-Fairness, you say?

480
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:38,340
When your niece and my daughter scored the same marks,

481
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,490
Why did you award the first place to your niece?

482
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,880
Your daughter's stood second because --
-Oh? Can't kids fall sick?

483
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,850
She pushed my daughter back just because she had a fever for one day?

484
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,717
What kind of fairness is that?

485
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,531
It's noth --
-Please...

486
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,710
I don't want any dispute here.

487
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,025
Please,

488
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,617
Revise the results.

489
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:06,440
I'll announce the new results in the class tomorrow in person.

490
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,581
But, sir --
-I don't like having to repeat myself.

491
00:36:10,581 --> 00:36:15,965
You will revise the results and award both the girls the first place.

492
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,954
It's your responsibility now.

493
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:19,220
Are we clear?

494
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,078
Okay, sir.
-Yes, sir.

495
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,095
Bleedin' nepotist!

496
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
