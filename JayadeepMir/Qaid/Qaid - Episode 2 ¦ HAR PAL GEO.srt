1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,426
Long time no see!

2
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:05,800
You haven't brought Tasnim along?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,630
She'd... Gone over to Aunt's; she's not well.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,220
She'd... Gone over to Aunt's; she's not well.
-Oh...

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,590
May the Lord give her good health.

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,190
Appa Bi...

7
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,036
Where are Ashir and Adan?

8
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:16,286
They're in the room upstairs.

9
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,896
I'll go and meet them.

10
00:00:19,206 --> 00:00:20,257
Come.
-Alright.

11
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:21,600
I'll rouse Sofia.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,420
Please, sit.

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,741
After you, Appa.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,476
Please, sit. I'll call her.
-Sure.

15
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,631
Alright, alright...

16
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,632
We'll see.

17
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:54,622
C'mon!

18
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:57,452
Hello!

19
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:01,320
It's a good habit to knock before entering.

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,210
Sorry,

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,030
But I'm a bit short on good habits.

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you, Farah?

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,311
I'm fine.

24
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,230
How are you?

25
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:13,973
He's very well. Why don't you wait downstairs with everyone? We're coming.

26
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:14,742
Adan!

27
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,053
Oh --

28
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:18,110
I don't really mind what he says...

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,926
I know he's joking.

30
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:23,480
I was quite serious.

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,991
Uncle's come, too?

32
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,022
Yes.

33
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:29,650
He's downstairs.

34
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,287
Alright, let's meet him.

35
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:32,000
No!

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,130
Wait! Let's finish this game!

37
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,326
Wait! Let's finish this game!
-Later.

38
00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:35,986
C'mon.

39
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:40,027
I'm asking you for the last time. Just help me this one last time...

40
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:42,900
Believe me, there's a lot of scope in this business.

41
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,206
Taufiq,

42
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:46,080
How many business ideas

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,660
Have you squandered millions on!

44
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,576
Oh, please...

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,086
You're saying all the wrong things to me...

46
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,166
I mean,

47
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,040
You don't have money to give to your brother,

48
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,122
And whom are you helping?

49
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,982
And whom are you helping? Your stepson!

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,520
You have tons of money to help set up <i>his</i> business in Australia!

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,146
Taufiq!

52
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,850
I'd better not hear that again!

53
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,737
As if I've said anything wrong.

54
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,810
I'm explaining a few things to you. Show some sense.

55
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,736
That Ashir is a snake, I tell you!

56
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,107
He'd have everything under his name and you and Adan

57
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:28,470
He'd have everything under his name and you and Adan thrown out one day!

58
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,060
If you're here for this load of cod, it's better that you don't come here, Uncle.

59
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,211
Ashir!

60
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,130
Mum, ask him to get out this moment.

61
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,661
Why?

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,793
Have I said anything wrong?

63
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:53,554
A stepson's a stepson.
-Enough, Taufiq.

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,900
Haven't you done enough damage already?

65
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,896
It's better that you show yourselves out.

66
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,020
And it's better that you don't show up again.

67
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,701
And <i>you</i> go back to your room!

68
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,513
Right now!

69
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,740
Your young'un's got a hot head.

70
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,110
Keep him in check

71
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,590
Or you'd be crying one day.

72
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,070
Remember that.

73
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,610
Come.

74
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,120
But --
-Enough, Barkat.

75
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,326
I thought you'd honour me now that I've come.

76
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,610
But I expected too much of you...

77
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,910
I hold you in the highest regard...

78
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,016
All I'm asking for is some time to think...

79
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,968
That's just a subtler way to refuse, innit, Barkat?

80
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:01,616
No, we're not refusing...

81
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,436
Munir's our own kid.

82
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,748
Oh, leave that be.

83
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,967
If he were your own, you'd not have asked for time.

84
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,134
You had so much confidence in your brother, didn't you?

85
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,134
Is so much respect enough?

86
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:16,474
Let's go.

87
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:17,365
Please,

88
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,260
Don't leave like that.

89
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,144
All I'm asking for is a couple of days to think over it.

90
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,600
Just try to understand my side of things.

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,640
Alright, Barkat.

92
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,906
Two days.

93
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:34,056
But remember,

94
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,550
After this decision,

95
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,616
Either we'd be in agreement until Judgement Day,

96
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:43,767
Or we won't even bear the pall for each other.

97
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,411
Come.

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,450
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

99
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,600
That Ashir is a snake, I tell you!
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,810
That Ashir is a snake, I tell you!
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

101
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,430
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

102
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,716
Wait.
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

103
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,478
Just wait and watch. You think of him as your own, don't you?
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

104
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,348
He'll prove he's your stepson.
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

105
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,082
He'll prove he's your stepson.
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

106
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:46,710
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

107
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,530
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

108
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,386
He'd have everything under his name and you and Adan thrown out one day!
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

109
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,560
He'd have everything under his name and you and Adan thrown out one day!
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,036
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

111
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:02,206
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

112
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,026
What happened? Isn't he answering the phone?

113
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,537
No.

114
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,947
I'm very worried.

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,980
Adan's locked himself inside his room, too.

116
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,280
It was very bad of Taufiq.

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,106
Both of them are very hurt.

118
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,620
I wish I could change Taufiq's mindset.

119
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,316
As if one can change the mindset of people like him!

120
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:39,066
For everything they lacked in their lives,

121
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,207
They'd get even by ruining others' happiness.

122
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,740
Appa,

123
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,056
You've seen that I've never discriminated between Ashir and Adan.

124
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:54,146
I won't let anyone else discriminate between them either.

125
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,730
I've not given birth to Ashir,

126
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,140
But I've always thought of him as a part of me.

127
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,466
I know!

128
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,970
I know.

129
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,100
I've seen it.

130
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,410
Neither of the kids doubts your love.

131
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,010
Don't get all worried.

132
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,060
If the Lord wills, their love will never change.

133
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,941
If the Lord wills thus...

134
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,510
Two days.

135
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,500
But remember,

136
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,240
After this decision,

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,966
After this decision,
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

138
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:00,070
Either we'd be in agreement until Judgement Day,
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

139
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,006
Or we won't even bear the pall for each other.
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

140
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:04,886
Or we won't even bear the pall for each other.
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

141
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:08,920
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

142
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,836
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

143
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:21,186
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

144
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:24,850
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

145
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,950
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

146
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,472
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

147
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:36,873
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

148
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,220
Don't start it all over again.

149
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,940
Farah had been at it all the way.

150
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,526
Lecturing me,

151
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,120
'It was very unfair', 'You shouldn't have said that',

152
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,310
'Ashir would feel bad about it', 'It'd have hurt him'...

153
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,946
May I say something?

154
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:58,040
We've spent our lives somehow.

155
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,580
We should just think of what's best for Farah.

156
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,440
What do you mean?

157
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,580
I mean

158
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,590
I think Farah has started liking Ashir.

159
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,426
Are you out of your mind?

160
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:09,430
That stepson?

161
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,056
Yes, he's a stepson.

162
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,627
But never forget

163
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:15,290
This flourishing business was his father's.

164
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,796
Bah.

165
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,087
'It was his father's'...

166
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:21,207
All of this -- The warehouse, the factory...

167
00:09:21,207 --> 00:09:22,539
This business...

168
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,610
Sofia's built it up with her own effort.

169
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,186
Alright, alright...

170
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:29,916
Then, why quarrel over it

171
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,060
When something could be resolved with love and affection?

172
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,920
I think

173
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,969
That we can't find a better man for Farah than Ashir.

174
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,256
Get me some tea.

175
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,756
Okay.

176
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,548
Ashir...

177
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,316
Ashir!

178
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,821
You're up, Mum?

179
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,556
How could I sleep

180
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,897
With you gone like that

181
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:44,606
And not answering your phone?

182
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:48,850
I'm sorry... I thought it best to leave then.

183
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,516
No, my dear...

184
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:56,990
Believe me, Mum, I didn't think in the least that you and Adan think of me as an outsider.

185
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,850
No one is and will be dearer to me than the two of you.

186
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,096
But --

187
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,557
I don't get --

188
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:06,326
Why Uncle Taufiq --
-Didn't you just say

189
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,860
That Adan and I are the only ones who matter to you?

190
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,780
Then, why are you troubling yourself over someone's nonsense?

191
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,360
Believe me,

192
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,879
There is no one closer to Adan and me than you.

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,727
I'm starving.

194
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,116
Haven't you had dinner?

195
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,857
You wouldn't have, either.

196
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,966
And Adan?

197
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,596
Don't even ask.

198
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:35,640
I had to force him to have something.

199
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,741
He was furious.

200
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,137
C'mon.

201
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,958
Let's have dinner.

202
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,739
Are you insane?

203
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:47,168
You're kidding, right?

204
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,428
Do you actually think I'm kidding?

205
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,898
I'm actually worried, Suboor.

206
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:53,988
I don't want to marry

207
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,978
I don't want to marry that blimming Munir.

208
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:57,369
Don't, then.

209
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,179
As if anyone's forcing you.

210
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:00,230
Just refuse.

211
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,586
It's not that simple for me, Suboor.

212
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,060
The class I belong to

213
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,320
Has families fight over a daughter getting educated.

214
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,490
And this is about marriage!

215
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,797
Hold on...

216
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:20,657
Have you talked about Ashir?

217
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,976
When will you?

218
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:29,276
When Munir's here with the wedding procession?

219
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,096
Blimey, mate...

220
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:39,607
Brooding and worrying over it won't help.

221
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:44,356
I'm sure Uncle and Aunt would never refuse if Ashir's parents came here with a proposal.

222
00:12:44,356 --> 00:12:47,826
And this Munir affair will end for good.

223
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:52,116
Suboor...

224
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:55,747
Would you talk to Mum about Ashir?

225
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,427
Thank you!

226
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,726
Is there anything

227
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,837
Left for you to say after yesterday

228
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:34,258
That you've come again?

229
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,940
I've come to apologise.

230
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,436
I'm very ashamed of myself...

231
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,986
I said a bit too much yesterday.

232
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,380
But I --

233
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,916
I'm under so much stress that I can't even tell you...

234
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,007
Besides, who do I have except you?

235
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:57,990
Whom would I share my problems with?

236
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,820
But I've ended up hurting you,

237
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,526
Grieving you...

238
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,316
Not <i>just</i> me.

239
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,408
Your words have greatly hurt Ashir and Adan, too.

240
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:14,488
I'll apologise to them, too.

241
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,130
They're like my sons; surely, they'd forgive me.

242
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,303
It's not as if it'd belittle me to apologise.

243
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,990
That will not be necessary.

244
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,736
But remember,

245
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,926
You will never say anything like it again.

246
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:32,940
Didn't I tell you, I'm so tensed --

247
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,310
Believe me, I've --

248
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,220
Sometimes, I have no idea what I'm saying.

249
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,550
There's so many problems at home --

250
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,596
Well,

251
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:44,837
I do what I can to --

252
00:14:44,837 --> 00:14:47,197
Make ends meet,

253
00:14:47,197 --> 00:14:51,106
But my heart sinks when I think about Farah.

254
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:55,366
But naturally, I have to get her married.

255
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:58,436
My mind stops working to think of it.

256
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:01,010
You don't need to worry.

257
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,826
Farah's my daughter, too.

258
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,176
I'll leave no stone unturned in doing my part for her when the time comes.

259
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,547
Thank you very much.

260
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,866
You've got this great weight off my chest.

261
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,436
I'm --

262
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,656
Very ashamed of myself...

263
00:15:26,656 --> 00:15:29,809
Once again, I'm sorry...

264
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,239
C'mon, now, would you still be cross?

265
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:38,397
Won't you fix your mood and ask me if I want tea or coffee?

266
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,258
It'd be unfair, Aunt.

267
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:49,620
Does your heart consent to Reham and Munir's marriage?

268
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,720
What does it matter if her heart or mine consents to it?

269
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,850
The section of society we belong to

270
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,546
Decides not with their hearts but their minds,

271
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:05,126
And compromises are valued over happiness.

272
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:08,847
If her heart's committed the sin of hoping for something,

273
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,967
It'd be better that she atone for it.

274
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,624
That <i>is</i> what she'd do.

275
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:21,606
Bow her head quietly before your honour and your order,

276
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,476
But never be happy.

277
00:16:23,476 --> 00:16:27,726
She'd quietly die from within every single day.

278
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,536
You have to decide, Aunt -

279
00:16:38,536 --> 00:16:42,476
Do you want a life of happiness and satisfaction for Reham,

280
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:47,620
Or one where she regrets her very existence?

281
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,221
We can't take up arms against the family.

282
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:51,190
I know.

283
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,941
But Uncle's always done so for the sake of Reham's happiness.

284
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,051
Just talk to him once.

285
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:01,440
I know he won't be able to refuse after meeting Ashir's family.

286
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,267
Besides, he'd invited Ashir himself.

287
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,567
Please, Aunt...

288
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,618
Alright.

289
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,971
Ask Ashir to come here with his Mum.

290
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,440
Hello?

291
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,650
Are you ready to prove your love, Mr Ashir?

292
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,566
What happened?

293
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,081
Nothing <i>yet</i>,

294
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:45,126
But if you didn't go to Reham's with Aunt,

295
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,760
She'd be married off to her cousin, Munir.

296
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,491
W --

297
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,520
W -- What?

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,180
Aye.

299
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,181
So you'd better make haste with your proposal

300
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:53,981
Before he does.

301
00:17:53,981 --> 00:17:55,854
So, hurry up.

302
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,280
They asked for time, and you gave them just that, Dad.

303
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,880
They'd staved us off on the pretext of her studies before. What is it this time?

304
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,201
It's just a matter of two days; can't you wait?

305
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:14,340
I don't trust Barkat's intentions.

306
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,490
Don't get too excited. He might even refuse.

307
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,160
Mum --

308
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,426
Please say something good.

309
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:20,836
Just let him refuse.

310
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,020
Just see what I'll do.

311
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,187
He won't refuse.

312
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,627
Do you understand what this refusal means?

313
00:18:26,627 --> 00:18:29,392
He'd have to sever ties with everyone in the family.

314
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:30,622
Think again, Dad.

315
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:32,100
Hurry with whatever you're thinking of.

316
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,771
I can't wait much longer.

317
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,488
He's out of his mind.

318
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,256
Talk to Barkat quickly.

319
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:45,206
I'm afraid he may do something.

320
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,607
Oh?

321
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,508
That's splendid.

322
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,507
Quickly now, talk to Sofia.

323
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,008
How can I talk to Mum, Appa Bi?

324
00:18:56,008 --> 00:19:01,790
She'd strongly emphasised that I focus only on the business, and that was my intention, too.

325
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,706
I didn't know such a situation would come up.

326
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,557
You know fully well how much she loves you,

327
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,250
How she dotes on you.

328
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,017
She'd be delighted and not angry.

329
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:12,118
Just talk to her for once.

330
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:14,918
What if she got angry?

331
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,167
Leave it to me.

332
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,216
Besides, even if she got angry with you,

333
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:21,550
It'd only be for a moment.

334
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,237
But if your love got angry with you,

335
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:28,007
What would you do about your own heartache?

336
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,696
For the first time in my life, I've apologised to someone on your insistence.

337
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:37,356
If this didn't bear fruit...

338
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:39,667
What are you talking about!

339
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:42,306
Why wouldn't it bear fruit?

340
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,550
Love is a powerful force.

341
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,127
And wily love

342
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:47,872
And wily love is exceptionally powerful.

343
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:50,093
Good Lord...!

344
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:55,502
Got to admit, you've done a rather exceptional duty as a wife!

345
00:19:56,053 --> 00:20:01,490
Not once did it occur to me

346
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,110
That there could be no better suitor for our Farah than Ashir.

347
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,616
Just wait and watch.

348
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:09,401
Our Farah would rule over there.

349
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:11,606
And do you know the best part?

350
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:14,536
Sofia thought the same way, too.

351
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:16,480
She said to me immediately,

352
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,236
'Don't worry about Farah'.

353
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:20,977
'Farah's <i>my</i> daughter'.

354
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,917
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

355
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,626
<i>Come here</i>

356
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,386
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

357
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,077
<i>Come here</i>

358
00:20:30,077 --> 00:20:31,778
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

359
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,068
<i>Come here</i>

360
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:36,930
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

361
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,640
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

362
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,340
<i>Come here</i>

363
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,000
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

364
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,801
<i>Come here</i>

365
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:45,472
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

366
00:20:45,472 --> 00:20:46,741
<i>Come here</i>

367
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,393
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

368
00:20:49,393 --> 00:20:53,165
<i>This ambience is blossoming once again,</i>

369
00:20:53,165 --> 00:20:56,225
<i>The ambience of this redolent world</i>

370
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:59,616
<i>And the Heavens are humming a melody once again</i>

371
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:03,917
<i>Come here already, my beloved...</i>

372
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,276
Come in.

373
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:27,916
Hey!

374
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,566
You haven't gone to bed yet, Ashir!

375
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:33,016
Mum -- I --

376
00:21:33,016 --> 00:21:35,450
I wanted to talk to you about something.

377
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,726
Come and sit.

378
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,480
What is it? Why are you thinking so much?

379
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm not sure how I should ask you...

380
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,540
It's --

381
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,401
Just that you've given me everything in life without my having to ask for it.

382
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:08,770
You've fulfilled every wish and given me every happiness before I could say a word.

383
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,050
Now --

384
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,180
Now when I'm asking for something for the first time, I don't know --

385
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,686
How to ask for it.

386
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:18,256
In that case, I should be the one who's worried.

387
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:22,940
What is it that gives my son happiness that I've got no idea about?

388
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,980
No -- Mum -- It's not like that --

389
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,537
The thing is --

390
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:30,937
It wasn't planned at all --

391
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:33,880
I wanted to focus completely on the business --

392
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,550
Bu -- Now -- Th --

393
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:40,201
You like her very much, don't you?

394
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,916
Mum?

395
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,450
How --

396
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,251
Appa Bi?

397
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:49,632
It's etched on your face.

398
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,702
And once again,

399
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:55,292
You didn't have to ask for it.

400
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,896
You'll have no complaints from me, Mum.

401
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:04,256
I'd focus all my attention on the business.

402
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,776
Please, just for once,

403
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:08,517
Come with me...
-When are we going?

404
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,186
Tomorrow evening.

405
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,357
Done.

406
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,737
Thank you, Mum!

407
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:14,127
I love you so much!

408
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,897
Thank you!

409
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,990
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

410
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

411
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,969
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

412
00:23:39,969 --> 00:23:45,582
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

413
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:52,390
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

414
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,937
Ashir here.
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

415
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:59,226
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

416
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:06,066
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

417
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:13,227
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

418
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:16,210
Hello?

419
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:23,087
I didn't know you were more eager to become mine than I was to make you mine!

420
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,870
Anyway, don't worry.

421
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,070
Let me tell you your wait's over.

422
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,838
Mum and I will be there tomorrow.

423
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,440
Tell Uncle that I'll not be coming just for tea.

424
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,124
I'd be coming to take his most precious treasure.

425
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,640
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

426
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,300
<i>Come here</i>

427
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,061
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

428
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,822
<i>Come here</i>

429
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:43,491
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

430
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:44,771
<i>Come here</i>

431
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:48,951
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

432
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:51,603
Splendid.

433
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:53,354
You'd invited him yourself,

434
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:54,903
And now you're asking, 'Who is it'?

435
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:58,093
Who are you talking about?

436
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,160
Oh --

437
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,500
The lad who'd come to drop Reham the other day? He had such a nice name... Whatzit...
-Ashir.

438
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,346
Ah, right, Ashir. I'd forgotten.

439
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:10,650
Yes... I'd invited himself myself.

440
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,056
He'd called, too.

441
00:26:12,056 --> 00:26:14,020
Reham had turned him down,

442
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,806
I told her to ask Dad first.

443
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:19,970
No, turning him down would be improper.

444
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:25,290
Besides, a guest is a blessing from the Lord. And anyhow, I'd invited him myself.

445
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,778
When's he coming?

446
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:27,907
6 o'clock.

447
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:29,690
6 o'clock...

448
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,719
Alright.

449
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:33,249
Regale them when they're here.

450
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:35,886
Let me know if I have to get anything to eat.

451
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,888
No, we have everything at home.

452
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,076
Alright, then.

453
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:40,920
I'll get going.

454
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,076
Bye.

455
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,841
Thank you, Mum.

456
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,390
May you live long, my dear.

457
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,040
You're happy now, aren't you?

458
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,606
You've acted like an outsider, now, haven't you?

459
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,866
How many times had I asked you to tell you, but no...

460
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:24,217
You ignored it.

461
00:27:24,217 --> 00:27:26,128
Alright, fair enough...

462
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:29,150
Everything happened so suddenly, mate... I couldn't tell anything.

463
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,959
Everything happened so suddenly, mate... I couldn't tell anything.
-I'm not a kid who'd be satisfied to hear this.

464
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:34,670
What I'd been suspecting for long has happened at last.

465
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,566
Alright, you know now, don't you?

466
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:37,670
Are you happy now?

467
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,316
You didn't even tell me now.

468
00:27:39,316 --> 00:27:43,986
Appa Bi broke the news that we're going to meet my sister-in-law in the evening.

469
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:47,957
Sorry...

470
00:27:48,457 --> 00:27:50,688
Just a sorry won't do.

471
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:54,908
How can you select my sister-in-law without my approval?

472
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:57,078
She's so good

473
00:27:57,078 --> 00:27:59,869
That you'd approve of her the moment you see her.

474
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:01,819
You have no idea

475
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,250
How tough my selection criteria are.

476
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,331
Ask her to brace herself.

477
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:09,521
You should brace yourself too. There's a surprise coming your way.

478
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,401
So confident!

479
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,921
Yes.

480
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:15,011
Are you happy?

481
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:18,104
Very.

482
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:20,975
That meets my selection criteria.

483
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,020
Thanks for understanding, man!

484
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,326
Alright, tell me, what should I wear?

485
00:28:26,326 --> 00:28:28,297
I'm so confused...

486
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,720
I think this one will work.

487
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,750
This one?

488
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,731
Yeah.

489
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:44,496
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

490
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:51,426
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

491
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:58,190
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

492
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,579
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

493
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:07,306
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

494
00:29:07,306 --> 00:29:10,379
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

495
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:13,886
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

496
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:19,516
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

497
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,126
Right...

498
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,130
Wait.

499
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,496
I'll see.

500
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,586
Yes, I'm coming.

501
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,800
Hello.
-Hello.

502
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,966
How are you?
-By the Lord's grace, I'm fine.

503
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:57,546
Hello. Please, come inside.
-Hello.

504
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:59,997
How are you, Shakira?

505
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:01,636
I'm fine.

506
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:02,457
Hello.

507
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,532
Hello.
-Hello.

508
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:05,668
Please,

509
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:07,878
Come and sit inside.

510
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:09,478
Here.

511
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,236
Come.

512
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,757
After you.

513
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,420
Mum...

514
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,500
What if Ashir and his family showed up before <i>them</i>?

515
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,900
God forbid that anything like that happen!

516
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,280
I'll serve them some tea

517
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,345
And get them going real quick.

518
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,310
Now,

519
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,590
May the Lord be so kind...

520
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,270
Ashir, Adan, quickly, now, we'll be late.

521
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,790
I'm already ready, Mum.

522
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,973
It's Ashir who's taking so long...

523
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:11,941
He's going to meet his bride. He, of all the people, would get ready proper.

524
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:13,962
In hindsight, it's good that my trip got cancelled.

525
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,716
I'd have missed all of this.

526
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:16,687
Right...

527
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:17,766
The trip

528
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:20,538
The trip you were going on on Ashir's recommendation.

529
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,738
You never turn him down.

530
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:25,650
For instance, this, right now. Here he said it, and there you agreed.

531
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,176
Because he always obeys me.

532
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:31,399
I'm a bit impish, innit, Mum?

533
00:31:31,637 --> 00:31:32,936
<i>Just</i> a bit?

534
00:31:32,936 --> 00:31:34,570
Get going already.

535
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,646
We'd get going once he's here.

536
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,040
R --

537
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,336
R -- Rehmat...

538
00:31:41,336 --> 00:31:42,526
One can't decide

539
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,256
So quickly...

540
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:47,176
Just let me

541
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:51,066
Ask Reham what she thinks...

542
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,526
What <i>Reham</i> thinks?

543
00:31:56,827 --> 00:32:00,867
Barkat, the elders have always taken decisions

544
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,917
For the daughters.

545
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,648
That's fine,

546
00:32:05,648 --> 00:32:10,870
But my Reham is different from the other daughters of the family.

547
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,651
She's educated, so what she thinks --
-Oh?

548
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:17,801
What do you want to say, Barkat?

549
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:20,082
Are our daughters unlettered?

550
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:23,725
No -- Surely, he didn't mean that -- you --

551
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,610
I can understand what you mean very well.

552
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,760
Reham's taken a liking to someone from her University.

553
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,866
This is why you're saying all of this.

554
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,806
Rehmat...

555
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:36,457
My Reham is not like that.

556
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:39,117
She'd gone to the University to study!

557
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:42,487
Girls don't <i>just</i> study,

558
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:45,750
They also find high-born suitors in the name of love.

559
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,086
They also find high-born suitors in the name of love.
-Enough!

560
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:48,667
My Reham is not like that.

561
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:49,438
Oh?

562
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:51,270
But why are you so angry, then?

563
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,480
I didn't even mention Reham.

564
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,950
It must be your conscience speaking out...

565
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,326
If that's not the case,

566
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,637
Just get Reham and Munir married.

567
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,129
But remember this, Barkat,

568
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:06,870
If Reham

569
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,410
Married someone she likes,

570
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,966
I'll make sure you're banished from the kin.

571
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,246
You'll be utterly disgraced.

572
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,456
I'm a man of great dignity.

573
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:30,026
I trust my daughter completely.

574
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,380
The day this trust breaks, I promise you,

575
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,710
You won't have to do a thing.

576
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:41,086
I swear by the Lord, I'd slit my own throat.

577
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,496
Remember this vow, Barkat,

578
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,550
And, when it's time, honour it.

579
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,230
Come, Parveen.

580
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,279
Everything's gone to waste.

581
00:34:23,279 --> 00:34:26,849
I was out of my mind to fall for everything you and Suboor had said.

582
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,220
Call him

583
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,337
And tell him

584
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,303
Not to come.

585
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,626
Haven't you heard

586
00:34:37,626 --> 00:34:40,317
What your Dad has sworn to do?

587
00:34:40,317 --> 00:34:41,438
It'd be the end of the world

588
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:43,010
If they showed up.

589
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,026
Call them quickly.

590
00:34:44,026 --> 00:34:46,248
They'd better not come.

591
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,690
It seems you're growing restless by the moment!

592
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,891
Please don't come here...

593
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,206
What happened, Reham?

594
00:35:31,206 --> 00:35:33,299
Is everything alright? Why are you crying?

595
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,249
Ashir --

596
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,680
I don't have the answer to your questions --

597
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,131
Just -- You're not coming here.

598
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:38,693
B --

599
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:40,604
B -- But you'd said --

600
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:41,795
B -- But you'd said --
-Forget it!

601
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:45,237
Just forget anything I'd ever said!

602
00:35:46,246 --> 00:35:49,459
If you have an ounce of love for me in your heart,

603
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:52,067
Just an ounce,

604
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,848
For the sake of that love,

605
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,558
Forget everything.

606
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,936
I can't pay the price of your love.

607
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,900
Hello --?

608
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,000
