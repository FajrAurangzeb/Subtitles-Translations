1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you stop there?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been in here talking to you.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your head's wet. You'll have a fever.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly, now, come in.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make sure your head's dry.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a towel.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you? Come.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why have you come upstairs? Reham's coming downstairs to teach you.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgot my notebook.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come to get it.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw your picture...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look nice.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? Do I actually look nice?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I look nice only in pictures?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't I look nice otherwise?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look very nice otherwise.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like you a lot.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may test me.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've prepared thoroughly today.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's very nice.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I bet I haven't made a single mistake.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Attempt your paper the same way tomorrow.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa Bi was right. You shouldn't have come.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've fallen ill.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just flu.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll get better.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides,

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Economics is still left --

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is it?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your book?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go home and get some rest.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd study on my own.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd study on my own. I promise.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact,

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd come with the driver to drop you home.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No,

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd go by rickshaw.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan,

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure you can do it?

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't I just promised?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me, too, that you'd take your medicines when you get back.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright then, take care.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Likewise.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been teaching Adan for a month, and you don't know he's Ashir's brother?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I find out?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I teach him in the drawing room,

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wouldn't have found out if I hadn't gone upstairs today.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, even if it is Ashir's house, why are you so worried?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor,

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm worried precisely because it's Ashir's house.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Silly lass, you should be delighted.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, you and Ashir may meet again on this pretext!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me,

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's Aunt Sofia's behaviour towards you?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's very happy with me.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Adan?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's become so attached to me.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could possibly be better?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you mad, Suboor?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fate has separated Ashir and me,

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the class and family I come from

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Decides on the basis of familial honour and prestige.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I don't want any drama.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's got four papers left.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd stop teaching him

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As soon as he's done with them.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham, think over it again.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think you're deciding it all too quickl --

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think you're deciding it all too quickl --
-No, Suboor.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no better way out.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw your picture...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look nice.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I look nice only in pictures?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't I look nice otherwise?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've sent you a separate email with the approved samples, Mum.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll start production on that quickly.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll email you the rest by next week.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's the response from the clients?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very good.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've gotten orders for almost every article.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here for a few days if you can.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, Mum, I would,

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got a ton of work.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm missing all of you a lot.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Especially His Royal Highness.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We miss you a lot, too.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And His Royal Highness has lost all his royalty now.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's completely focused on his studies now. Can you believe that?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call you in a while, Mum, I'm getting an important call.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, speaking.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday to you...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday to you...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday dear Reham...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday dear Reham...
-Seriously?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday!
-Thank you so much.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't have to do this...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, cut the cake.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Light the candles.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all thanks to him!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you've done for Adan, Reham,

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Matters so much to me that you can't even imagine.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my duty.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was the duty of his class teachers too.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they only complained about Adan.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They never tried to teach him and change him for the better.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To be honest,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's worked hard.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's studied hard, devotedly.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're the one who has taught him to work hard.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just in his studies,

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This Adan is not the old Adan.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's changed so much.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He used to be so insolent and adamant that whenever something happened against his will,

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd create a proper scene.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually,

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan just wanted attention.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so busy with the business,

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there's nobody else...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps that's why he used to react like that.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you're right.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to talk about something important.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be able to continue teaching Adan after his exams.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Reham --

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do that -- It's because of you --

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do that -- It's because of you --
-But --

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't be possible for me. I'm --

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't be possible for me. I'm -- I'm really sorry.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, you'll have

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, you'll have a lot of days after the exams... You can find a good tutor.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'd find another tutor like you!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's about the money, I can pay you more.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's about the money, I can pay you more.
-No.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like that.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm getting married.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm shifting to Lahore.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So -- How's it possible...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can understand.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't be possible.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, by the way.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please don't tell anything to Adan.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I fear that he may...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
React.
-No.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't told anything to him.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't talk to him about this

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until he's done with his exams.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd asked me to write my heart out in my diary.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This would help me improve my English handwriting.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
While writing, I figured

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That my heart only thinks of you.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It brings you up every time, in everything.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your smile,

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scolding lovingly,

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your delight at everything about me,

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your looking at my picture and saying that I look very good,

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now,

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart has grown weary of thinking of you,

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is why my heart is speaking out to you today.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking about something that you ought to hear.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd be chuffed to hear it.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't live without you.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me?</i>

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to talk to you. Don't call me again!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you okay?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so furious?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor --

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor, come here, quickly.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Reham?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you crying?

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just come here quickly.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright --

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'm coming.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Relax. Girls do huff and act coy. At least you poured your heart out.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right, mate...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But at least she should talk to me.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not even answering my call.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Patience. It takes a while.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't be patient.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've already waited so long.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want my answer now.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've stayed awake all night,

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least she should think of that.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take this. It'll help you.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've already finished a packet.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't help.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you wish.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Aunt!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're here after so long!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd left.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aunt. I'll be leaving in a few days.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But your friend doesn't seem well.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's locked herself in her room. Hasn't even had her breakfast.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, get us some tea. I'll take a look at her.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, go. I'll get you tea.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum -- I --

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever the dickens has happened, Reham?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Disgusting!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This Adan!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to Aunt Sofia.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to know that Adan --

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, I'll -- Call Ashir.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, I'll -- Call Ashir.
-No.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not telling anything to Ashir.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's angry with me, mate.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 4.30 and she's not here yet.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I say,

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll not talk to you for a few days, and everything will be fine after that.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if not?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she's angry with me, like, forever?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look,

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and message her,

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you don't need to start with 'Sorry' and all.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish I'd known her address.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd have gone there myself.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's an idea. Come to the club.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll distract you a little.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I don't want to.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, I'll tell you.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, I'll tell you. Okay, bye.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't a trifle.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have to tell Ashir.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd go out of hand.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Ashir think about me?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even tell Mrs Sofia.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think about it, Suboor.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What exactly

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has Adan done?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With this, he's not broken not just his own, but my trust as well.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to think of him as my brother.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took my love

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In such a wrong way...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to explain yourself.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Adan's fault, and it's not something so insignificant that --

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even believe it

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's claiming to be in love with you.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just a kid!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's this Adan?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you going?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham would be here anytime now. It's time for your tuition.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's usually here by now.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you called her?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not answering.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not answering?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's never done this before.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's usually here on time.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't misbehaved with her, have you?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would I do anything, Appa Bi?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bu -- W --

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Aunt, it's not like it's Reham's fault, is it?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always thought of Adan like a bro --
-'Thinking' of someone as a brother doesn't make him one.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I'm angry about

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is why she didn't tell me

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she's going to teach a young lad!

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's a kid!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This --
-'Kid'!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
15-something. This is the age of such naïveté!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Emotions go out of control of the mind,

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this is the age when the Devil leads people astray.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's there for hours on end, teaching him!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're in an absolute mire!

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One, because of that Ashir,

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And two, because of his younger brother.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't you find anyone else to tutor?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, I swear I didn't know that it wa --

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, I swear I didn't know that it was Ash --
-You can swear all you want,

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say anything you want,

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever your intentions have been,

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People will only speak ill about you.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if word about this got to your Dad,

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd die of disgrace!

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What have you done, Reham?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt,

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody will find out anything.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd tell that imbecile?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about his family?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what if his mother found out?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd not go there now, Mum.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a few days,

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan will grow tired and understand.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't worry.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A load of worry has been written in my destiny!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, Reham,

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better sit at home now.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no need for you to work.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the day I've always warned you about.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tasted the consequences yourself?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, suffer!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There must be something.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham's otherwise quite responsible in this regard.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa,

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be busy at the office for the next few days.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be back by 11.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A delegation's here,

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's important that we make a deal with them.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you tiring yourself so much with your hard work?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord's grace, Ashir's managing the entire business.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd tire myself if I didn't work.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, it's not just a business. It's become a part of my life.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Either way,

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of your health.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of your health.
-What happened to my health?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm perfectly alright.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you like it. Do as you please.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll meet Adan after dinner.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to leave early in the morning. Won't be able to meet him then.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So busy now that you haven't even got time for Mum?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mum...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Exams...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to score good marks for you.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so proud of you, my dear.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your current dedication

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is enough to satisfy me.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, you and I are going on a vacation after the exams.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wherever you want to.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A gift to you.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From me.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if I wanted something else as a gift?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask for anything you want.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything, for your happiness.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes, Appa told me that Reham didn't come today.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me her number, I should call her to ask wh --

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me her number, I should call her to ask wh --
-I talked to her, Mum. She's not well; she'd be here tomorrow.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some rest.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Moiz?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Found out anything yet?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, mate.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't no rocket science to trace a number to an address.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got it.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll text it to you.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, mate.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have to go there, bro.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let her know you have her address.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd call you herself.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, my dear?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you unwell?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing really, Dad. Just a headache.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, then, you ought to see a doctor.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm taking you to a doctor right now.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That won't be necessary.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm better. I've taken a pill.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Satisfied?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I tell you it's nothing to be worried about?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shakira,

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I be at peace when my daughter's in pain?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My peace of mind and happiness is in my daughter's peace.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's really nothing to get worried about, Dad.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get better with some rest.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, then.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some rest.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And let me know if it doesn't get better.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll go to the doctor quickly.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Dad.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you didn't talk to me, I'm coming to your place.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Threatening me, eh?

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't you talking to me?
-Shut up!

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you've done

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is so low and cheap!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd talk to you now?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever load of rubbish you have in your heart and mind,

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dump it out.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And from now on, never call or message me again.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not even coming to teach you.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not even coming to teach you.
-You can't do that.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because if you did, I'd do exactly

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As I said.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not a threat.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd come --
-Enough!

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not here for this cod,

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor have I given in to your threats,

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor here to hear the filth that your mind is full of.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come here to make you understand.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come here to make you understand.
-I'm far beyond the point where I'd 'understand'.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if you understood my feelings --

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if you understood my feelings --
-'Feelings'?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is pure naïveté, not 'feelings'!

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you even think like this, Adan?

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you even think like this, Adan?
-Love never thinks.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ours was a relationship of honour, respect and admiration,

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you've blown to smithereens.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The fault is mine.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I could expect you to honour this relationship,

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And maintain its dignity!

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen to this clearly -

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget all of this,

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And focus on your studies.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not possible for me to forget!

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, it's not as if it's a crime to love!

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be done with it!

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be done with it already, Adan!

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say another word!

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From now on,

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not calling me,

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not texting me.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we're not meeting either.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep this with you!

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
