1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very sorry to hear everything that's happened to you.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please, try and talk to your Mum about it.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would have, if only she'd honoured our relationship.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd ask for your forgiveness.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can, forgive me for everything that's happened to Reham.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to apologise.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's enough for me that my innocent Reham has braved every trial.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Aunt...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've wronged you as much as Reham.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm calling you my son, and you're testing my sincerity.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask parents for blessings. Not forgiveness.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord keep the two of you happy. Always.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look what we have here! Regaling the son-in-law and daughter!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are they here, Mum?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who let them in?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A daughter needs no permission to meet her mother.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not talking to you.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better. Because I brought Reham here.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll be here again, and you better not say that next time.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham's been proven innocent of what you were punishing her for.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't matter now that she's innocent, Shakira.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The people say all sorts of things.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't give two hoots, and I'm sorry...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, more than anyone else, it was those we held dear who said all sorts of things when Reham was accused!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should we forget our disgrace just because that scrote's forgiven his brother's murder?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen Reham meet that boy in the park myself!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave anything out, Munir.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's true that Reham had gone to meet him, to make him understand.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You took advantage of it and forced her to marry you, or you'd disgrace her before everyone!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aunt --

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever, Shakira!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if she didn't come here again.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's her mother's place.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're forgetting, Shakira, that this house is now my daugh --
-And you're forgetting that your daughter's my wife!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better if Reham got no trouble from you.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you still think I was wrong?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The deed is done, Sofia...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it matter...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it does matter

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether you think what you did was wrong.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he never came back.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he were innocent, why didn't he?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked him to get out of the house, Sofia.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't remember him ever disobeying you.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether it's something for him... Or against him.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard what everyone else said and declared him guilty.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it matter, now, indeed,

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he says something in his defence.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look into your heart, Sofia.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That in some nook, somewhere,

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find proof of the boy's love and sincerity.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, I'll be there tomorrow.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Thank you very much.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd applied for a job.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've called me for an interview.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Reham?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you happy?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you've decided you're going to stay here...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is our home now, Reham.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're starting our life here now,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Untouched by any bitter memories of the past.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what are you starting our life with?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our happiness.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yours and mine.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it'll give me enough strength to put up a smile after everything we've lost.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll need you right by my side, Reham.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Appa Bi, I'm trying my best, but he just won't give in.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep on trying, Reham.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he will,

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someday.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, are you fine?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine...?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea, Appa Bi...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm restless with this strange sense of guilt.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never wanted any of this to happen.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Ashir -- be estranged from Aunt -- because of me...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, despite everything...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham...

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be silly.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None of this is your fault.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know how it feels

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To have family snatched away, Appa Bi...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know how much it hurts having to explain yourself...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And watch their trust

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shatter...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everything.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can understand how Aunt and Ashir feel.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sadly, there's nothing I can do.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm helpless.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never think that there's nothing you can do.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how much it eases me that you're with Ashir.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of him and yourself, okay?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Appa Bi.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of yourself... And Aunt.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, my dear.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked him to get out of the house, Sofia.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't remember him ever disobeying you.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether it's something for him... Or against him.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard what everyone else said and declared him guilty.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it matter, now, indeed,

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he says something in his defence.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look into your heart, Sofia.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That in some nook, somewhere,

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find proof of the boy's love and sincerity.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sir, an account this big has never been transferred from the company to anyone's personal account.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I say I have nothing to do with it, Haroon?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened sir? Neither you, nor Madame are coming to office.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think it's something I should tell you about.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think I've got nothing to do with anything at the office.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you think Mr Taufiq's doing something wrong, you have the right to let Madame know.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't disturb me.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir --

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But sir --

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got to do something.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what he's got on his mind!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I do, Reham?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's given him the authority herself.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We know just why.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked Haroon to tell Mum.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else can I do?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa Bi! Tell her about it.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've already got so many issues with Appa Bi.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to create new problems for her.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What hasn't Mum done for Uncle Taufiq...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he's always greedy for more.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe Mum can't see it.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps because there's something else that troubles her right now...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Soreness and silence always makes us soft targets.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Aunt's wrong,

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, in a way, are you.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't meet her if you don't want to.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be cross with her if you want to.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you know someone's taking advantage of her, it's your duty, Ashir, to save her.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor!

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going, Fesl. Don't even think of following me.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't be able to stop me by the time you get back from office.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'd be furious, but the truth is, you would never have let me go if I'd asked.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't live with this guilt anymore, Fesl.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone lost his life because of my mistake,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And another's life is ruined because of me.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just can't live my life with no care for any of it, Fesl.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no idea what Ashir will do to me,

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But trust me,

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even care now.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll accept whatever punishment he sees meet.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're free to do whatever you want about our relationship.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I found out after I got home, Uncle.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should never have left her in that condition, Fesl.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know she's so adamant!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I had any idea she'd --
-Oh God...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When will she be here?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a few hours?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll handle it. I'm sending someone to the airport.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does Ashir or that girl know she's coming?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're her husband. You could've handled it!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, Uncle, but...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This was dead and buried long ago...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll do something.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll take care.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's everyone? It's time for breakfast...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Taufiq left for office.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Appa would rather have breakfast in her room.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Farah?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Farah isn't really well... She's in her room.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know Farah's cross with me.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why she doesn't come to me.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just a bit... disturbed.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After everything that's happened...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just natural...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tasnim...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hadn't taken responsibility for Farah with Ashir in mind.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and Taufiq don't need to worry.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She is, and will be, my responsibility.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, after everything that's happened, it's my duty to decide what's best for her future.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And so I will...

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was wrong of you to come here without telling Fesl.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's your husband, Suboor.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's told you why I'm here.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He has.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And frankly, I'm hardly surprised at your silliness.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is precisely what I expected from you.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least someone's lived up to someone's expectations!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I expected a lot from you, too.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd stand by me.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, regrettably...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stand by you in what?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told you before

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That what you intend to do is utter stupidity!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would they forgive you after knowing the truth?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want forgiveness, Dad!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here for my punishment.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be crazy.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not alone.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got family.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's me.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fesl...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If anything happened to you, it'd pain us, too!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm in pain, too.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why can't any of you see?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've hurt Reham as much as I could.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly? I'm no happier at what's happened.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Dad...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever they want to do...

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm ready for it.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mad!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Raving mad!

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimming imbecile...

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd come to me and quarrel.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be angry with me.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Complain.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would have, Aunt...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the one who's left had been my own...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not in my case...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What good will it be to be cross or complain?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir's hurt you so much, I --
-No, Aunt.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've hurt myself.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I think that's what you're doing to yourself.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've realised

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That happiness is never won through plunder...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not calling to ask why you did that to me.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to bless you in your new life.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The life you always wanted.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With Reham. Your love.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew about Reham and you, but I was foolish to think I could conquer you...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But no longer...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm setting you free from what was never meant to be...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no complaints or regret.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been three days!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why hasn't the money been transferred?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's against the company's policy, sir.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The amount's too big to transfer to a personal accoun --
-Then, change the company's policy.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's our company, and it'll be our policy.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll need Madame's permission.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's never transferred to her own account or M. Ashir's --
-And Madame Sofia's put me in-charge, right?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's given me the right.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you better do as I say.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're buying materials from a new vendor. He's selling at half the price!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no room for an official transaction. Too much fuss with the tax department folks. That's why.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will be responsible for any losses we suffer.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and do what I asked you to.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir's hurt you so much, I --
-No, Aunt.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've hurt myself.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I think that's what you're doing to yourself.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Haroon?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There was a problem I wanted to discuss with you, ma'am.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M. Taufiq's asked me to transfer this huge sum to his personal account.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told him it's against the company's policy, but he scolded me and asked me to do it, no matter what.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told him we'd need your permission, but he said it'll be as he pleases, because he's in charge.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's also stopped all the ongoing orders.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, all the ongoing projects are on hold. He's starting with new ones.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Haroon.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to him.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of it.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
