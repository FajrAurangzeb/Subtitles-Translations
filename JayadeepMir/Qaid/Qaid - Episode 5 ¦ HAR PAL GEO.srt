1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's your 'tuition',

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your 'respectable job',

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Uncle takes so much pride in!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You --

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mistaken...
-Right or wrong,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mistaken...
-Right or wrong, explain it to Uncle.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let go of her! Get off her!
-Please, I beg you!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you said so much as a word,

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd kill you

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And bury you right here.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd he gone so early?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I ask you not to go?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I say that you're not going anywhere?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't go anywhere, Mum.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I had to explain it to Adan for once.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you'd gone to meet him!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to create trouble?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you understand?
-Nothing's going to happen, Mum.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There won't be any trouble.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open the door, mate, what's the matter?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm studying.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even have breakfast. Have something.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've had breakfast over at my friend's. You may go, Appa Bi.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never bothered to study,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now he's so much into studies that he doesn't bother to eat.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Life has come to a halt; time is vexed</i>

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Each moment seemingly centurial</i>

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The reverie of love rewarded me with damnation</i>

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Even my home stings at me</i>

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Miasmic and etiolated, loathy is this garth</i>

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, Barkat,

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You educated Reham.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We accepted it, although not wholeheartedly.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, she's going out to teach, and we're quiet on it, too,

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we've told everyone in the family about Reham and Munir's marriage,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With the hope

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you won't turn us down.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now,

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's asking us the same thing.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else do we have to tell this?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We come here, almost begging,

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you kick us out every single time.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me,

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing like that in our hearts.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You are our elders and we will always respect that.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granted, Barkat,

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Munir is not as educated as Reham,

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who cares about a man's education?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have everything the Lord could've given us,

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Munir

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will be running the factory after me.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord keep you well...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not opposing anything you've said.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I want is that Reham's consent --
-Dad...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no objections to this match.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Appa, it'll take another hour.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's some more work to do.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness... Working all the time! Did you have anything at all?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, what is Adan doing?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite the thing to ask, really!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's life revolves entirely around his studies now.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's always got his head buried in his books.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's splendid!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Appa, someone's calling me,

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't wait for me. Go to bed.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright. Try to come back quickly.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, okay.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sent the presentation, right?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's fine.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, thank you.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to you, Shakira!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to you, too.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a Friday the day after tomorrow.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could be a more blessed day, Barkat?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd be coming with the wedding procession.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could it be so quickly?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, shan,

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the problem with you now, Barkat?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham's accepted it herself now.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No --

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not about having a problem, but...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One's got to prepare.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of preparations, Barkat?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, Shakira would've set apart clothes and jewellery?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no big deal if she hasn't, though.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not as if we'd desire anything of the sort...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not going to be married off to a stranger.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's coming over to her Uncle's home.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're bringing the procession the day after tomorrow.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no pressure on you, my dear.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry about anything your Uncle and Aunt have said,

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor about

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What everyone in the family would say.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir and you --
-You have faith in me, don't you, Dad?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd ever take a decision

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's bad for me?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, who could be dearer than one's own?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all but family.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you be happy?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Dad.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if anything goes wrong,

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're there.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's there.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle and Aunt...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All the elders can call us down.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I went over to an outsider,

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be all alone...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about your entire life, my dear.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still, if you want, you can think about it through the night, and tell me in the morn --
-My decision would be the same in the morning.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my fault.
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my fault.
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I expected that you'd respect our relationship
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I expected that you'd respect our relationship
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And honour it!
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From now on,
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From now on,
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not calling or messaging me!
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir, please listen to me -- Munir!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle was acting so stuck-up with his 'honour'!

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Swearing by your virtuousness and chastity!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All his pride will shatter now.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mistaken...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd just come here --
-To give him a lovely little gift! I've seen everything!

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that --
-Whatever it's like,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell Uncle.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, why just him,

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M -- Munir...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was because of your good and virtuous name, innit, that my family had been insulted and sent back?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and explain yourself to everyone.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Munir, you aren't doing this!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whom are you calling?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whom are you calling?
-Dad!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that he can gather everyone and chronicle your escapades.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Flirting around with a schoolboy in the name of 'tuition'!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all wrong!
-Oh?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray tell, what's the truth?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can take Romeo along if you want.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone will see whatever happens next.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone will see whatever happens next.
-No, Munir!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I beg you, Munir...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't tell Dad, he'd die to hear it!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll agree to marry you.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say yes.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, don't tell anything to Dad!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! Hear this call; why is my road engulfed in darkness</i>

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pronounce a judgement now</i>

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>From the Heavens as You see meet</i>

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With my head bowed, I accept...</i>

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look,

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One can't sever all ties with one's family.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is what Rehmat wanted, innit?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Reham become his daughter-in-law.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she was so little,

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He used to say, 'She's my daughter'.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And about Munir being less educated,

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When a man and his wife love each other,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one pays any heed to it.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Shakira, I know.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't know why...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Despite a million attempts, I cannot calm my heart down.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, comfort your heart, thinking

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That whatever the Lord has ordained

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the best.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how will it all happen so quickly?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We haven't prepared at all.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mothers start preparing for their daughter's weddings

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From the moment one is born.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything will be alright.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had just two options, Suboor.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There was Dad's head bowed in disgrace on one side,

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a life worse than hell with Munir on the other.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But believe me,

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The second would hurt me less.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If there's something my Dad prides himself on,

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If there's something my Dad prides himself on, it's me.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's struggled all his life to earn this honour.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the only wealth he has.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't be so selfish as to plunder all of it.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham,

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd said that he isn't satisfied with your decision.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try to tell your side of the story for once.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't any good.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir would make so much noise

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it would crush my side of the story and my innocence.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad won't be able to take it.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My side of the story and my innocence mean nothing before Dad's life.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham,

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How would you carry on?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --
-I'd have to, Suboor.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or everything will be ruined.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't spare Adan.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's responsible for everything.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll let Aunt Sofia --
-You're not telling anyone anything.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's already happened.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ought to be punished, too.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't do any good.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell anyone anything.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget her.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like there's just one girl in the world.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just her to me.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do now?

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk again.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her again and again until she listens to me.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't love you.
-She does.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not accepting it just because she's older than me.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her family will create problems, her Mum won't agree.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd convince everyone if only she agreed.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think she'd talk to you again?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd have to.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't do this to me.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praise the Lord.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This gown would suit my daughter-in-law so well.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's really beautiful.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare call my daughter your 'daughter-in-law'.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She gives my heart peace. That's why I worry so much for her.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope there isn't any bitterness now.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your heart is at ease now, isn't it?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What bitterness, Shakira?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just say it all for your good.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There isn't any need for me to be angry or bitter now that you've understood.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, Barkat,

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry one bit about Reham.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise you

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd love her like my daughter.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seeing Dad call her a 'daughter' with so much love,

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a bit worried nobody's going to remember me when she's here.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment Reham comes home, I'd ask him

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To start preparing for your marriage.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rubina,

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take these away,

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The guests would be coming for the Mayoon [ritual].

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's right.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows who's coming to celebrate, and who's coming to curse our happiness?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly, now, take these away.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll help her.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Moiz, I'd need your bike.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Everything good?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need it, mate!

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, come and get it.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mate,

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting married so suddenly?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's alright, innit?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd grown tired of waiting.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's agreed at last.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
However did she agree?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wouldn't even look your way.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not as if this guy's so worthless.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had to agree.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some good deed would've gotten you this reward.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't hope for any reward in the Afterlife now that you've gotten it in this world.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, there's one good deed of yours...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get us some tea, guv!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why just tea?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A dinner is deserved, given this good news...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From him!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Old chap's gonna become a groom.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it, mate.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it, mate.
-He's acting coy!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's place the order, shall we?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mustaqim!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Congratulations on your wedding'!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this Miss Reham's house?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this Miss Reham's house?
-Yes.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, all of his...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's getting married tomorrow.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, mate?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whom do you want to meet?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry,

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd come to the wrong address.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, well...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, well...
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe this.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way everything's happening...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not believing in it cannot change the situation...

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You aren't ready yet...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was about to get ready.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why you accepted this proposal.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember this -

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If anything goes wrong now,

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides whatever your Dad would do,

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would kill myself.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would kill myself.
<i>Life has come to a halt; time is vexed</i>

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Life has come to a halt; time is vexed</i>

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Each moment seemingly centurial</i>

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The reverie of love rewarded me with damnation</i>

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Even my home stings at me</i>

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's getting married tomorrow.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're getting married.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better stop or it'll be very bad.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This stupid kid is getting on my nerves.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you doing this to me?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me through to Reham right now. I need to talk to her.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's outside.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't talk right now.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't do this with me.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she be so selfish?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know anything, I need to talk to her right now.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she betray me?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get you through in 10 minutes.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on? Why aren't you out of this room yet?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praise the Lord!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My daughter looks so beautiful!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who were you quarreling with?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Miss Reham's very selfish.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm having exams, and she took a leave...

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I called her, she said she can't come.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Regardless,

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One doesn't talk this way, young man.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Haroon?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'm coming.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Okay, bye.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going to talk to her now.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her myself tomorrow.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

389

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't answer the phone. Text me.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please believe my love...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't go forth with this marriage, Reham.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be done with this guff, Adan!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you believe me,

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you believe that I've fallen in love with you?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care about your love.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget me.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do this...

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me...

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go top yourself!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was Adan saying?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The old load of cod.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love, amour...

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't get married'...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you say?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I say?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave him an earful and switched the phone off.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say you shouldn't worry so much either.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've already ruined yourself.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd come to his senses on his own,

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And trust me,

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It could all be a distasteful prank

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To act and look 'cool' before his friends.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My driver's here.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, get some rest.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a lot of torment to go through tomorrow.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish I'd gone to America already

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I can't see you with that Munir bloke tomorrow.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about a beach trip on Sunday?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, done.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guys,

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Matey's live on Facebook.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you punishing me for?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was my sin?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I fell in love with you?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of respect for our relationship, I'd not mention your name,

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd prove to the world that I love you.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That is cheap,

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a load of guff just because you're older than me.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe this

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe this rubbish!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe in any of it.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does one fall in love after thinking about all of this?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If that's so,

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then...

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talking so lovingly to me,

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Smiling for me,

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking me to write my heart's feelings...

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was all of that?

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just an act?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't mean any of it?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've done what you wanted to.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My turn.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Top yourself'.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you'd said, innit?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll top myself.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you,

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And for my love.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him! Call him!

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

475
