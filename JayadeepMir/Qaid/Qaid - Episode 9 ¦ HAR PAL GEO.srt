00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,510
Did you tell the lawyer that our daughter is innocent?

2
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:25,933
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

3
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:32,653
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

4
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:39,683
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

5
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:44,993
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

6
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:48,782
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

7
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:51,903
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

8
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,423
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r,' O Bulleya,</i>

9
00:14:55,423 --> 00:15:01,043
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

10
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:13,227
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

11
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:18,313
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

12
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:26,983
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

13
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:32,513
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

14
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:39,513
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

15
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:46,953
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

16
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:55,014
<i>O Lord! Hear this call; why is my road engulfed in darkness</i>

17
00:15:55,014 --> 00:16:01,864
<i>Pronounce a judgement now</i>

18
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:08,706
<i>From the Heavens as You see meet</i>

19
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:15,073
<i>With my head bowed, I accept</i>

20
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:21,973
<i>I am lost in this rout of woe</i>

21
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:26,853
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

22
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:22,293
<i>Life has come to a halt; time is vexed</i>

23
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:29,023
<i>Each moment seemingly centurial</i>

24
00:30:29,273 --> 00:30:35,952
<i>The reverie of love rewarded me with damnation</i>

25
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:42,466
<i>Even my home stings at me</i>

26
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:49,152
<i>Miasmic and etiolated, loathy is this garth</i>

27
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:56,043
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

28
00:30:56,043 --> 00:31:02,954
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

29
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:09,966
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

30
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:30,703
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

31
00:31:30,703 --> 00:31:37,111
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

32
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:44,433
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

33
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:49,795
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

34
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:53,502
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

35
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:56,658
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

36
00:31:56,658 --> 00:32:00,104
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r,' O Bulleya,</i>

37
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:05,733
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
