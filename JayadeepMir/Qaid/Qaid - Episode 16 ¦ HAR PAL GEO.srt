1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long will you keep on grieving over your oul fella?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's so much work to do...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So many clothes. Come and iron them!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may go. I'm coming.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, seriously!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were sitting about like an empress.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And listen,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't give in to the misbelief

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That everyone here would pity you and feel for you because your oul fella's died.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want anyone to pity me,

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please don't talk about my Dad like this.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may go. I'm coming.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough with this drama already.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better know your place.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Iron my clothes.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, take a seat.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call her here.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Appa?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's Headmistress is here. She wants to meet you.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have her sit; I'm coming.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd been thinking for a while

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd pay you a visit.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't think how I could convey my condolences.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, I thought I'd come today on the pretext of sharing his result.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me,

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The news of Adan's death shook the entire staff.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps a life only so long had been destined for him...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at this.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's result.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the grace of the Lord, he's scored an A* in all subjects.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing here?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd ironed your shirt...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wha --

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who asked you to iron my shirt?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd--
-How dare you touch my shirt?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd wear a shirt ironed by you?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's useless to me now!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen carefully to this.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't enter my room again,

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't touch any of my things!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He used to hate accountancy and physics...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd say,

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I won't do well'

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'No matter how hard I study'.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he's scored the best marks in these two subjects.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After Adan started his tuition,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He changed completely.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe that it was his tutor who led him to...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She used to teach him so well...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact,

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd become a very good boy. He'd improved greatly.

69
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:35,692
Please,

70
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:36,822
Have your tea.

71
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:38,972
It's getting cold.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you touch my shirt?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd wear a shirt ironed by you?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's useless to me now!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much longer --

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you just do, you crazy woman?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I didn't see --

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry -- I --

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd patch this up...

80
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,248
You didn't see, eh?

81
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:34,437
Let me see how you like them apples!
-What are you doing, Farah?

82
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:35,646
Farah, what are you doing?

83
00:07:35,646 --> 00:07:36,766
My hand -- Farah!

84
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:37,486
Farah!

85
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:41,207
Farah, please, let go of my hand!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I don't get is

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why your sister has let that girl stay!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's ready to kick her out everyday.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's ordered her to leave many times, too but --

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's ordered her to leave many times, too but --
-But she doesn't kick her out, does she?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's still here!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what Aunt wants!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you know what she wants?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The flames of revenge for her young son's death burn in her heart.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why she's kept her here. She wants to exact her revenge.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Revenge?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this how one exacts revenge?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes scolding, sometimes staring, and sometimes kicking her away.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this how one avenges the death of one's young son?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this how one exacts revenge?

101
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,162
I'll tell Aunt how to exact revenge.

102
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:48,553
She burnt my shirt; I burnt her hand.

103
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:51,193
What?

104
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:52,673
Burnt her hand?

105
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:54,104
Yes, I did.

106
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,654
She's gone mad!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever would her anger do?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she's done anything wrong!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was just right.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you having sympathy for that Reham?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get it. You can't understand it.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you kept on with this,

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir and Sofia would grow to sympathise with her!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From now on, you're not doing anything!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me handle everything.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Daft lass.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I burnt her hand'!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my fault again!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed,

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed, there's no need to sell your father's shop.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think, Mum?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd eat up all the money I'd get from selling Dad's shop?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what she thinks, innit?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd waste every penny of it.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would he waste it?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd invest it in the business.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of business?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad had been running a shop,

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you take his place?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if it's earning us any riches!

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you'd start a business that would earn us any riches!

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, I'm --

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll invest in Uncle's business.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see, once the business gets going, the times will change for us.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shakira, don't be adamant over every single thing.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him sell the shop to start his business.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless him.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, it's not as if you have anyone else.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's his.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan would've been so happy to see his result...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Appa...

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very happy.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what kind of reward he'd have asked me for...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange, innit?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He almost had an aversion to books.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hated studies...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then, there came Reham,

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who taught him to love books.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She should just have taught him to love books.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did she ensnare him in her love?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's possible

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Reham tried to explain to Adan...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talked about this to him, but...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know our Adan was always the stubborn type...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was, sure.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Insolent, too.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A good-for-nothing, too.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not so low and vile.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never even said anything of the sort about his class fellows, Appa.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never even made fun of them.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- Reham was much older than him...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone his age...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is --

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is -- utterly puerile...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The first face one finds pretty

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stays close to one's heart forever.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When one grows attached

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To those close to him.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever, Appa...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all Reham's fault.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She could've talked to me.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She told me everything about Adan.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't she tell me this?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was her selfish greed.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what killed my son.

185
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,785
You're bigly balky!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always looking for an excuse to retreat to your room!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you ever feel like doing anything?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd wash the mountain of dishes lying in the kitchen?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My hand hurts a lot...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just a tiny burn.

192
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,453
How much could that hurt?

193
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:14,993
Don't try these lame excuses with me.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be able to do the dishes.

195
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:22,418
How dare you

196
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:25,159
Argue back to me?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me work on that.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see how you avoid doing the dishes!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come along!
-Don't --

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!
-Please, don't grab this hand --

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!
-It hurts!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please let go!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, let go. It hurts a lot!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough with this act! You're not in any pain, are you?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough with this act! You're not in any pain, are you?
-Please let go...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come! Why have you stopped?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!
-Please --

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you tormenting yourself, Reham?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me wash them.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No,

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's alright, I can wash them.

214
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:36,346
Have you applied any medicine on your hand?

215
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,717
I'd applied some toothpaste.

216
00:16:38,717 --> 00:16:40,158
That's the blooming limit.

217
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:43,258
'Applied some toothpaste'!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it. Over here.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said leave it. Put that down.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the bloomin' limit.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does toothpaste help heal wounds? Sit.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it hurt?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He almost had an aversion to books.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hated studies...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then, there came Reham, who taught him to love books.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then, there came Reham, who taught him to love books.
-She should just have taught him to love books.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did she ensnare him in her love?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's possible

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Reham tried to explain to Adan...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talked about this to him, but...

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know our Adan was always the stubborn type...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was, sure.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Insolent, too.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A good-for-nothing, too.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not so low and vile.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She used to teach him so well...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact,

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd become a very good boy. He'd improved greatly.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, Mum.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once my business is up and running,

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why just one shop,

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We could open many.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so at ease?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you have so much patience?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd brought you here to punish you,

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To torment you and make you suffer.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so at peace?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you made of stone?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you feel any pain or humiliation?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you just leave?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you shouldn't be left with any desire to punish me.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Punish you?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've become my punishment.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd brought you here a prisoner, but find myself immured!

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's the flames of revenge for Adan raging on one side,

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And on the other, I'm restless over why

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No bit of misery or cruelty meted out to you

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gives me any peace.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do I only grow more restless?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're responsible for all that's happening,

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I can't take it anymore.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want an end to this, Reham.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can only end it one way.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kill the one who's responsible.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not so weak and heartless as you

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd kill another human.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, it can't be easy to kill, can it?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't killed anyone.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even kill a bug crawling on the floor.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Avarice can give strength to the weakest among us.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Avarice?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Avarice, Ashir?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're saying this to me?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Monseigneur Ashir,

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it had been avarice, Ashir, securing wealth was easy for me.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back when you were ready to die for me!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd come with a marriage proposal --

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was the one who had rejected it!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Lord alone can testify about my innocence.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have nothing else to say

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my defence.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan,

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see your marks in physics and accountancy?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, I did.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan, I'm serious.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And why are your marks in Urdu so low?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear,

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what you'll do...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I don't know why you're so worried.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd become a great businessman one day, Mum,

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take care of everything.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd become a great businessman,

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take care of everything?

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All without a degree?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who have their own business don't need a degree, Mum.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, it's not as if I have to apply to a company for a job.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan, I'm serious!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm in no mood for jokes.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very worried to see this report card.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now, Mum. Don't get so worried...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had no worries about Ashir's studies.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd study on his own.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear,

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This business and I --

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what tomorrow may hold?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that, Mum...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I promise I'll concentrate on my studies and score good marks.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't make false promises to me.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, if I scored good marks, what'd be my reward?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever you want.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, I'd ask for something really big.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd give you

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever you ask for.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then,

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Start a company in my name

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like you've started one in Ashir's name.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All its profit would be mine.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can get whichever tutor you want to teach me.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My Lord...</i>

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Avarice?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Avarice, Ashir?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're saying this to me?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Monseigneur Ashir,

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it had been avarice, Ashir, securing wealth was easy for me.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back when you were ready to die for me!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd come with a marriage proposal --

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was the one who had rejected it!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Lord alone can testify about my innocence.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have nothing else to say

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my defence.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rubina, get me my breakfast quick, I'll be opening the shop late.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you wait?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting late...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you'd earn

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any good dough running that shop.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever,

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's currently my only source of income.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How we'd run the household

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I closed the shop.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We were about to strike a great deal about that shop.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was wrong with us investing a few bucks in the business with Dad?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It would've benefited you, of all the people.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But your Mum's

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost seized control of it, and won't even let us talk about this.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Dad had this house transferred over to me in the marriage contract.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, your Mum

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May have thrown me out of here.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's nothing like that.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's not bad at heart.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was at her insistence that Dad had transferred this house over to you.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, why is she adamant about the shop?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't exactly have a loving relationship with her either...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she showers her affection on me!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever, Rubina,

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's my Mum.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd have to live with her on cordial terms.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see,

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll agree about the shop, too.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll try that, too.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I know Aunt very well.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't even agree if I took care of her.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try for once, will you?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

387
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:49,196
Aren't you going to the office?

388
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:55,139
I'm rather unwell...

389
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:57,530
God forbid, do you have a fever?

390
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,843
I'm not <i>that</i> unwell.</i>

391
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:04,542
Right now, I'm more concerned about your condition

392
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,112
Than your health.

393
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:13,862
What could happen to my condition, Appa Bi?

394
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:22,556
Sometimes, when the noise around grows louder,

395
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:26,866
One should look within.

396
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:32,911
It's the sinner who should look within.

397
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:39,312
Sometimes, when we look within,

398
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:42,882
We see the faces of those oppressed

399
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:44,863
Whom we,

400
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:48,849
Knowingly sometimes and sometimes not,

401
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,158
View as sinners.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does that mean?

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need to rest.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll leave you to yourself.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I didn't quite get what you were saying...

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like me to have breakfast sent here?

407
00:35:12,874 --> 00:35:14,844
I'd like some coffee.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
