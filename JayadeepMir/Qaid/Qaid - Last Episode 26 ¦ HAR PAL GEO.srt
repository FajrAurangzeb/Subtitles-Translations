1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My designation ain't that good... But not that bad either!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In time, everything will be alright.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know if we're running out of rations and all...

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got all we need.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would I do that, when I know how upright you are?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why would Haroon saying so?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew this would happen...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My presence is costing a lot of them a lot!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, Taufiq?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you hadn't gone to the office for quite some time after Adan, you know...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir and Haroon were in-charge of every right and wrong...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They did as they pleased.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many times we spent above the budget!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many tenders we got at higher prices!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost count! And you may remember how he couldn't really explain the loss in Australia.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Holding them to account would definitely birth some sourness!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to hurt you,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But someone who's been up to monkey business with ties of blood might as well do it with the money.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd stay away from it.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all I can do.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep doing your work.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back at the office in a few days.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm pleased to hear that.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the devil do you mean?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's going anywhere! We're staying!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's stopping you?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm leaving.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't be a part of your game any longer.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Farah?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?
-Please, Mum...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't try to explain or put one over on me.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've made my decision.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would decide what we'd do, eh?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm still here!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Taufiq...
-Hold on!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me be very clear, young lady -

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't let

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I've worked so hard for

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slip by so easily!

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor would I let anyone - not even you - stop things when they're falling into place!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want me to let go of everything for you and Ashir?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I'm saying, Dad --
-You better not say a word!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just listen to what I'm saying.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's what's best for all of us.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't doubt your mother's love.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen in her eyes the fear of losing you.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Many have taken advantage of it.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wouldn't she think

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you've broken her trust?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Ashir...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one matters to me more than you, and I'm with you in every decision you take.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't stay quiet with the knowledge that your ties with her are soured just because of a misunderstanding.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Soreness and silence always makes us soft targets.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Aunt's wrong,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, in a way, are you.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't meet her if you don't want to.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be cross with her if you want to.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you know someone's taking advantage of her, it's your duty, Ashir, to save her.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're getting married,

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better stop or it'll be very bad.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please believe my love...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't go forth with this marriage, Reham.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care about your love.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget me.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do this...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go top yourself!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa Bi!

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you, Taufiq?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get back, quick!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, is everything alright? I'm at the office.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing's alright!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Tell me!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's back!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's meeting Appa!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not Reham...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suboor!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- couldn't think -- of anything.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was very afraid...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't imagine

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Adan would do something like that...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I admit it's -- my fault...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should've told him...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could've told this earlier...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the fear of being punished held me back...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- I can't live with this guilt anymore...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I've wronged

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham and Ashir...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No less than you and Adan...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My silence...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ruined everyone's lives...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not asking for forgiveness...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm asking to be punished.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Punish me however you like.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd accept it...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you trust her?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's her proof?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Taufiq...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would anyone take something like this upon herself?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not just anyone, Appa,

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's Suboor!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A friend of Ashir's and Reham's!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir knows that if he proves that it was all Adan's fault,

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd not only accept Ashir and Reham, but forgive Suboor as well!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me,

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all a trick -- A grand plot to --

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough, Dad!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you ever tired of lying?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Farah?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything Suboor said is true, Aunt.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's lying.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't believe her. She's saying it out of her love for Ashir!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We knew everything Suboor told you already.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir and Reham haven't wronged you.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For greed... For our gain!

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one else...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We plotted against you.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've wronged you, Aunt.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hid this from you to get Ashir.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Mum and Dad!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and Dad led you astray for their greed!

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They haven't given up!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All they want is your money!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've used all of us!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Daughter...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sister...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia, please...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me one chance --
-Get out of my sights!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So many chances... I'd given you so many chances, Taufiq...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thinking that you've changed...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I was wrong.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Betrayal runs in your blood.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can never wish for anyone's good.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can fall to any low for your gain.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I kept on trusting you!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No longer.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me put it the way you deserve.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't expect me to honour our relation

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you never cared to.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've forgotten

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I ever had a brother.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't show yourself ever again!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't you dare so much as touch anyone from my family!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or I'll give you a reply in your language.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia...
-Get out!

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was very hard for me to believe that you'd left me in that situation...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyday, I hoped,

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That even as the world stood against me,

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would be by my side,

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd speak for me,

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I lost hope everyday...
-You weren't wrong to hope, Reham.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was wrong.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I should've done.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I wanted to do.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I couldn't.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad sent me to America right away.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought Fesl would help me when I'm there.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd talk to Ashir...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that never happened.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think I'm excusing myself by telling you all of this.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've broken your trust.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and Ashir have had to go through a lot because of me.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think any of it matters anymore, Suboor...

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The worst has already happened.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Reham...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can never recompense what you've gone through,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've made sure

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you don't have to suffer any more.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before I came here,

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to Ashir's.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've confessed my crimes

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before Aunt Sofia.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I destroyed everything...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to tell you...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tried to tell you about what's going on.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But grief, it seems, had blinded you...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Appa...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't blame grief and vindicate myself.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham's suffering...

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything she's gone through...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have to pay for it all.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Ashir...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I did to Ashir...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How would I ever make up for that?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I doubted the one

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who loved me more than himself...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't face him...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How would I?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say that, Sofia...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll only make it more difficult for you to rebuild.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know Reham very well.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never saw an ounce of hatred in her for you.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything she went through...

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She did with the hope that you'd accept her when you'd find out the truth.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Ashir...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know Ashir's love better than me.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This place has been drained of all happiness...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, let them come back.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's she here when it's all over?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A truth spoken too late is no good.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She regrets what she's done.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want her regret.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It means nothing!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ashir.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you wanted -

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That my innocence be proven before Aunt. And it has been.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Aunt would have no complaints now.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I do, Reham.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of her, and if you can't see it etched all over my face, of you too.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think it's easy for me to be away from her?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I miss her every single moment!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The part of me that wants to obey her battles the part of me that wants to go back every day.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not going back until she calls me back.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you see who it is?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's only one thing about you that's very bad.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You obey everything I say.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just refused sometime...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fought with me...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Complain...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be angry...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, how would I learn to make it up to you, Ashir?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have called me an outsider.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't have.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor asked me to leave the house.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't have.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've hurt me so much...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me it won't happen again.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It won't. I promise.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll never forgive you if you did...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But forgive me this time.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!
-Please...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've missed you...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't do something I wouldn't like.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be very difficult to make up to me.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so sorry...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan! Where are you?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not here...

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you hiding?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you're not cheating!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The guard's blindfolded. Can't see us here!

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can even tickle each other and she won't find out!
-No tickle...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's everyone? Adan!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shh!
-Shh!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go in?

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very bad.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at her.
-He wanted to come here!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm tired...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're hiding somewhere. I know you left me here.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan! Where are you?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you all?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over there.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They tricked you again.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not fair, Ashir!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, she's calling us.
-But wait...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!
-No, over there. See?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He came to me. I promise I didn't take him.
-Come here...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here, little one!

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were playing with rocks? So big!

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you left me here!

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With a blindfold! Want to see how it feels?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to give me a big hug?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you, little one.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
