1
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,416
Hello!

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,984
Yes, Appa Bi?

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,314
Is everything alright?

4
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:29,885
Ah, mate, it isn't alright!

5
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:32,915
His Royal Highness has locked himself in his room,

6
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:37,569
And I'm afraid breakfast may be soured if Sofia got up.

7
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:39,780
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,880
Fair enough, ask him. He only listens to you.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,517
My love is no good. It isn't even held in any regard!

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,570
I'll talk to him right away.
-Alright, bye.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,286
I knew it!

12
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,056
Appa Bi would complain to you about me.

13
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,106
Complain?

14
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,337
Complain about what?

15
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,768
She's worried for you.

16
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:16,468
Nobody around here worries for me.

17
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,370
Otherwise, they'd have understood what worries me.

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,530
Tell me, what worries you?

19
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:21,626
Oh...

20
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:23,370
Oh... Yeah, I got it.

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,717
The Hunza trip!

22
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,856
Exactly.

23
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:27,490
You'd promised.

24
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,186
But why'd you bother?

25
00:01:29,186 --> 00:01:30,490
You're going to Australia,

26
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,540
Leaving me to rot here.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,130
I'm not going to Australia on holiday, ol' chap.

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to manage the business over there.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,342
Honestly, I don't really want to go to Australia either, but I didn't turn Mum down.

30
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:41,372
Why?

31
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:43,513
Why don't you want to go?

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,780
A story for another day...

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,690
Fix your mood for now.

34
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,414
You'll get your permission for the Hunza trip today.

35
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:51,237
Sure?

36
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,446
100%.

37
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,310
Alright, see you at breakfast, okay?

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,861
Okay, deal!

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,731
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

40
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:02,943
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,981
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

42
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:10,400
<i>Come to me, beautiful one</i>

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,400
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,720
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,690
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

46
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,120
<i>Come to me, beautiful one</i>

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,100
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

48
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,690
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

49
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,396
Taufiq, I've refused many times before.

50
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,646
I won't agree if you kept on asking me.

51
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:18,976
Whatever is 1 million to you?

52
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,930
Look, Taufiq, it isn't about the money.

53
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,240
I'd lent you some just a few days ago.

54
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,416
What about that?

55
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,726
Oh...

56
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,026
So you'd have me account for those...

57
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:30,186
No.

58
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:34,270
But I'd like to know what you need this money for.

59
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,111
I'd like to start my own business.

60
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:39,010
It's just a small investment,

61
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,958
The profit will be far greater.

62
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:45,989
As for what I'd borrowed before, if you really want a full account of it...

63
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,390
It's obvious. Mum used to live with me.

64
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,280
Her medicines and treatment, her illness,

65
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,570
Her plight...

66
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,736
I had to bear everything.

67
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:58,186
If you had to bothe --
-Mum was never a bother for me.

68
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:01,686
She would've been living with me had she not been so adamant.

69
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,840
I think you misunderstood me, I didn't mean it that way.

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,976
Whatever.

71
00:04:05,976 --> 00:04:07,597
I can't give you the money.

72
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,077
Goodbye.

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,616
Halva poori!

74
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:22,390
Dad,

75
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,266
How did you know I felt like having halva poori today?

76
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,110
Because you do at least twice a week.

77
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,676
Besides, he's used to misspending his money.

78
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:34,207
Go and get some tea.
-Oh, Shakira!

79
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,536
This isn't misspending,

80
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:38,647
Shakira Begum!

81
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,616
It's

82
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:44,466
It's the most charitable use of my earnings.

83
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:45,686
Fair enough!

84
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,176
For the first time, I'm hearing that one's giving food in charity to one's child.

85
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,310
Mum,

86
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,516
If parents provide their children with food out of love,

87
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,016
It is recompensed.

88
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,370
People now have changed the meaning of 'charity' completely!
-Ah, yes.

89
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,696
Team up, dad and daughter.

90
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,900
I'm the one who's wrong.

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm the one who's wrong.
-Speaking of wrong,

92
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,719
Where's your royal duke?

93
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,100
Won't he have breakfast?

94
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,046
He's sleeping. He came back late last night.

95
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:13,187
Change his habits, Shakira.

96
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,897
Otherwise, you'll regret it later.

97
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,037
God forbid

98
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,750
That I have to regret.

99
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,826
He'll be alright once he takes up some responsibility.

100
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,516
Dad.

101
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,471
May I go to Suboor's tonight?

102
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,251
Why? Is everything alright?

103
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:34,211
Fesl will be leaving for the US.

104
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:36,850
And Suboor will be gone very soon, too...

105
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,330
She's hosting a grand soirée at her place.

106
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,846
She's invited all her friends.

107
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,616
I --

108
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:45,286
I -- tried to excuse myself --

109
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:48,066
I -- tried to excuse myself -- but she didn't listen...

110
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:51,631
Why did you have to excuse yourself, my dear?

111
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,406
Why, surely, if you ask me, you may go.

112
00:05:54,406 --> 00:05:55,540
Splendid.

113
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,550
You're just emboldening her.

114
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,320
Look,

115
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,986
It'd be proper if you kept your friendship to the University.

116
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,112
Mum...

117
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:08,002
I'm not going if you don't allow me.

118
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:10,980
When I've allowed her, it ends there.

119
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,826
You may go.

120
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,717
Thank you, Dad!

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,110
Shakira,

122
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,546
I have confidence in my daughter

123
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:28,877
Because she's earned that confidence,

124
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,950
And, God willing, she'd never let me down.

125
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:36,006
She's my pride. My pride.

126
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,200
Who's going with you on this trip?

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,666
Talha, Sami, Moiz, Kashif...

128
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,887
They're all going.

129
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,487
Adan,

130
00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:55,120
I don't like any of your friends except Talha.

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,980
Please, Mum, they're my friends.

132
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,960
Besides, what do you know them?

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,110
Well, that's the problem. Whatever <i>do</i> I know them?

134
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,950
Alright, Mum, if you've given him permission,

135
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,260
Please let him go.

136
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,680
Just let him go like that?

137
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,516
His exams are round the corner.

138
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:10,708
And as usual, you wouldn't have prepared.

139
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:14,000
He'll prepare when he gets back. Get good grades.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,188
Consider it my last favour.

141
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,121
You'd better not do a favour on him!

142
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,481
Why not?

143
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,891
He's my only brother.

144
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:23,392
And he's so cute...

145
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,346
Okay.

146
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,256
But you have to assure me about your grades.

147
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:33,077
Thank you so much, Mum.

148
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:35,060
Hello? A bit of thanking is due here, too.

149
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,706
Hello? A bit of thanking is due here, too.
-Thank you so much, bro!

150
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,990
You'll get good grades, won't you?

151
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,859
It's a tad difficult...

152
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:42,966
Got what you wanted, eh?

153
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:44,557
Would you look at that, Appa!

154
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:48,326
He's gotten Ashir to help him have his way again.

155
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,330
Let him have his way.

156
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,490
He'd be the one who'd miss Ashir the most when he's gone.

157
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,270
Innit? I was saying just that.

158
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,836
Why are you letting him go?

159
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:57,867
What do you say, bro?

160
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,588
What do you say, bro?
-Adan!

161
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,171
He's kidding, Mum.

162
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,196
It's better if this isn't even joked about.

163
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,407
Be there on time. Don't be late.

164
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,800
I won't be able to, Suboor.

165
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,937
It's very difficult.

166
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:19,127
And it's very easy for me to murder you if you didn't come.

167
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,850
Suboor?

168
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,080
Alright, here's the best motivation for you to come.

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Ashir's coming.

170
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,926
So?

171
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,146
As in,

172
00:08:31,146 --> 00:08:33,016
What do I care if he's coming?

173
00:08:33,016 --> 00:08:34,456
Really?

174
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:36,216
Is it so?

175
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:37,090
Yes.

176
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,650
I mean, what's it to me if he comes or not?

177
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,580
One shouldn't lie to one's best friend,

178
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,496
At least not so sincerely.

179
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:46,497
There, now.

180
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:47,727
Put a sock in it.

181
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,667
I've got so much to do. How'd I come if I'm not done with everything?

182
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:51,761
There!

183
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:54,007
You refused to come just a few moments ago.

184
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:57,937
The moment you heard Ashir's name --
-I was just playing around with you!

185
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,448
Please, leave it be.

186
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:00,747
Okay, bye.

187
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:01,948
Bye.

188
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,430
If you kept looking at the table for five more minutes,

189
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,659
I'd feel as if my face looks worse.

190
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,256
No, it's just --

191
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,991
Well...

192
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,552
Thank goodness.

193
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:44,374
I was beginning to get jealous of the table.

194
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,616
Where are Suboor and Fesl?

195
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:50,612
Shopping for the wedding; it'll take a while...

196
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,736
Shall we order something?

197
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:57,867
No, let's just wait for them.

198
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:00,996
What if they didn't come?

199
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,178
Yes?

200
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,366
Just kidding.

201
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,390
A great man once said that everything is fair in love and hunger.

202
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,936
Love and war...

203
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,680
Thank goodness you didn't wait for Suboor and Fesl to correct the proverb.

204
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,550
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

205
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,016
<i>Come to me, beautiful one</i>

206
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,967
<i>Come to me, my dear</i>

207
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:35,987
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

208
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:39,065
What is it that sisters don't do for their brothers?

209
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,695
And then, there's your sister.

210
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,743
She said so much to you

211
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:46,213
Over such a trifling amount of money!

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,750
One'd have to listen to it all

213
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,320
If one's going to get the money.

214
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,016
As if she's given you any money!

215
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,726
She would.

216
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,547
She always does.

217
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,577
It'll take a while.

218
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:08,298
I say you look for a permanent and stable solution.

219
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:09,150
What's this?

220
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,170
Begging before her every other month?

221
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,118
Why don't you get a job over there?
-Oh...

222
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,380
I'd do a job!

223
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm not the type to do a job.

224
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,606
I just can't do that.

225
00:11:23,606 --> 00:11:29,266
Although you're right in saying that a permanent and stable solution needs to be found out.

226
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,496
Where's Farah?

227
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,466
Where'd she be?

228
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:34,687
She's sleeping.

229
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,490
She's a proper Empress, your daughter.

230
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,230
Sleeping all day!

231
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,486
I have to do everything on my own.

232
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,580
A permanent and stable solution...

233
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,107
Mum! Get me breakfast.

234
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,596
Mum!

235
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,180
Who has breakfast at noon?

236
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,586
Your Dad's about to get back.

237
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,890
You'd rather just have lunch with him.

238
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,810
It's better if I'm hungry, then.

239
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,111
He won't let me have lunch.

240
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,660
I'd also have to take his jibes.

241
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,830
He's right, isn't he?

242
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,652
How long will he take care of everything on his own?

243
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,850
You've grown up now. Help him.

244
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,880
Mum,

245
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,020
Leave it be.

246
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,787
You're scolding him all the time.

247
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,020
He's studying right now.

248
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,662
Why won't he help Dad

249
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,422
Once he's done with his studies?

250
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,313
Yes...

251
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,702
Here's your bread and egg.

252
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:40,363
Such affection for your brother.
-Because why not!

253
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:41,662
He's my brother.

254
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:42,913
Ruined my hairdo.

255
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,563
Always the hunk, eh?

256
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,404
And my sweet Mum,

257
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:48,294
Don't say anything to him.

258
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,475
Stop worrying.

259
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,456
I'll help Dad

260
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:54,455
While he completes his studies.

261
00:12:54,455 --> 00:12:56,206
I've even started looking for a job.

262
00:12:56,206 --> 00:13:00,306
Stop worrying about us, and start worrying about going to your home [= marriage].

263
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:04,073
Forget this job and all. Who knows what you're up to!

264
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,606
Mum --

265
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,390
Ahmed...

266
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,580
Would you drop me to Suboor's at night?

267
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,206
Oh!

268
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:20,836
So that's the price for this bread and egg.

269
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,337
I'm not taking you there.

270
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,158
Your friend's got quite the mansion.

271
00:13:24,158 --> 00:13:26,529
Everyone would be coming in expensive cars,

272
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,328
And we'd ride this banger of a bike.

273
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,848
Don't you feel embarrassed?

274
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:31,657
Embarrassed over what?

275
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,517
I'm happy and satisfied with what the Lord has given us.

276
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,848
Remain happy and satisfied, then,

277
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,407
And go with Dad.

278
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:39,468
I have no interest in making a laughing stock of myself.

279
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,856
Didn't I say

280
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,807
There's no chance I'm taking you there.

281
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,820
No chance?

282
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,252
Exactly.

283
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,991
Mum, you'd have to cook breakfast for Ahmed.

284
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,796
Going on a date?

285
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,147
Excuse me?

286
00:14:34,147 --> 00:14:35,500
No, it's just

287
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,100
That you're extra sharp-dressed today.

288
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,316
That's why I said it.

289
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:43,924
One doesn't ask such questions of one's elder brother.

290
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,350
Don't get away with this reason of me being younger.

291
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,536
Besides, it'd benefit you if you told me.

292
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,720
I can help you.

293
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,590
Help me with what?

294
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,500
Impressing my sister-in-law.

295
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,092
I can give you a few tips.

296
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,482
Mum's right.

297
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,620
You're getting out of hand.

298
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,260
For now, I'd just want to get out of your hand. Let go! It hurts!

299
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,377
Check yourself, or I'd have to be stern with you.

300
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,741
You can't be stern with me.

301
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,640
Oh yes, wee laddie, I can.

302
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,220
You've only seen my affection.

303
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,930
I can see the affection

304
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,260
For her in your eyes...

305
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,230
Adan, you nasty little twit!

306
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,349
Adan, you nasty little twit!
-Phone -- phone!

307
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,596
Yes?

308
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:28,976
Yes, Sami?

309
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,800
Of course, I'm coming.

310
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,058
Okay.

311
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,246
Best of luck.

312
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,256
What's up with him?

313
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:52,000
Had a row with Kashif at school.

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,306
So much has happened and you didn't even tell me?

315
00:15:54,306 --> 00:15:56,636
How could we? We found out just now.

316
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:59,256
He'd quietly listened to a load of guff.

317
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,676
What'd he say?

318
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,230
No -- nothing.

319
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,946
What do you mean, 'nothing'?

320
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:13,710
Nothing...

321
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,387
We'll get even tomorrow.

322
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,817
Don't get worried over these trifles.

323
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:20,918
I'll take care of Kashif.

324
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,616
Kashif...

325
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,980
Look what we have here!

326
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,840
The entire Mummy-Daddy gang with their Mummy-Daddy leader.

327
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,432
What's the matter? Angry?

328
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,295
What'd you say to Talha?

329
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,530
Is he stumm?

330
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,636
Didn't he tell you?

331
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,460
Hello?

332
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,141
Bro, we don't want to mess with you.

333
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,751
As if you've got the guts to!

334
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,430
If you ever said anything to him,

335
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,811
I'd kill you for real.

336
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,936
Someone seems to be waiting restlessly for someone...

337
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,856
It's nothing, really, mate...

338
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:37,166
That's the limit, mate.

339
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,610
You've fallen in love but lack the courage to say it.

340
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,286
How long will you keep it sealed in your heart?

341
00:17:41,286 --> 00:17:43,070
It's about time you told Reham.

342
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,292
What are you afraid of?

343
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,026
Heartbreak.

344
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,600
If she rejected, this restless love, too,

345
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,166
Will be lost.

346
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,936
But what if she accepted?

347
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:58,927
This restlessness will gave way to eternal blissful peace.

348
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,020
There now!

349
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,890
It appears it's time for spring to blossom in the environs of your heart.

350
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:12,737
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

351
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:19,640
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

352
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,450
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

353
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,840
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

354
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,440
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

355
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,620
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

356
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,140
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r,' O Bulleya,</i>

357
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,980
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

358
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,037
Adan, you shouldn't have attacked him, mate.

359
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:52,380
Aye, we should've garlanded him.

360
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,816
Whatever.

361
00:18:53,816 --> 00:18:55,447
Besides, it's me he pesters.

362
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:57,330
Leave it be. Everyone knows it.

363
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,920
It's Adan he's after.

364
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,306
That's why he does it all.

365
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,506
All I me --
-Put a sock in it, mate.

366
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:07,137
Is Kashif so important that we discuss him like this?

367
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,597
I got furious

368
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,298
And hit him.

369
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:12,597
This is your last chance to speak your heart out.

370
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:15,000
It's been a few months since Suboor and I got married.

371
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,810
Your love story is still one-sided.

372
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,066
What do I do?

373
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:20,540
Propose to her in this gathering?

374
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,706
Not a bad idea.

375
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:23,120
She may feel compelled to accept.

376
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,350
She may feel compelled to accept.
-Stop it, mate.

377
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,000
Ashir, I'm leaving tomorrow.

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,361
Suboor will be in America in a few days too, and you won't get your chance.

379
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:34,880
Besides, you're leaving too --
-Hold it, she's coming here!

380
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,452
One should

381
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:40,060
Meet a few people rather than stand in a corner like this...

382
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,260
Some people would rather meet from afar,

383
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,080
Because their hearts are connected.

384
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,830
Come, Suboor, let's meet the guests. I'll leave you to yourselves.

385
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,811
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

386
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,293
How are you?
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

387
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,362
I'm fine.
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

388
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,620
<i>Come here, my beloved</i>

389
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,121
<i>Don't keep me waiting...</i>

390
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,980
Enjoying the party?

391
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,160
Yes.

392
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,721
Of course.

393
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,376
It's almost 10.

394
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:17,907
I ought to be worried.

395
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,976
He's not even answering his phone.

396
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:21,916
Who knows where he may be!

397
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,166
He'd said he's going to meet Talha.

398
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,330
Appa,

399
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,916
Nothing he says can be trusted.

400
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,547
I never had any such tension with Ashir, but Adan!

401
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,500
There!

402
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,661
Hear that?

403
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:44,131
He's come on a bike again.

404
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:47,142
How many times have I told him off!

405
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,687
Adan!

406
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,166
Don't go out after 9,

407
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,446
Don't ride a bike,

408
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,257
You don't like many of my friends.

409
00:21:04,257 --> 00:21:07,626
Mum, please don't waste your energy to tell me any of this.

410
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,256
My dear --
-Please, Appa Bi.

411
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:10,747
My mood's off.

412
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,617
I can't listen to another lecture.

413
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:13,957
Adan!

414
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,416
Did you see that?

415
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,520
Did you see how he misbehaved with you?

416
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,110
I won't spare him!
-Sofia!

417
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,916
Talk calmly in the morning.

418
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,220
I won't get any calm until the morning.

419
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,550
How daft can you be?

420
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:40,886
I'd served you a chance to talk nicely on a plate.

421
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:42,930
I trie --
-Leave it be.

422
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,670
Here's an idea: Click a picture of Reham, and take it to Australia.

423
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,670
Make do with the picture all your life.

424
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,180
Meanwhile, she'd have become someone else's here.

425
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,077
Gorblimey, mate, she likes you, but she's a woman!

426
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:56,057
She can't be the first one to say it.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,110
Here's a tip. Come with me.

428
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,880
Fesl!
-Just come with me.

429
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,186
I say, stay a while longer.

430
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:05,176
It's Sunday; the driver hasn't come, but I'll drop you home myself.

431
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:06,580
It's very late.

432
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,930
And I don't even know how I'd get back.
-There! That's sorted out.

433
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,711
You'd drop Reham home, wouldn't you, Ashir?

434
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,685
It's Sunday, the driver isn't here,

435
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:16,576
And I can't leave the guests.

436
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,250
No problem, I'll do it.

437
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,716
You'd drop her, won't you?

438
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,360
Yes.

439
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,676
I will.

440
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,426
Shall we?

441
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:26,426
Yes.

442
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,750
Alright, then.

443
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,241
If you dropped her today,

444
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,030
You won't get to pick her up ever again.

445
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,851
C'mon, old chap!

446
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,590
Why have you stopped the car?

447
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,170
Because I want to capture this moment,

448
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:03,120
And ask you whether I could have your hand for the journey beyond it.

449
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,040
Please, give me my answer.

450
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,390
I would've answered it if I had the right to.

451
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,600
But I've given this right to my parents.

452
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,160
I know,

453
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,450
And I won't disregard their right.

454
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,280
I just want to know

455
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,070
What you think about it.

456
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,590
Didn't I say

457
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,356
That I've given this right to my parents?

458
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,410
And if they decided in my favour?

459
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,750
In that case,

460
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,106
I'd accept this decision from the core of my heart.

461
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,760
It's so late.

462
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,020
We haven't the foggiest where this girl is!

463
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,900
She'd called when she'd started from Suboor's place.

464
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,660
She'd be here any moment.

465
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,620
It's been too long since.

466
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,340
I say you

467
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,442
Call her again.

468
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,627
Looks like she's nearby, so she's not answering the phone.

469
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,976
So,

470
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:59,686
When do I bring Mum to meet Aunt and Uncle?

471
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,241
I'd need some time.

472
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,626
I'd talk to Mum first.

473
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,730
I'd be waiting.

474
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,000
You can drop me here. I'll walk the rest of the way.

475
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,366
Why?

476
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,990
Because I don't want that anybody should see you

477
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,840
And say anything about my parents' honour.

478
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,760
And my conscience does not allow me to drop you all alone and leave.

479
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,020
Don't worry,

480
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,720
Their honour is dear to me, too.

481
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,700
Take a left here.

482
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,356
D -- Dad, he's --

483
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:41,056
A friend of Fesl's, Ashir.

484
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:43,678
Good evening.
-Good evening.

485
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:46,448
How are you? Everything good?
-Yes.

486
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:50,450
Suboor's driver was on leave, and she couldn't come to drop her,

487
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,526
So she sent me to drop Reham.

488
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,796
Oh.

489
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,330
Thank you very much, my dear.

490
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,090
Why don't you come in and have a cup of tea?

491
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,430
Another time. I'll come with my Mum.

492
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,366
You're welcome here.

493
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,477
Good night, Uncle.

494
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:05,148
Good night.

495
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,280
I'm honest, mate.

496
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,652
I said it all.

497
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:24,050
So, did she accept?

498
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,560
What did she say?

499
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,090
She's half-accepted it.

500
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,910
She'd half-accepted it long ago.

501
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,282
There was always your one-sided love.

502
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:35,050
I'll be going over with Mum to formally propose to her.

503
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,781
She has no objections to that.

504
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,311
Then, she's fully accepted.

505
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,322
Whatever's left?

506
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,290
Her parents' acceptance.

507
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,026
Why would they refuse?

508
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,907
Our lad's a real gem.

509
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,687
When are you going?

510
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,958
She'd talk to her Mum and tell me.

511
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,550
We'll see then.

512
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,850
Alright, thank me.

513
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,010
Thanks for what?

514
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,020
Seriously?

515
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,650
If I didn't force you, you wouldn't have said a word for the next 40 years.

516
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,986
You'd have departed from this world, taking your quiet love along.

517
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,316
Okay,

518
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:05,580
Okay, thank you.

519
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,306
You're welcome. And best of luck.

520
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:08,506
And yes,

521
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,817
Keep me posted, okay?

522
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:13,439
Sure.

523
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:14,732
Bye.

524
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:28,176
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

525
00:28:28,176 --> 00:28:34,957
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

526
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:41,930
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

527
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,267
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

528
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,880
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

529
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

530
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,580
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

531
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,180
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

532
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:03,650
The girl comes home from her friend's with an unknown man, in <i>his</i> car,

533
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,326
And you're not worried at all?

534
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:09,610
Don't paint such a negative picture, Shakira.

535
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:14,536
Suboor had sent her with him, and Suboor knows what it's like

536
00:29:14,536 --> 00:29:16,420
In our family.

537
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,590
She would obviously have sent someone she trusted.

538
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,250
Do you have the foggiest

539
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,770
What could've happened if a neighbour,

540
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,876
Someone from the family,

541
00:29:23,876 --> 00:29:25,730
Any friend or relative had seen them?

542
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,641
They'd just need an excuse to spread rumours.

543
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,411
I don't care about anybody's rumours.

544
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:33,390
But I do.

545
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,000
Don't you trust your daughter?

546
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,620
Don't you have confidence in how you've brought her up?
-It's about a girl.

547
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,230
One misstep

548
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,087
Can lead to a lifetime of regret.

549
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,730
It's nothing!

550
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,606
Shakira, I have full faith in my daughter.

551
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:54,127
She's educated,

552
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,746
Wise,

553
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:59,127
She knows right from wrong.

554
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,106
Alright, I have to go to the shop.

555
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,556
If the royal duke gets up,

556
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:08,407
Send him to run the shop for one hour,

557
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,097
I have to go to the market to get some goods.

558
00:30:11,097 --> 00:30:11,870
I'll get going.

559
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,232
Bye.
-Bye.

560
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,876
Ahmed!

561
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,637
Ahmed!

562
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,920
Hi.

563
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,681
Yeah, I'd called to check about my applications.

564
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,209
I'd submitted them last week.

565
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,586
Yeah.

566
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,600
Sure, I'll be waiting.

567
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,430
Thank you.

568
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,626
Bye.

569
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,621
Hello there, young lady!

570
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,186
Whom were you talking to

571
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,336
With such a wide smile?

572
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:53,446
Look,

573
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:55,247
Don't you dare hide anything from me.

574
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,446
Mum!

575
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,167
What's up with you?

576
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:02,448
I'd called where I'd applied for a job for a follow-up.

577
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,590
Oh?

578
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,826
Aren't you a tad too serious about the job?

579
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,106
Obviously.

580
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:10,580
What've I studied so much for?

581
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,990
To assist Dad.

582
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,975
To change the condition of all of us.

583
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,695
Why don't you understand?

584
00:31:17,695 --> 00:31:19,475
If your Uncle found out,

585
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:21,420
He'd make our lives living hell.

586
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,621
He's already said so much about you going to University.

587
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:26,841
Why do you bother about him so much?

588
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,191
Has he ever bothered about us?

589
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:32,691
It's because of him that we're in this condition.

590
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,010
He's taken Grandpa's land all for himself.

591
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,790
He didn't even give Dad his share.

592
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,409
He's an elder.

593
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:40,210
One has to bother.

594
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,326
Oh?

595
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,737
Then, ask him to show some maturity, too.

596
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,466
He's an 'elder' just to jeer!

597
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,600
Mum, I'd work

598
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,717
And assist Dad.

599
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,706
This girl will start a quarrel in the family.

600
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,166
This is the list of all our potential clients in Australia, Ma'am.

601
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:10,496
There's also the details of the initial orders that we have to deliver.

602
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,846
Good.

603
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,160
What about Ashir's accomodation and tickets?

604
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,150
We've bought a house near the office.

605
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,000
Tickets can be confirmed whenever you say.

606
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,786
Alright.

607
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:24,667
Please email me a soft copy of this.
-Sure.

608
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:26,417
Alright, thank you.

609
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,398
Come in.

610
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,236
Sorry, Mum, I got a bit late.

611
00:33:05,236 --> 00:33:07,927
It's perfectly alright. Come and sit.

612
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,470
Ashir, you didn't ask me why I wanted to start our business in Australia,

613
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,106
Nor why I want to send you, of all the people, there.

614
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,110
You've decided it for me, Mum.

615
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,990
That's enough for me.

616
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,321
No.

617
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,032
It's important that you know.

618
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:38,883
Pray tell, then.

619
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,850
It was your Dad's dream.

620
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,860
He wanted that we

621
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,262
Compete in the international market.

622
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,402
And who could be better than you

623
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:57,283
To make this dream a reality?

624
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,786
I'd try my best, Mum --

625
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:03,948
Don't 'try'.

626
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:06,490
You have to make it happen.

627
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:11,226
You have to focus all your attention on this project.

628
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:14,621
And I know you won't let me down.

629
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,287
Yes, Mum.

630
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,076
Haroon has all the details,

631
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:21,120
You should meet him.

632
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,456
Okay.

633
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,052
Do you want to say anything, Ashir?

634
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,706
No.

635
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:39,627
Nothing.

636
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,527
Are you sure?

637
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,450
Yes.

638
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,500
Who's there?

639
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:19,297
It's me. Munir.

640
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,710
Munir...

641
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,090
Nobody's at home.

642
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:30,076
Dad's gone to the shop,

643
00:35:30,076 --> 00:35:31,566
And Ahmed's outside too.

644
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:33,386
So is Mum.

645
00:35:33,386 --> 00:35:35,656
Jeez, I'm your Uncle's son,

646
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:38,276
Not an outsider. Open the door.

647
00:35:38,276 --> 00:35:41,360
No -- I can't open the gate.

648
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,520
Mum's told me not to open the gate

649
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,160
For anyone before she comes back.

650
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,416
I've brought this faluda [cold dessert] for you. You love it, don't you?

651
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:51,726
No, Munir...

652
00:35:51,726 --> 00:35:55,146
I've got a sore throat...

653
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,900
Sore throat...

654
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,337
What happened? Should I take you to the doctor?

655
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,196
Reham!

656
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,696
Reham!

657
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:11,380
Reham!

658
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,110
'Faluda'!

659
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,646
Hello, bro.

660
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:52,266
Hello.

661
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,566
What's the matter?

662
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,017
Aren't you packing for the trip?

663
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,710
The trip's cancelled.

664
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,166
Cancelled? Why?

665
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,293
Landslide.

666
00:37:04,293 --> 00:37:05,950
All the roads are blocked.

667
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,210
Oh...

668
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,746
That's wasted...

669
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:10,040
Well, fair enough, though.

670
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,986
Saves me the money.

671
00:37:12,236 --> 00:37:13,320
Money?

672
00:37:13,446 --> 00:37:16,540
Yeah, you were going on the trip, so I thought I'd give you some money.

673
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,201
But now...

674
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:20,411
No -- I'll keep this.

675
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:23,446
The thing is, I'm very sad now that the trip's been cancelled.

676
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:27,302
A round of shopping will fix the mood a bit.

677
00:37:27,866 --> 00:37:29,200
Alright, tell me,

678
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,230
How was your date?

679
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,891
Little twit's never going to change, eh?

680
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,786
Little twit's never going to change, eh?
-Tell me and I won't say a word.

681
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,856
There's nothing like what you're thinking.

682
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,467
Oh?

683
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,807
That means it's much more dangerous.

684
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:46,450
You ought to do something of the sort real quick,

685
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,246
Before you're past the age!

686
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:50,896
You ought to think about your age before saying these big words.

687
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:52,220
Of course...

688
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,570
How about a game?

689
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,407
Why not? C'mon.

690
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,407
Barkat,

691
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:04,380
I've come here myself, putting everything behind us.

692
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,159
Yes...

693
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,536
Although it's not really something that ought to be put behind...

694
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:13,110
Now, if you

695
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,110
Don't mind my saying so,

696
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:20,010
Sending Reham to University was not such a big affair

697
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,030
That one would be so cross as to sever all ties.

698
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,310
Very good, Dad!

699
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,056
You sent the girl

700
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:32,346
To study with boys, and you think it's nothing to be angry over?

701
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:33,560
Please,

702
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,710
Leave it be.

703
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,386
It was a mistake.

704
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,090
Blimey, Mum...

705
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,420
Aye, it is a mistake.

706
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,367
But we're the elders.

707
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,757
We'd have to show some kindness and forgive you.

708
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,598
Parveen, let's get to what we'd come here for.

709
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:48,798
Yes, Barkat.

710
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:50,520
It's a very old one

711
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,626
If you remember.

712
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,150
Come to ask for something again.

713
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,570
What is it?

714
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,410
Reham and Munir were betrothed in their childhood.

715
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,881
Do you remember at all?

716
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,400
It's about time the two of them got married.

717
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
