1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arshad!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That gunshot --

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It came from inside.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My little Adan!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyone!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear Adan...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My sweet Adan...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear Adan...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open your eyes!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan --

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't have done this!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone save my little one!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The child has committed suicide, but we've not been able to get any more details.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned down in love, a child from Karachi has committed suicide.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're trying to, but are not being allowed in. We'll update you as we get more information.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's possible the boy was alone. We haven't been able to talk to anyone from his family yet.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We bring you a really tragic news. A 16-year-old student from Karachi, unsuccessful in love,

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shot himself dead.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're reporting from Karachi. A 16-year-old student,

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Having failed in love, shot himself dead.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We repeat, a 16-year-old student, smitten with his teacher, has committed suicide.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't show you some parts of this video which is viral on social media,

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we'll show you what this child said in his parting message.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Top yourself'.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you'd said, innit?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll top myself.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And for my love.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
... has shot himself dead.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read it over a few times. As many times as you can.
-We can't show you some parts of this video which is viral on social media,

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm quite confident, given what we've just talked about,
-But we'll show you what this child said in his parting message.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That they'd sign it tomorrow.
-What are you punishing me for?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I fell in love with you?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of respect for our relationship, I'd not mention your name,

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...
-Out of respect for our relationship, I'd not mention your name,

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of respect for our relationship, I'd not mention your name,

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd prove to the world that I love you.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That is cheap,

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a load of guff just because you're older than me.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rubbish!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe in any of it.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Top yourself'.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you'd said, innit?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll top myself.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you,

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And for my love.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly, now, I'm late!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd told her, 'Appa',

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Keep the young lad in check! He's hot-blooded'!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He may do something one day'.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord! What has happened?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It would've been the end of the world for her.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She only had one son.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on to yourself.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, get a grip on yourself. You've got to comfort her!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't Appa know something like this has happened?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Bari Appa called to tell me.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Farah?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Farah! Quickly now, mun!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got to get there before Appa!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on already, Farah!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell Ashir?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I don't have the number he's using in Australia. I'll get it when we get there.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on.
-Quickly.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're standing where the 16-year-old had committed suicide...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, we turn to a family where the child has committed suicide reportedly out of love for his teacher. We're here to find out the truth behind this story.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was his mother aware of it or not?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're waiting -- And his mother's here.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am, please tell us, we're reporting this.
-Please, tell us.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Were you aware that your son loved a woman?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know her name?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am! Please!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did your son do drugs?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know who --
-Please, step aside.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn the camera. Ma'am! Ma'am!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Ma'am!
-Quiet, please!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Appa!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan -- I saw Adan on TV...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's alright, isn't he?
-No -- yes...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's alright.
-Then --

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you crying?
-I'm not crying -- not -- inside --

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go inside.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why -- why not? Alright, why are you crying?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why -- why not? Alright, why are you crying? Please, stop crying.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why -- why not? Alright, why are you crying? Please, stop crying.
-I'm not crying!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crying --

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not crying...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia --

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go inside, Sofia...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Sofia --

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia! For Heaven's sake -- don't go inside!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My Lord...</i>

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan, get up, my dear.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, Adan...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm something of a sweet little lad, innit, Mum?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Something of a'!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan --

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia, get up!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, Sofia!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call the doctor!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The doctor...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Life has come to a halt; time is vexed</i>

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Each moment seemingly centurial</i>

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The reverie of love rewarded me with damnation</i>

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Even my home stings at me</i>

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Miasmic and etiolated, loathy is this garth</i>

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd come to in a while.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But seeing her current situation...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd have to watch her closely.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, I'll leave you outside.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me Ashir's number from Appa Bi so that I can call him.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll be back.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir, please do something about the media fellows. It's a blooming crowd outside asking all sorts of questions.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now, we don't want to meet or talk to anyone.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw them all out.
-Alright, sir.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are the police here?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could come at such a moment but the police...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir, this phone...

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it unlocked.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir,

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although the video says everything about the reason for his death,

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Protocol requires

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A post-mortem examination of the body.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have someone come along when we take the body.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd go along myself.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Razzaq!
-Yes, sir?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the body for a post-mortem.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you punishing me for?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was my sin?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I fell in love with you?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Top yourself'.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you'd said, innit?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll top myself.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you,

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And for my love.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan --

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's about to kill himself...

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No -- No, my dear...
-Appa -- he's in his room --

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No --
-No, Appa -- Let me go...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No -- It's nothing --
-No, Appa, he's in his room...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd shoot himself -- let me go!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, let me go to him!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please let me go...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd kill himself...

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please let me go...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd kill himself...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's left us forever, Appa...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's never coming back...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be brave, Appa...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's gone...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My Lord...</i>

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Ashir, Uncle.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is everything alright? You and Farah had called many times.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not alright, my dear...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Book a ticket and get back to Pakistan as soon as you can.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is everyone alright?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's Mum?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, she's fine...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Appa Bi alright?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's alright, too, mate...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
W --

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Adan?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Adan? Is he alright?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Adan?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan --

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's gone -- Adan...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan's left us forever... He's' gone...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashir?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For Heaven's sake, Ashir, get a grip on yourself and get back to Pakistan.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O Lord!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless my daughter with happiness.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The next chapter of her life begins tomorrow.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O God, make her path

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bed of roses.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let there be no thorns in her way.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give her eternal bliss, O Lord...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've done what you wanted to.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Top yourself'.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you'd said, innit?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll top myself.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you,

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And for my love.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell us something.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was she?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's her story?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what do his family say?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't have much information right now.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, that's not a lot like you, sir.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would've gotten something.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We haven't talked to the family yet.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if there's any good story,

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, do get back to me.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going for now,

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This phone's been unlocked.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may go.

251
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,000
Sunday is so boring...
-Back to your studies...
-Miss you soooo much.

252
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,200
Happy Birthday!
-Thank you, Adan.

253
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Did you like my gift? Please reply. Call me. Please answer my call. Please call. Call me.

254
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:44,938
-I can't answer the phone. Text me.
-Please believe my love... Please, don't go forth with this marriage, Reham.
-Be done with this guff, Adan!
-Why don't you believe me, why don't you believe that I've fallen in love with you?
-I don't care about your love. Forget me.
-Please don't do this... It kills me...
-Go top yourself!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning, officer!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd have something for me.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's quite the news, officer.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tomorrow's newspaper will be a bestseller.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, officer!

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying, Uncle, but I can't get a flight before the day after tomorrow.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of Mum.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left all alone...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He could've taken me along...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What --

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I do without him?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd I live for?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His was the only voice that echoed around this house.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Mum',

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I want this',

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Mum',

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get me that'...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Mum'...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This silence will choke me...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd nag me and be cross with me, and whom will I sweeten up?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't he think for once

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of love

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could be greater than my love for him?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can we do, Sofia?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps that's what the Lord wan --
-No.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't what the Lord wanted.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is not what the Lord wanted.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've talked to Ashir.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The earliest flight he can get is two days later.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham, I know

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That this isn't your heart's decision;

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps you don't have any right to take the decision that your heart wants,

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because we decide with our minds,

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we're expected to uphold them.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd have to, too.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Suboor's not here yet...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be on her way.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Phone --

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talked it all out, have you?
-No...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, go on.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk all you want.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once I've taken her home,

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't be getting a chance easily.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rubina,

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell your Dad

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the bride is ready.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can bring the priest here.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praise the Lord, my daughter looks so comely.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.
-Come.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Apologies for bothering you.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to come because

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something had come up.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Raza,

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the woman who led your son to commit suicide.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's the one he loved.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or is it that

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She betrayed his love...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she be so selfish?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know anything, I need to talk to her right now.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she betray me?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are a lot of messages in this that show

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Reham didn't talk to him.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything was normal before this.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then, Adan sent her her address and threatened that he'd come home.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan went over,

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And found out

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Reham's getting married.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan kept on asking her not to get married.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Reham virtually kicked him out.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then,

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adan said in his last message

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it kills him,

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To which Reham replied with

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Go top yourself'!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want her arrested.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the name of the Lord God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham,

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham, daughter of Barkatullah,

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your marriage is proposed to Munir, son of Rehmatullah,

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With a dower of 25,000 Rupees in the current coinage. Do you accept this marriage?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham,

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham, daughter of Barkatullah,

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your marriage is proposed to Munir, son of Rehmatullah, with a dower of 25,000 Rupees in the current coinage. Do you accept this marriage?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham, daughter of Barkatullah,

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your marriage is proposed to Munir, son of Rehmatullah, with a dower of 25,000 Rupees in the current coinage. Do you accept this marriage?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praise the Lord. Bless you.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sign this.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! You know my predicament</i>

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life has become an affliction</i>

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every gasp weighs at me</i>

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why don't these doleful nights come to pass?</i>

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you!

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it? She's getting married today!
-'Mistaken' my foot!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is this?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're here to arrest Reham.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham?

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
W -- What?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reham's my daughter.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, you must be mistaken -- Why?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have a very good reason, sir!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lad she used to tutor

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Committed suicide because of her.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Codswallop!

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't codswallop!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've come here with strong evidence.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trapped him with her love,

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then enjoyed herself on his money,

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when it came to marriage,

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She betrayed him and led him to commit suicide!

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You --

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying? Everything --

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You --

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My -- It's all a lie!
-It's a lie. My daughter couldn't possibly do this!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only faces

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only faces could show intentions!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your upbringing must have had some flaw.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
N -- No...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go,

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arrest her.
-Wh -- What are you doing?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey --

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen --

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahmed, listen --
-What are you doing?

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop them!
-Stop her!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute!
-Stop!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't just arrest me like that!
-You can't just take her away!

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't just arrest me like that! Listen to me!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!
-Let go!
-By the Lord!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't take her away!
-Let go of her!
-Reham!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Inspector, she --

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord --

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I haven't done anything...

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honest!
-Shut up!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Inspector --
-Just come over to the police station!

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll confess your crime.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't done anything! Please, listen to me --

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing, Inspector?

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Halt!

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle!

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Divorce her, Munir!

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wh -- What?

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Munir...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- Dad!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you hear me?

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Divorce her!

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness, what are you saying? For God's sake -- What are you saying?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Barkatullah!

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We are honourable men!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We won't let her tainted honour

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tarnish our names!

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --
-Divorce her!

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, Dad --

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir...

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir...
-If you don't divorce her,

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to disown you!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Divorce her!
-Rehmat --

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir --

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munir -- Please...

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hereby divorce you.
-Mu --

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I divorce you.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I repeat, I --

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I repeat, I -- Divorce you.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come. We're done here.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tear me to shreds</i>

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like a modiste tears rags</i>

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has ever been able to tame the mind</i>

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one has been able to chain it</i>

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'a' of amour</i>

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dares not take up arms against fate</i>

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He who understood the 'm,' 'o,' 'u,' and 'r', O Bulleya,</i>

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Found himself reduced to a fakir.</i>

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Lord! Hear this call; why is my road engulfed in darkness</i>

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pronounce a judgement now</i>

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>From the Heavens as You see meet</i>

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>With my head bowed, I accept</i>

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I am lost in this rout of woe</i>

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do I recount what has befallen me</i>

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why is every last vestige of love immured?</i>

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
