1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been longing for this moment...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Palwasha! Get something for them. Here.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're here.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Already? Wee hee!
-Not so fast!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gonna see them, of course!
-Did you hear Aunt call you?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez... I gotta wait for her now...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you'll get to see them now that they're here.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mirha...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have no idea how happy I am, Mirha!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've waited so long for this one moment!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mirha!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and take a look! Tell me how he looks!
-No way! Aunt's eyes would shoot me dead if I went there.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mirha! I beg you! Please, Mirha! Please, please please...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it already, you drama queen!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... I'll go take a look...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... What if Aunt called you Rushna before him?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, I've told Mum everything!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you're so...!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... You're supposed to be the ideal oriental girl. So keep your head covered and eyes lowered, okay? Don't start ogling him!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arham's all yours!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, now! Get going and tell me they want to see me!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should check my lipstick.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and get some spoons and plates.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
