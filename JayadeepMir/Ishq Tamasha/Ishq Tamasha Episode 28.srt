1
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,410
Again?

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,090
Listen to one thing, Mum -

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,110
You'd reap only what you'd sow.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,169
Don't expect roses when you've planted cacti!

5
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:19,040
Give me the pills.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,323
I'm having a bad headache.

7
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:22,824
I'm having a bad headache.
-No, Madame, I can't give you those pills.

8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,480
You'd only get worse if you took those...

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,630
Give me those blimming pills, Sabira!

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,710
But remember, Mehrab,

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,620
Don't expect anything from me,

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,559
For you won't get anything except misery.

13
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,040
Good Lord...

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,781
What now...

15
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,609
Take your medicines, Madame.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,939
Madame...

17
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,911
Madame, your pills...

18
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,430
What would you like, sir?

19
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,780
One bun kebab.

20
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,911
Anything else?

21
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,301
That's all.

22
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:04,821
Cold drinks?
-No, thank you.

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,380
This place is rather famous for its bun kebabs.

24
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,849
You want to have a bun kebab?

25
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,790
I'd enjoy these with my friends after college.

26
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,840
Would you like to try?

27
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,152
What would you like to have, sir?

28
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:43,913
2 bun kebabs, with a lot of chutney!

29
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,170
I'd like...

30
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,175
The chicken and double egg one.

31
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:52,718
Anything else?

32
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,516
Drinks?

33
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,900
That will be all.

34
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,791
Here's your bun kebab, sir.

35
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,561
Why must you create a scene here everyday?

36
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,129
Why must you let me create a scene?

37
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,950
Why not just listen to me for once

38
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,270
And come with me?

39
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,670
Why should I go with you, Mehrab?

40
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,540
Who are you to me?

41
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,740
Our sorrows are shared, Mirha.

42
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,005
The least you could do is shed a few tears with me.

43
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,391
I'm very lonely...

44
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,480
Why?

45
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,920
What happened to Rushna?

46
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,290
I don't know anything about her.

47
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,370
And frankly, I don't even bother.

48
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,060
What do you mean, Mehrab?

49
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,268
Why did you marry her if you don't even bother?

50
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:38,362
Sometimes, passions push people into taking unimaginable decisions.

51
00:05:38,362 --> 00:05:41,190
One's forced to act on them...

52
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,212
I don't get it.

53
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,113
I wish I could explain it.

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,930
Perhaps...

55
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,690
Losing Arham

56
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,010
Had shattered me so much

57
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:03,440
That I decided to pluck the smile from Rushna's face.

58
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,649
Mehrab...

59
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,720
I didn't expect this from you.

60
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,721
I shouldn't have done this, bu --
-But you did.

61
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,311
How is Mehrab any different from Rushna?

62
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,650
They've both ruined lives out of love for their selves.

63
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,730
It pains me.

64
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,120
Very much.

65
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,040
Monsieur! Madame's very ill, please see her.

66
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,731
Please see her, Monsieur, she's seriously ill.

67
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Come.

68
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,860
Rushna!

69
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,219
Rushna!

70
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,623
Rushna...

71
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,110
Get up, Rushna!

72
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:04,249
Rushna?

73
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,319
Get up, Rushna!

74
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,770
What happened to her?

75
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,980
She had a bad headache.

76
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,350
Which pills have you given her?

77
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,011
The one Madame la Maîtresse used to take.
-Show me.

78
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,409
Rushna!

79
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,670
Rushna?

80
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,020
What've you been giving her?

81
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,610
Who told you it's a painkiller?

82
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,892
Sometimes, passions push people into taking unimaginable decisions.

83
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:48,118
One's forced to act on them...

84
00:08:50,198 --> 00:08:51,978
Losing Arham

85
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:55,259
Had shattered me so much

86
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,950
That I decided to pluck the smile from Rushna's face.

87
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,200
Our sorrows are shared, Mirha.

88
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,620
The least you could do is shed a few tears with me.

89
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,490
The least you could do is shed a few tears with me.
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

90
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,680
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

91
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,541
I'm very lonely...
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

92
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,690
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

93
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:28,501
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

94
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:33,821
<i>O my Moon, where've you been?</i>

95
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,281
Hello?

96
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,491
What?

97
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,221
What happened to Rushna?

98
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:51,224
Alright, don't worry, we'll be there shortly.

99
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,163
Why are you worrying? Dubai isn't <i>that</i> far away.

100
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,160
Your son will be back in a few days.

101
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,380
Quickly, Mum!

102
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,164
Rushna's seriously ill!

103
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:06,099
What's with all the noise at this hour?

104
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,530
I got a call from Rushna's. She's very sick!

105
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,710
So?

106
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,819
We should be going to see how she is, shouldn't we?

107
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,660
No need for that. Her husband's there to look after her.

108
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,709
She needs <i>us</i>, Mum!

109
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,580
I said no one's going there!

110
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,510
She's your daughter, Mum. At least don't say that for her!

111
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,510
She's your daughter, Mum. At least don't say that for her!
-She's dead for me!

112
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,920
Why should I care about anyone when no one cares about me?

113
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,722
Alright.

114
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:34,470
Don't go. But <i>I</i>'m going.

115
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,246
What are you saying, Aqila?

116
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,090
Call her even if you're not going.

117
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,120
You know very well, Khala Amman, she must be putting up an act!

118
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,170
Remember how she used to act sick to bunk off school?

119
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,900
She must acting this time around, too.

120
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,043
Why'd she do that <i>now</i>, Mum?

121
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:53,894
So I forget everything and pay her a visit!

122
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:57,450
What's wrong with that? Why not just go for her sake?

123
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,819
You always knew she was putting up an act,

124
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:03,149
But you'd have her take the day off.

125
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,040
Have some mercy, Aqila!

126
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,190
She's your daughter! Your blood!

127
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,950
She'd be fine, Khala Amman!

128
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,040
Catch some sleep and let me catch some, too!

129
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,599
She never bothered about us, but I should bother about her!

130
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,381
Goodness, Aqila...

131
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:27,132
Only the Lord can give you better sense... You don't know --
-Shut up, Khala Amman!

132
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,810
My love for Arham had driven me mad.

133
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,100
I have no right to toy with anyone's life like this.

134
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,620
Rushna did what she did

135
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,410
Unknowingly...

136
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,750
But I've done no better...

137
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,089
Rushna!

138
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,443
What'd I say to Mehrab at this hour?

139
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,130
No.

140
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,183
He'd think I'm too emotional.

141
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,650
I shouldn't call Mehrab at this hour...

142
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,170
Yes, I'd like to order a pizza.

143
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,699
Chicken tikka.

144
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,969
Cold drink... White.

145
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,789
Yes, the same.

146
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,701
How long will it take?

147
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,379
Okay.

148
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,410
What are we cooking for lunch?

149
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,640
Nothing.

150
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,270
I've ordered pizza.

151
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,460
Oh?

152
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,501
That's good.

153
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,330
Which reminds me...

154
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,590
Ice cream tastes so good with pizza!

155
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,291
I'll ask Iqbal to get some.

156
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,136
Hey!

157
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,800
What're you eating? Leave that be.

158
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,050
What are you doing?

159
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,130
I'm very hungry. Let me heat it.

160
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,840
Forget <i>that</i>!

161
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,651
Right here! Ta-da!

162
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,061
Pizza and ice cream!

163
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:48,397
You love it, don't you?

164
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,001
Are you ever afraid?

165
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:57,690
Hey!

166
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,019
It's the fear that thrills!

167
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,210
Ain't my life so movielike?

168
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,901
He lost his heart to me at first sight.

169
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,380
Don't you think a miracle's about to happen in my life?

170
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,920
Why do you keep annoying her?

171
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,213
Let her be annoyed.

172
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:20,810
I can't bear your absence

173
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,840
At such an important point of my life.

174
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,610
Alright, I'm not going anywhere. Come, let's get ready.

175
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,819
Mirha!

176
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:45,980
There's no difference between us. What's mine is yours. Show me your hand.

177
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,650
We'll get our ice cream in a while.

178
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,073
What happened?

179
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,984
Why are you crying?

180
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Tell me, will you?

181
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,870
Don't cry...

182
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,981
What is it, Mirha?

183
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:32,975
Rushna...

184
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:36,044
I'm missing Rushna...

185
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:38,533
Well, then, call her.

186
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,344
There, now. Let's call her.

187
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,700
Easy there.

188
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,771
Arham?

189
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,519
It's you...

190
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,962
Rushna, it's --

191
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,412
Not Arham. I'm Mehrab.

192
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,512
Look at me.

193
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,317
Wh --

194
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,030
What are you doing, Rushna?

195
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,667
Rushna...

196
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,240
Put it back on, you'll have trouble breathing.

197
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,540
Put it on.

198
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,263
Let me say what --

199
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:05,374
I've always wanted to...

200
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,380
I always knew --

201
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,450
You'd be here...

202
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,161
You're the only one who ever cared...

203
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,070
I've hurt you so much...

204
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,352
And look...

205
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,462
Where it got me...

206
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,249
I'm dying for a drop of love...

207
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,930
Punish me, Arham...

208
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,069
For breaking --

209
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,880
Your heart...

210
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,819
Everyone's left me...

211
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,570
I'm all alone...

212
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,849
Even Mirha...

213
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,711
Take me along...

214
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:38,050
Take me along...
<i>Promise me</i>

215
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,470
<i>Promise me</i>

216
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:53,750
<i>Promise me that you'll never leave me</i>

217
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,790
<i>My sweetheart,</i>

218
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,510
<i>Never break my trust...</i>

219
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,913
Rushna!

220
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,681
Rushna!

221
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,250
Rushna?

222
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,640
Rus --

223
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,830
Rushna!?

224
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,550
Rushna!

225
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,609
R --

226
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,559
Doctor!

227
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,439
Anyone!

228
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,586
Mirha!

229
00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:50,860
Mirha!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

230
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,660
Rushna!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

231
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,140
Jeez, mate, calm down!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

232
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:05,630
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

233
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,350
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

234
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,245
Have some tea. I've made it myself!
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

235
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:13,686
Have some tea. I've made it myself!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

236
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:14,830
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

237
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,560
I want to dream on!
-Hey! Give it back!
-Careful!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

238
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,550
Please!
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

239
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,496
You'd better not fall down on me!
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

240
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:25,380
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

241
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,610
<i>O my Moon, where've you been?</i>

242
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,916
<i>You live in my heart</i>

243
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,686
<i>You captivate my eyes</i>

244
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:42,410
<i>I am now yours, my beloved...</i>

245
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,170
No need to thank me, mate.

246
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,580
Doing such little favours has become a habit with me.

247
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,230
Who's calling at this early hour?

248
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,830
Aqila?

249
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,980
I'll go see.

250
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,557
Hello?

251
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,043
What?

252
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,511
No --

253
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,774
Mum!

254
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,050
What happened?

255
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,060
Palwasha?

256
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
Palwasha?

257
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,106
Palwasha...

258
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:52,400
What happened?
-What is it?

259
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,399
Mum -- Rushna --
-What happened to Rushna? Tell me!

260
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:57,240
What happened?

261
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,880
Rushna's gone, Mum!

262
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,091
What?

263
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,861
Rushna's gone, Mum...

264
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,311
That can't be!

265
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,876
Mum!

266
00:24:08,236 --> 00:24:10,140
Careful!

267
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,460
No...

268
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,720
No, Khala Amman, I didn't mean that she --

269
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,120
Actually -- Die!

270
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,356
No...

271
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,388
Rushna!

272
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,271
Rushna! My dear...

273
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:25,922
Aqila...

274
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,570
Rushna!

275
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,776
Mum...

276
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,966
Mum...

277
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,070
'A few days later'

278
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,010
Look at yourself, Aqila...

279
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,670
Rushna's death grieves all of us,

280
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,941
But you've got others to worry about.

281
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,586
I'd cursed that Rushna die...

282
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:26,560
Little did I know

283
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,990
That she'd actually die...

284
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,726
It was just her time to go...

285
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:34,300
Be brave...

286
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,360
I should've been the one to go...

287
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,236
But Rushna...

288
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:40,536
Khala Amman,

289
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:43,296
You, of all, should be brave.

290
00:25:43,296 --> 00:25:45,406
Instead of comforting all of them,

291
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:48,756
You're losing your courage, too...

292
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,986
No, Kulsoom, I'm fine.

293
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,397
Deep down,

294
00:25:59,397 --> 00:26:01,930
I'm very strong...

295
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,846
Wahaj was right...

296
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,740
I've --

297
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,776
Become stone-hearted.

298
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,676
I'm --

299
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,820
I'm infinitely capable

300
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,160
Of hating

301
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,700
And tormenting...

302
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,476
Infinitely...

303
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:30,670
Wahaj is right.

304
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,940
We're trying to contact Wahaj.

305
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,306
He'll be back.

306
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,342
Don't worry.

307
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,536
Kulsoom,

308
00:26:39,536 --> 00:26:42,746
Do me a favour.

309
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:48,619
Don't punish my daughter for my mistakes.

310
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:52,509
Accept her as your own.

311
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,951
I --

312
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:59,170
I don't deserve forgiveness --

313
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:05,020
But I pray you, save my daughter from my atrocious decisions!

314
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,600
Save her...

315
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,013
Aqila...

316
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,020
What are you saying?

317
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,396
I should be the one to apologise. I've hurt you so much...

318
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,996
I promise you,

319
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:27,286
I'll accept Palwasha as Ghufran's bride.

320
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:30,000
It'd be an honour.

321
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,910
May the Lord will thus...

322
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,840
Something to begin with...

323
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,590
The kids can now be happy...

324
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,856
Palwasha...

325
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,636
Forgive me...

326
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,462
Forgive me, my dear...

327
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,900
Khala Amman... Forgive me, everyone...

328
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,004
Please, Mum, No...

329
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:21,884
Mum...

330
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,481
I'm sorry...

331
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,616
Come in.

332
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,656
Here, my dear.

333
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,450
Would you see who's here, Khala Amman?

334
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,420
Mirha!

335
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,661
My sweet Mirha...

336
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:17,100
Where were you, my dear?

337
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,991
You left all of us...

338
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:25,443
We've missed you a lot...

339
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,286
Mirha...

340
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,796
I know I --

341
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:51,200
I don't deserve it, but --

342
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,130
You're too kind...

343
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,296
If you can... Forgive me...

344
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,497
Aunt...

345
00:30:59,497 --> 00:31:01,977
What are you doing?

346
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,432
You're like my mother.

347
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:10,090
I have no complaints

348
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,010
And if I ever had,

349
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,100
They are gone with Rushna.

350
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,640
Khala Amman...

351
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,180
My --

352
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,727
Wahaj was the same, but...

353
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,289
But my hatred

354
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,257
Shattered his heart...

355
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,601
And --

356
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,290
Now, he's so cross that he didn't even come here for Rushna's funeral...

357
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,940
Aunt...

358
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,666
I'm like your son.

359
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:52,256
I'll try to fill his space.

360
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,170
May you live long.

361
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,214
May you be happy.

362
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,596
May you have a good life.

363
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,816
May you always be happy and live a good life...

364
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:34,296
Hey!

365
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:37,406
Get them something to eat.

366
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,950
Drop me at the hostel.

367
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,552
So, what's next?

368
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:56,937
I

369
00:33:56,937 --> 00:33:59,846
Haven't really planned anything...

370
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,326
Okay,

371
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,057
Then...

372
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,840
I love you.

373
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
Pardon?

374
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,916
Me -- ?

375
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,786
No.

376
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
Sorry.

377
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,500
<i>You live in my heart</i>

378
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,850
<i>You captivate my eyes</i>

379
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,390
<i>I am now yours...</i>

380
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,166
<i>You live in my heart</i>

381
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,510
<i>You captivate my eyes</i>

382
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,220
<i>I am now yours...</i>

383
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>I walk down the road</i>

384
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:52,700
<i>I walk down the road to your heart,</i>

385
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,920
<i>Looking at you every now and then</i>

386
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:06,986
<i>As if there's a bond between us...</i>

387
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,150
Would you like to say something?

388
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,370
Yes.

389
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,560
Will you marry me?

390
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,246
W -- Wha -- ?

391
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,740
Just a minute.

392
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,080
<i>Promise me...</i>

393
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,576
But, Mehrab --

394
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:57,656
It's the best I can manage right now.

395
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:09,520
<i>Promise me that you'll never leave me</i>

396
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,650
<i>My sweetheart,</i>

397
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:24,361
<i>Never break my trust...</i>

398
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:35,970
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

399
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,680
<i>You live in my heart</i>

400
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,050
<i>You captivate my eyes</i>

401
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:45,940
<i>I am now yours, my beloved...</i>

402
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:18,190
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

403
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:23,460
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

404
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,830
<i>O my Moon, where have you been all night?</i>

405
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:34,131
<i>My heart has been making excuses for you</i>

406
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:37,751
<i>O my Moon, where've you been?</i>

407
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,453
<i>You live in my heart</i>

408
