1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you answer my call?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Die of shame already!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen a lowlife like you!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this guff?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't even started my guff.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meena?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not Meena. Rushna.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm Rushna!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll regret it all my life that I couldn't see through a man like you!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know you could fall so low that you had my sister abducted to get even!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's -- Your sister?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum didn't even let her in!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows where she went in the rain...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? What are you saying?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were angry with me, right?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've vented it out on me!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was her fault?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've left her a drifter!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meena --

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear --

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't have the foggiest --
-I don't care, Arham.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give my sister her life back.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mehrab had gone to drop her?
-She isn't here.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I want to know is where she is!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meena... Listen to m --

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O Lord...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep Mirha safe.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't punish her for my mistake.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's innocent.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my fault, and she's getting punished for it.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bro!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bro?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD HERE

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meena used to talk about you a lot.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, Rushna...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd never thought

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That we'd be meeting like this.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never thought that my life would turn into an endless night

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'd be out of my house like this.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe me,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd get the dignity and respect

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you deserve over here.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't talking of respect after such humiliation sound a bit strange, Arham?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It does.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But believe me, there's no plan.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None of us wanted this to happen.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps it was just destined to happen...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it with the two of you.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd rather blame destiny than accept your fault.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We do realise our fault,

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we're trying to make up for it.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your brother's done all of this to get out of his sense of guilt,

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, even if I want to,

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't wash this blemish off me.

57
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:39,727
I'm sure my brother won't let any harm come to you.

58
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:44,029
You're still backing your brother after everything that's happened?

59
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,394
No.

60
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:49,974
I'm assuring my sister that trying times are upon us,

61
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:52,614
But these, too, shall pass...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, have your breakfast.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
