ADD

2
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:44,825
Boo!

3
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,538
Jeez! You know you're ruining your own work, don't you?

4
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:49,058
So, done yet?

5
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:50,738
Ain't even close...

6
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:54,109
By the way, looking at you, no one can tell you've got an exam tomorrow.

7
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:59,541
I swear I've got an exam tomorrow! I'm stepping out after ages, gotta look no less than my best!

8
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:05,691
And if Mum saw you...
-Yeah? So? Mum's gonna kick me out or something?

9
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:10,224
Oh, sure... Kick you out and send you home.

10
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:12,334
... Which is exactly what I want!

11
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:17,907
I'm just waiting for my Prince Charming to set me free!

12
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,698
Does he have to be charming?

13
00:07:19,698 --> 00:07:21,069
Of course!

14
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,820
No way I'm settling for any less!

15
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,939
I mean, just look at how beautiful I look!

16
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,080
Do you think I deserve any but the most charming of them all?

17
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,731
You're never gonna change, are you?

18
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:38,204
Anyway... Do you like the bangles?

19
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:41,525
They're lovely... Sent with love, so quite naturally...

20
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:46,136
Ooh, love is in the air!

21
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,597
But I want everything!

22
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,338
The riches of Paradise, a palace...

23
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:55,679
And my Prince on his steed!

24
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,591
Dream all you want in your sleep, Rushna... You've got a long night ahead of you.

25
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:08,337
And what are you doing, Palwasha?

26
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:12,961
Madame Rushna's got an exam tomorrow, and I'm working on her crib sheets!

27
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:15,212
Not cricket, Rushna!

28
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:19,614
What's the big deal? Who's gonna help me if not my sister?

29
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,175
Can't you study?

30
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:25,117
As if I'm gonna work...

31
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:26,997
God forgive you...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

33
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,119
You're still here?
-Just another moment!

34
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:57,177
I hope you've prepared well.
-Of course. I'm sure I'll ace my A-Levels this time!

35
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:59,133
Tell me something I haven't heard in three years.

36
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:02,065
I'm sure I will this time! Don't worry.

37
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,656
I'm very worried.

38
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:06,379
You won't get a good match if you don't pass your A-Levels.

39
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,059
Then again, who am I arguing with?

40
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,673
Here.

41
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:16,420
What? This is barely enough to get there!

42
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:25,875
That's all I have. Your dearest Mirha took everything else. Can't even get some grains before Wahaj sends some money... We've got nothing left...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
