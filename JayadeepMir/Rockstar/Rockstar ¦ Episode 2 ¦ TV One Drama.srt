00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,670
Present day

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,251
Have some water.

18
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:08,421
You haven't had anything since yesterday.

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,882
You might die.

20
00:01:10,882 --> 00:01:12,190
And

21
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,341
We're supposed to keep you alive.

22
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,581
I won't!

23
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:18,724
Get out of my sights!

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,410
Another video of Azan Ali Khan has been leaked,

25
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,980
Which complicates matters for him.

26
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,370
Was she going to be his next victim?

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,270
Azan Ali Khan doesn't quite seem to be in his senses,

28
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,024
And it seems she's scolding him over something he did!

29
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:53,880
It's worth a thought what Azan Ali Khan was doing backstage with her right in the middle of a show.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,568
Where was his security detail?

31
00:01:56,568 --> 00:02:00,180
He must have invited her himself!

32
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,790
This video has complicated matters for him.

33
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,330
Was she going to be his next victim?

34
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,085
Azan Ali Khan doesn't quite seem to be in his senses,

35
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,780
And it seems she's scolding him over something he did!

36
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,971
It's worth a thought what Azan Ali Khan was doing...

37
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,606
What rubbish!

38
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,089
What's going on?

39
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:22,233
I won't spare her!

40
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,976
How many will you shut up?

41
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:28,959
You're into the fire before you're even out of the frying pan!

42
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,099
You are your own enemy, Azan, you'll destroy yourself!

43
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,989
Whatever.

44
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,990
It's none of your business, Mr Omar Khan.

45
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,063
Oh,

46
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,719
Oh, really?

47
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,810
'None of my business'...

48
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,643
Then,

49
00:02:54,643 --> 00:03:01,541
How say you pay back the millions owed by your flop music company yourself?

50
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,394
This lifestyle,

51
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,930
This luxury, your bills,

52
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,173
I'm sure you can afford it all, right?

53
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,815
You can't.

54
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,559
You know that.

55
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,083
So,

56
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,566
That makes it

57
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,944
My business.

58
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,540
Your life, like your music,

59
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,583
Is a big flop.

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,423
One flop album

61
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:46,220
Doesn't do anything to my music or my stardom!

62
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,174
It's just gotten into you. You're always looking for an excuse to do me down.

63
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,650
It's just your excuse!

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,110
It isn't about one album.

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,510
Just name one half-decent song you've done in the last three years.

66
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,217
Just one!

67
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:05,123
Nobody wants to work with you;

68
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:10,901
The least you could do is maintain a good image with the public!

69
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,141
But no,

70
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:17,749
One model complains against you, another sues you!

71
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,441
What...

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,706
What's going on?

73
00:04:23,706 --> 00:04:25,555
Why don't you ask him?

74
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,150
Please, ask him.

75
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,315
He's disgraced the family already.

76
00:04:30,315 --> 00:04:34,599
Omar Khan has failed to teach his son <i>anything</i>!

77
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:35,801
What happened?

78
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:41,957
Meryem, please tell him I'll fix everything with Ejaz.
-I've fired Ejaz.

79
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,097
What?

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,301
Would you look at that, Meryem!

81
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,770
What the devil is going on?

82
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,235
Who told you to?

83
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:57,326
I hired him, and I fired him.

84
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,261
He's 60% of the reason you're ruined!

85
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,122
He was good for nothing! No strategy, no PR!

86
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:10,370
No one controls my life like this!

87
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,931
Azan Ali Khan,

88
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:16,395
It'd suit you

89
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:21,474
When you're in any control of your life in the first place. Are we clear?

90
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,430
Please tell him

91
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,427
To stay away from my life.

92
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,957
Please, think over it again.

93
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:32,284
Why be so stern?

94
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:35,380
Your love got him here.

95
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,312
I hope you know that.

96
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,029
Why shouldn't I love him?

97
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,518
He's my only nephew.

98
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,670
I say, be patient.

99
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:50,513
By the way, didn't you have a meeting today?

100
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:53,327
Look at what you've gotten into.

101
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,044
I'll tell him.

102
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:59,210
Meryem, please tell him I want Ejaz back, willy-nilly.

103
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,527
That's all.

104
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,980
Ejaz?

105
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:03,717
Come.

106
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:04,916
Here.

107
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,745
Ejaz's latest exploit.

108
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:11,987
He couldn't even stop this from making the news! Whatever can he do?

109
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,847
Anyway,

110
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:18,408
I'll get his new manager. I'll handle everything myself.

111
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,426
Heavens...

112
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,241
What kind of a girl is she?

113
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,121
She must've been sent by a sworn enemy... And --

114
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:46,198
Look at how she's talking!

115
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,346
No, Meryem...

116
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,509
She didn't even know me.

117
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:57,663
There's no girl who doesn't know you.

118
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:01,351
How'd she come to your concert?

119
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:05,181
I'm positive, Meryem.

120
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,447
Absolutely positive.

121
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:10,464
She didn't know me.

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,779
Mum!

123
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,820
Your cough won't get better if you miss your pills!

124
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,950
Come with me.

125
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,785
I'm fine...

126
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,965
No you aren't. Sit with me.

127
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,532
If you missed another pill, I'll never talk to you again.

128
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,386
Good evening!
-Good evening.

129
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,568
I must say, you look so delighted!

130
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,325
How was your day?

131
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:10,900
Splendid.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,131
Splendid-est!

133
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:18,505
The salon whose Facebook page I commented on first sent me a free gift voucher.

134
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,167
I can go to them thrice a month for free makeup!

135
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:27,384
Please take me along too!
-How many times have I said I would?

136
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,944
But first, let me go.

137
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,220
Oh?

138
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,364
But how?

139
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:37,630
Simple. I liked and shared every post, and they sent me the voucher.

140
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,557
Good Lord, whatever will she do?

141
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,169
Jeez, Mum...

142
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,936
Get ready. I can hear wedding bells. Azan Ali Khan's coming!

143
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,549
Are you touched in the head?

144
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:58,240
As if that bon viveur lacks anything! At least have decent dreams.

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,420
What do <i>you</i> know? Just stay tuned...

146
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,027
I can barely tolerate you as his fan,

147
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:08,670
And you're talking about marriage? I might just have a heart attack!

148
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,430
He's a spoilt lowlife!

149
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:17,292
Even if he were the last man in the world, we'd rather you stay single than marry him!

150
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,390
What are you saying? What happened?

151
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,038
Mahira, focus on your studies.

152
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,876
Educated people are in demand.

153
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:30,393
Besides, only if you become something can we marry you off to a good man.

154
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,944
Why are you scaring me like that?

155
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:39,374
You haven't seen how he only had eyes for me...

156
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:46,017
He's never called anyone onstage before.

157
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:49,140
Everybody was saying to me, 'How lucky'!

158
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,347
As in, he accepts the proposal, so to speak!

159
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:55,923
I just want to meet him one more time.

160
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,076
Hello?

161
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,495
Yes, it's me.

162
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,738
Of course, I'm available.

163
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:15,226
Yes, I've seen the Khan Garments office.

164
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:20,056
Send me the address, I'll be there at 4.

165
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,941
Thank you.

166
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,908
Who was it?

167
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,265
Khan Garments.

168
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,880
They're offering a job.

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,644
They need a manager.

170
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,595
Wow! Best of luck!

171
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,920
Thank you so much!

172
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,781
Thank you, O Lord...

173
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:42,657
Alright, Mum, I need to be there at 4. I'll change and leave.

174
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,734
Afreen! Please, take a seat.

175
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,711
Thank you, sir.

176
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,510
I must say, sir,

177
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,280
Your office looks great.

178
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,814
Thank you.

179
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,043
So do you know why

180
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,870
I've called you here?

181
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,933
Yes, sir.

182
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,016
I know it very well.

183
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,370
Mum had a passion for weaving.

184
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,750
Has -- even now.

185
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,205
She's taught me everything. And I love it too.

186
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,850
Really?

187
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:37,305
How did she manage everything?

188
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,164
Actually,

189
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:41,510
She was really adept at it.

190
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,470
She's a real expert. She could get any kind of clothes ready for Eid or weddings.

191
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,904
And she's taught me everything.

192
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,809
Clothes?

193
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,878
Yes, sir.

194
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:02,786
I love stitching and weaving. Know it all.

195
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,701
I can do anything, really.

196
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:11,421
Alright, tell me,

197
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:14,845
Would you be able to manage my son?

198
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,410
Why not?

199
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,348
By the way, what does your son like to wear?

200
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,802
Whatzit that's in vogue today...

201
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,468
Ripped jeans,

202
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,078
Colourful shirts, and so on...

203
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,390
Honestly, if you ask me...

204
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,596
I don't quite <i>get</i> this fashion.

205
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,390
Fair enough.

206
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,279
I mean,

207
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,281
Ripped and torn clothes used to be a sign of poverty...

208
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,969
But now it's in vogue...

209
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,600
Touché. Gotta agree with that.

210
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,980
Don't worry, sir. I won't let your son dress up like that.

211
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,770
But, Afreen...

212
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,530
What's up with this fixation with dressing?

213
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,979
W -- Why, sir?

214
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:13,421
Isn't it a job related to garments?

215
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,511
Not at all.

216
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,142
So --?

217
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:22,789
You've been called here

218
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:25,928
To manage my son.

219
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,724
You must've heard of him -

220
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:32,176
Azan Ali Khan, the rockstar.

221
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,791
Hey, ma'am!

222
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,250
You barged into <i>my place</i>, broke <i>my</i> bottle...

223
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,641
You are one of those girls

224
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:44,284
Who want to meet me, cling to me, and when they don't get to,

225
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:47,275
They show their ugly true faces.

226
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,365
Impossible!

227
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,080
Why?

228
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:54,790
I think there's been a confusion, sir.

229
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,903
Isn't this Khan Garments?

230
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,637
I was offered the job of a manager.

231
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,598
Thank goodness that's clear now.

232
00:14:01,598 --> 00:14:03,613
So, tell me,

233
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:06,007
What do you say about this?

234
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:09,034
I'd thought of something else, sir.

235
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:12,790
I'm not interested in it. I can't do it.

236
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,341
Don't worry about your pay.

237
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:19,242
I'll double whatever you ask for.

238
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:22,148
Really sorry, sir.

239
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,145
But I can't do it.

240
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:27,604
I have no interest

241
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:30,082
Or experience.

242
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,260
Just try and consider it.

243
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,198
You'll develop an interest for it.

244
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,932
What good is this drudgery?

245
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:51,337
But managing a celebrity... It's different. It's a job with its benefits.

246
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,500
Stardom, travelling...

247
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,387
Everything is a part of your pay.

248
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,328
I highly appreciate that,

249
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:06,359
But my goals in life are a bit different.

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Here.

251
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,781
It's you, isn't it?

252
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,165
Isn't it a pleasant surprise

253
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,902
The the father of the man you gave an earful

254
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:40,460
And insulted before the world

255
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,213
Is offering you a job?

256
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,915
You were right in your place.

257
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:57,168
I wish I could all of what you did.

258
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,457
Azan's my son...

259
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,722
But out of control...

260
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:10,766
But sir,

261
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:15,480
It's not <i>my</i> job to correct your spoilt son.

262
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,487
Please don't force me.

263
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,580
Why not?

264
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,927
Just -- Why?

265
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,663
The lengths we go to for our sons...

266
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:34,102
I'm just asking for your help,

267
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,354
Because ever since I saw you,

268
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,620
I've got a feeling -

269
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,801
No idea why - that you can correct my son.

270
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,008
I've met him before, sir.

271
00:16:49,526 --> 00:16:53,010
I'd decided I'd never see him again.

272
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,130
He's an uncouth tetchy egomaniac!

273
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,240
I don't even want to see his face.

274
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,204
Aye, but there's a reason for it -- <i>Everything</i> has a reason!

275
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,220
The one he loved the most...

276
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,772
He lost her... His Mum...

277
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,974
She passed away three years ago.

278
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,854
Ever since then...

279
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:39,004
He's been... So cross with life...

280
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:42,065
That he --

281
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,972
Drowned himself in alcohol.

282
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,376
And then...

283
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:55,796
He never cared or bothered about anyone.

284
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,059
I'm his stepfather, and...

285
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,564
He never thought of me as his own.

286
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:12,851
Otherwise, perhaps today...

287
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,930
I might not have been begging you...

288
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,586
No, sir...

289
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:22,417
That won't be necessary.

290
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,080
I can't run away from my responsibility.

291
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,797
His Mum always wanted to see him happy, and...

292
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,510
I regret that I

293
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,763
Couldn't fulfil this tiny wish of hers.

294
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,280
Afreen,

295
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,344
I don't know why, but

296
00:18:56,344 --> 00:19:02,399
I'm insisting because, ever since I saw you, I got some hope...

297
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,071
I mean --

298
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,724
Let's be practical.

299
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm not having you sign a lifelong bond.

300
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,070
I'm offering you twice your salary.

301
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,339
What's it to you? You can leave anytime.

302
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:23,772
But, it's also possible

303
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:27,252
That you may be able to achieve some of your goals

304
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,376
With this salary.

305
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,959
My hands grow tired of weaving...

306
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,941
O Lord!

307
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,186
What kind of trial is this?

308
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:48,105
This salary would change the lives of Mahira, Alisha, and Mum...

309
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,659
But how would I put up with <i>him</i>?

310
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,010
What are you thinking?

311
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:00,459
O --

312
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,003
O -- Okay.

313
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,937
Thank you very much.

314
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,040
I'm sorry, I --

315
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,500
Got a bit too excited. I'm really sorry...

316
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,098
But you've given me my life's greatest happiness.

317
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,181
Don't worry.

318
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:32,795
I'll take care of you. Feel free to talk to me about any problem.

319
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:37,265
And... You may start... Today.

320
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,384
Thank you.

321
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:44,438
May we both succeed in our endeavours.

322
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,510
Amen.

323
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,382
I think I should leave. I'll join from tomorrow.

324
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,175
Sure.
-Thank you, sir.

325
00:21:33,663 --> 00:21:38,651
Good evening, Mum!
-Good evening! May you live long!

326
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:41,821
Leave it be!
-Hey!

327
00:21:41,821 --> 00:21:43,182
What happened?

328
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:46,460
All this weaving business ends today!

329
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,474
At least tell me why.

330
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,023
Start preparing for your wedding, Mahira.

331
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:55,081
You aren't kidding, are you?

332
00:21:55,335 --> 00:22:00,689
But -- At least tell me what happened?
-And you get ready for your coaching.

333
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:03,800
Care to tell me what's going on?

334
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,850
Have you hit the jackpot?

335
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,400
More like she's seen sense, Mum!

336
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,454
Get up, I'll tell you!

337
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:16,893
I got the job! I'm so happy!
-Easy there!

338
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,650
Thank you, O Lord...

339
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,139
All thanks to your prayers!

340
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:26,160
I've brought your favourite sweets. Here!

341
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,769
Bless you. Have some with me.

342
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,054
I'll go to a good salon for my makeover!

343
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:38,088
You're taking me along, right?
-Of course!

344
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:42,161
I'll get you styled for Azan's next concert!

345
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,040
You're the best!

346
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,429
<i>Afreen</i>'s got the job, but the two of you have started dreaming!

347
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:51,798
So what, Mum? Let them wish...

348
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:55,950
We've lived our lives, throttling our wishes...

349
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,771
Just let them...

350
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,315
Bless you.

351
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:03,223
You've gotten very intelligent!

352
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,336
Where's your office?

353
00:23:05,336 --> 00:23:07,704
And what are you doing?

354
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:11,820
What do I say... I'd gone to a garment factory as a manager.

355
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,770
But who knew that I'd be managing a celebrity.

356
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,717
But -- What's that?

357
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:22,790
Oh my God! Mum! She'll be with celebrities now!

358
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,875
Who are you managing?

359
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,497
Azan Ali Khan.

360
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,827
What?

361
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,173
You can't be serious!

362
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:35,683
No, I'm serious.

363
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:37,490
Oh my God!

364
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,790
I can see it happening!

365
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,100
The entire universe is conspiring to unite me and Azan!

366
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,544
This is the latest one!

367
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,308
I can't believe it!

368
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:53,215
So we can meet Azan Ali Khan anytime?
-Obviously!

369
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:57,090
What's up with you? Touched in the head?

370
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,020
No one can stop her now.

371
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,170
Aye, no one can stop me now.

372
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,400
Start preparing for my wedding, Mum!

373
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,325
There, now! Trust the robbers to arrive on time.

374
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,810
These two are out of their minds!

375
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:17,160
Go and freshen up. I'm cooking something you love!
-Ok.

376
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,600
Leave it be, Mum! Just start preparing for my wedding.

377
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,062
I'll give you a nice whacking and get this wedding mania out of you! Imbecile!

378
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:42,120
So, have you given her the job, sir?
-Of course.

379
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,499
She turned it down, but I convinced her.

380
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,861
But...

381
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:51,657
Thank you for helping me. I really appreciate that.

382
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:55,019
You'll get your payment tomorrow.

383
00:24:55,019 --> 00:25:00,833
Please don't embarrass me, sir. Happy to be of help.

384
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,848
Oh, you don't know how important this was for me.

385
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:09,018
Thanks to you.
-You're welcome.

386
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,759
A Miss Afreen Beyg's here to meet you, sir.

387
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,188
Bring her here.
-Okay, sir.

388
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,900
Good morning, sir.

389
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:36,020
Good morning. Please, take a seat.

390
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,543
Your coffee, sir.

391
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,392
She's our caretaker.

392
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:50,116
Feel free to ask her if you need anything.

393
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:53,549
Welcome, Madam. Would you like tea or coffee?

394
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,019
No, thank you.

395
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,570
Let's get straight to business, then.

396
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:04,365
The situation is right before you.

397
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,358
In fact, it won't be incorrect to say

398
00:27:09,358 --> 00:27:13,493
That <i>you</i> have created this situation.

399
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:19,568
The first order of business is to put an end to this negative publicity.

400
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:22,342
Especially from social media.

401
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:29,071
You're right, sir. But for this, Azan would have to understand and do what I say.

402
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,566
You have my full support.

403
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:35,512
Do what you must.

404
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:38,580
As for Azan...

405
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,280
I'm here if he becomes a bother.

406
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:47,754
That over there is Azan's room.

407
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:50,949
You can get to work right away.

408
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:52,854
Good luck.

409
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,722
Okay. Thank you, sir.

410
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,100
♪<i>Don't shed a tear...</i>♪

411
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,960
Ouch!

412
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,222
Don't you have common sense?

413
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:36,063
<i>You</i> broke my bottle, and instead of saying sorry, you're arguing with me!

414
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,149
Sir?

415
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,678
I'd like some coffee.

416
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:05,430
Sir... Mr Azan's sleeping.

417
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,383
Didn't you tell him about his meeting today?

418
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:12,000
You're a star's manager, Afreen.

419
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:16,541
Do you expect him to get up with the world?

420
00:29:16,541 --> 00:29:19,335
But, sir --
-But nothing.

421
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:23,969
This is precisely what you're here to fix. Go and wake him up.

422
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:26,996
Okay.

423
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,929
A --

424
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:50,651
Azan...

425
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:55,530
Please get up, Azan...

426
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,448
I love you, Meryem...

427
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:11,136
He's dreaming about some Meryem...

428
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:13,900
First, get me my juice.

429
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,400
Please.

430
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,957
Juice. Okay...

431
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,861
Excuse me.

432
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:37,104
Yes, Ma'am?

433
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,605
Where's the kitchen?

434
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:41,730
Over there. Do you want anything?

435
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,754
No, thank you.
-Most welcome!

436
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,574
Quickly with the juice, now. Mr Azan's waiting.

437
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,123
Are you talking to me?

438
00:31:19,512 --> 00:31:23,901
Obviously. Quickly, now. He's waiting.

439
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,254
I've seen you before.

440
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:31,724
I haven't got time for this. Please, give me the juice.

441
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,106
Who are you?

442
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:35,310
I'm Mr Azan's new manager.

443
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,911
Give me the juice already!

444
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,843
Omar...

445
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:03,879
What kind of girl have you hired as a manager?

446
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:05,698
Everything alright? What happened?

447
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:12,342
She barged into the kitchen when I was preparing the juice and started ordering me around like I'm a maid!

448
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:17,940
But... Why?

449
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,396
I'm sorry, sir. I thought she's also a maid.

450
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,990
No -- What's so funny about this?

451
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:37,846
I'm sorry, Meryem. It's my fault.

452
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:40,274
I should've told her.

453
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:44,408
Afreen, she's Meryem. Azan's aunt.

454
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:50,940
His only aunt. In fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say that she's more his mother.

455
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,640
I'm really sorry. First thing in the morning...

456
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,224
A blimming row. That's the blimming limit.

457
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:01,886
So you're Meryem?

458
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:03,745
Any doubts?

459
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:05,432
Let me tell you, Afreen...

460
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:14,774
Azan loves her so much. In fact, if there's anyone he ever listens to, it's Meryem.

461
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:18,260
Three years ago,

462
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,668
When Azan's mother passed away,

463
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:24,880
Meryem left everything and came here

464
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,813
To look after Azan.

465
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:33,295
Meryem and Azan cannot live without each other.

466
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,980
Please forgive me. I had no idea.

467
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:42,079
I'm the only one he's given the right to get him juice in the morning.

468
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,518
Nobody else.

469
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,543
Good morning.

470
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:53,901
Good morning.

471
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:56,816
I was waiting for you.

472
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,424
Good morning.

473
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,390
Oh -- Sorry...

474
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,351
I think we're missing the coordination.

475
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,037
Well...

476
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:19,881
Let me introduce you to Imran.

477
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:23,376
Imran is Meryem's son.

478
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:28,201
Know what, Afreen, Imran supports me in my business a lot.

479
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:32,458
Not gonna lie to you, he's my right hand man.

480
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:35,414
Azan and Imran are poles apart.

481
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:40,484
<i>He</i>'s very careless, and he's very dedicated.

482
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,946
Here's your laptop.

483
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:47,646
Thank you.

484
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:51,540
I've made a folder with everything you need to know about Azan.
-Thank you so much.

485
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,150
Come, I'll brief you on the hearing this week.

486
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,005
Sure.

487
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,550
What's this?

488
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,574
You're still asleep!

489
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,829
Get up, quick.

490
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,872
Good morning.

491
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,457
My juice...

492
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,695
Meryem...

493
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:03,082
Thank you.

494
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,254
For?

495
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:07,860
For being here.

496
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,009
Sweetening me up first thing in the morning, eh?

497
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:14,457
You think I'm just sweetening you up?

498
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:18,730
You know my mornings aren't complete

499
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,296
Without your sweet face to greet me.

500
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:27,181
I'm not at peace until I've seen you, my dear.

501
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,461
I know.

502
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:29,965
That's why...

503
00:36:29,965 --> 00:36:33,165
All of that aside, get ready quick.

504
00:36:33,165 --> 00:36:36,737
I've got you a personal secretary.

505
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,575
Who's he?
-<i>She</i>!

506
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,732
What do you mean?

507
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,235
A woman?

508
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:46,909
Yes.

509
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:49,937
How's she?

510
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,375
What kind of question is that?

511
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,326
Look at yourself.

512
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:56,296
Jealous already.

513
00:36:56,296 --> 00:37:00,126
How would you bear her with me all day?

514
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,615
No way...

515
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:03,670
Just -- Get her out.

516
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,815
Just meet her for once.

517
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:09,613
Alright, seriously.

518
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:14,358
What kind of joke is it? How could a woman be <i>my</i> manager?

519
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,451
I don't see why not!

520
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,757
But you know me so well!

521
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:22,900
I've got two cases against me already. I can't put up with her now!

522
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:30,060
Turn it to your advantage. Let <i>everyone</i> know that Azan Ali Khan's manager is a woman.

523
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,094
It'll rebuild their trust in you.

524
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:35,542
It'll improve your image.

525
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,625
Everyone will think

526
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:41,221
That you honour women. Innit?

527
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:47,590
And if she questioned <i>my</i> honour, it'd be safe to say this Azan Ali Khan's image will be dead.

528
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:53,980
You know just as well as me that I don't come back from a concert. I'm <i>brought</i> back.

529
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,720
How would a woman do <i>that</i>?

530
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,189
Don't worry.

531
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:04,965
Your Dad has hired her after a lot of thought.

532
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,044
How many times have I told you

533
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:13,306
To not call that man my Dad!

534
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:16,405
Why must you do that, Meryem?
