00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,028
<i>I'm lonely</i>

2
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,501
<i>Without you</i>

3
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:27,163
<i>No one can take your place...</i>

4
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:30,831
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

5
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:32,832
<i>Mould me...</i>

6
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,340
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

<i>My sweetheart... Translation: J. Mir © TV One</i>

00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,310
<i>Mould me... Translation: J. Mir © TV One</i>

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>Mould me...</i>

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,431
<i>Mould me in your likeness</i>

11
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,124
<i>Just the way you are...</i>

12
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,938
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:49,783

<i>My life...</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!
(Present day)

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quick!
(Present day)

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Police! Help!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Police!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, what now...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I do...?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where am I?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vanished into thin air!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's proper clever!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows where Nasir is!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The cops got him maybe?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're gonna need more men...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Abdul!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send a few more men!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's proper clever!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quick!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nasir -- No idea where he is.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find him! And send your men right now!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurry up!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A few months ago

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, superstar!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the only superstar I see, Meryem.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Juice?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here, Your Lordship.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've travelled the world, had juice at the best hotels. But I swear, I'm yet to taste something better than yours.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I guess someone knows his sweet-talk.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, how's your new manager?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's intelligent...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But super-duper boring.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't believe what she did yesterday.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She stood outside the club, waiting for me. I'd given her some money for dinner, and I thou --

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you do that, Azan?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this what your Mum and I've taught you?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember - a man who cannot respect women is no man.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got self-respect, for sure.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you take her in?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at what she wears!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know my social circle, my friends...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a star, I've got an image... How could I take that country girl with me?
-Oh?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This country girl's been looking after you all night.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came here to check.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She put you on the bed. Covered you in this blanket.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else do you want?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like her very much.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want, Meryem?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're playing matchmaker, aren't you?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think that's what you're up to!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always do what you think is the best...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time for breakfast. I'll be waiting for you.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This poem's so lovely.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of your old songs?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did you write this?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't remember writing that...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just read it... You can use it somewhere.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a song or something?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put it to some use! Make something good out of it!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, just give me ten minutes, I'll be there.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, ten minutes.
-I'm so late...

82
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:41,832
Out of the frying pan into the tea!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry, sir...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No... It's okay.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll clean it, sir...
-It's okay.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really impressed, by the way. I never thought you'd be able to put up with Azan for more than a day.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry, sir...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're doing a great job.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan's calling you. Something about his papers... Help him, will you?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure, ma'am.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I spilled tea on him, I'm sure the old geezer would've had me wash his shirt five times.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to speak of his fury if the stain didn't go!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, blimey, looking at how he let Afreen go... Something seems off!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I want...</i>

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nope. Not quite feelin' it.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>All I want</i>

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Is to live...</i>

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Is to live in your shade...</i>

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's written here? Can't read a thing...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Live in your shade for --'

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Live --'

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'In your shade --'
-'Forever'.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you know about my song?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You stole my song!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh God...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't I think of this before?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh? Hit the enlightenment now?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, Madam... You can steal my words, but who's gonna work on the composition?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There can only be one rockstar.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan Ali Khan.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No doubt.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way... Meryem told me you took good care of me all night.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly speaking, though, I don't remember a thing.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why you shouldn't get drunk.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It makes you forget everything. Even feelings.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got no idea how I got home last night.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't even have dinner.
-Excuse me!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I offered you money to get something.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might've considered it if you'd offered me dinner.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd offer you dinner?

122
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:59,799
In your dreams!

123
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,715
How can you forget?

124
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,605
I hate you!

125
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,911
Funny coincidence. I hate you too!

126
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,782
Thank you.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're meeting a record company today.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In an hour. So, please get ready quick.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan Ali Khan hasn't fallen so low as to take orders from you.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to meet anyone. Go.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just thought... It was a new record company interested in producing a new album with you.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your company's in debt. This might've helped.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's okay if you don't want to go...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not meeting anyone!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just tell you? I don't want to meet anyone!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact... I'll meet them. Because why not?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not because you ordered me.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I want to. Remember that, okay?

141
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,791
Blimey, I'm changing! Go out, will you? Or would you rather see everything?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, sorry...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you have any other T-shirt or pants?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the problem with these?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... So it comes to this!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone with a nonexistent fashion sense is gonna tell me what to wear!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, you got guts.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I just meant you could've changed...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your hair look so weird...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but it looks like a bomb went off in your face.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with my hair?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No surprise.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't blame you. What tastes could I expect from someone who should've been born a couple centuries ago?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And know what, you're dealing with Azan Ali Khan.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't find someone who's got a style like me.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... What else do I have to teach you?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder when ripped jeans became 'fashion'...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you say?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- We're late for the meeting... Let's go?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually... Wait. Sit.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?
-Sit.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait for me. I'll be back in a moment.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
-Wait here.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's messin' with you.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?
-Really.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make a run for it, he'll be leaving! Double time!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you! Thank you so much!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Welcome, Mr Azan.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're excited to be working on this album with you.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you. Please, take a seat.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like to hear something new.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

181
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:09,484
<i>Like dew on autumn leaves,</i>

182
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,174
<i>This fragrance through the air cleaves...</i>

183
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:17,894
<i>A whiff of you - can it be?</i>

184
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:20,755
<i>Like a shore washed by the sea,</i>

185
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,414
<i>Shooting stars, whoopee!</i>

186
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:28,735
<i>The light of my life, can you be?</i>

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Azan...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you got something else?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, something exciting?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan, why don't you play what you were humming earlier today?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know just what I want to show them.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan... Can't you see? They're bored.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave this one... It needs more work. Show me something else.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, sir. That one's really good, sir! I'm not saying much because I'm his manager.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you'd love it!

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Let's see if it's any good.

198
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:34,962
<i>All I want</i>

199
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:37,905
<i>Is to live in your shade</i>

200
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:44,017
<i>Forever...</i>

201
00:16:44,017 --> 00:16:46,726
<i>Sipping the nectar</i>

202
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:49,336
<i>Dripping from your lips</i>

203
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:54,467
<i>Every morning...</i>

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every morning...</i>
-Wonderful!</i>

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every morning...</i>
-This is it!</i>

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is it!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely lyrics! Fantastic melody! This is the real deal!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your choice is so good.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your manager's very smart.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're lucky.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, finish this song.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll make it the title song of the album.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This'll give us the title for the album.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll discuss more details on the content in the next meeting.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations again.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is Azan Ali Khan!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saw that?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should thank me.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My poor manager...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for what? It's my song they loved!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For writing this down and reminding you here.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it... I never knew my manager worked so hard!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't really expect anything else from you.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want appreciation, don't you?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. You'll get your share soon.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise...

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll appreciate you... My way.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coming?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's your new manager?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hot, isn't she?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's she looking at me like that, mate?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop laughing at her. Her bite hurts as much as her bark!

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Afreen!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't go anywhere.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my order.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was that, Azan?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec. I'll tell you.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know. You're dying to dance with me.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You feel bad I'm talking to the ladies.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.
-Oh?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're jealous. I can see it on your face.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, who was he?

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, him!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a bookie.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've 'invested' in a cricket match. Get it? I like it.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you do that, Azan?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any idea about the money?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've borrowed so much already!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I want to do right now is thank you... For getting me the contract.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, for that, you can dance with me. That's what you want, innit?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ouch!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey! Snake dance?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So lovely! I swear!

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get you the contract, and you do this?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, my poor baby... How couldn't I thank you?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to drown your life like that?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so talented...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you want to destroy everything?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'm lonely</i>

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Without you</i>

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No one can take your place...</i>

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Mould me...</i>

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Mould me...</i>

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Mould me in your likeness</i>

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Just the way you are...</i>

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life...</i>

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My sweetheart...</i>

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life...</i>

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How was that, Mum?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice. Just fantastic!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? You like it?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course! It's so lovely!

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It may be lovely, but not more than you.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're in the mood for jokes?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honest. Work on it. It'll be a hit, I tell you!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't believe me?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe it because you've supported everything I did - right or wrong.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You appreciate every melody I work on.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you always said, 'No one can be more beautiful than you, Mum'?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is true!

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you won't say that after your marriage.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll forget your Mum.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I'll never go back on my word.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And forget you?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Impossible.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you, Mum.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you too, my dear. I'll pray for you.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord give you success.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May you be happy.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Likewise.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you get up?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just waiting for you.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to your foot?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing, really.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're injured!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A woman stepped on my toe in the bus. That's all.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't she see?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, I'll get you some ice...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Present day

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't shoot me!

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a water gun! It ain't killin' nobody!

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait! Stop! Or I'll shoot! Stop!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You dimwit! Can't you see where you're going?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd get water for us now?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me some money! I want your money!

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry -- I didn't see you coming -- Really --

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such nerve! You can't even walk straight! C'mon, give me the money!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't got any!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care, I want your money!

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I give you anything? Just let me go! Leave me --
-No! I won't let you go until you've given me your money!
-Stop right there!

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me go!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd she go?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're with her! Give me the money!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Geroff, you crazy woman!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's there? Come out with your hands up!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you? A thief!

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! Dad!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saw a woman 'round here?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see you're a thief!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! Dad! Hurry up!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. He's gone.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you crying? He's gone.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your name?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Azan.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want appreciation, don't you?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. You'll get your share soon.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll appreciate you... My way.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here. It's cold.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?
-Yeah?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's cold. You might need this.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd your mother fight if we gave up?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My dear...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get married while I'm still here...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Mum's not well.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen or talked to her in three days.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your name?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Afreen...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't remember much of it... But some people kidnapped me...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone you had a row with?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but of course...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you have a row with anyone?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like you've got millions... Who are they? What do they want from you?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I know is that your son's very nice.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He helped me so much.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's wise beyond his years.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You fell asleep...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looked sick and tired. So I didn't wake you up.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But seriously... You should leave.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't mind it... I work hard all day to feed them and myself.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very poor.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want any trouble.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please try to understand.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Go.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We should call the police and help her, or they'll get her.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't have the police to get involved. Not good.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so sorry, but you should leave.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got nowhere to go... I don't know anyone.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you tell me where I am?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gadap Town.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gadap Town?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how far is DHA Karachi?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two hours by bus.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bus?

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where could I get the bus?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the highway.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you take me there?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I know the way.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait! Don't get involved in this! Shut up!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better go on your own. Take that road and turn left.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just go.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't know the way, Mum. We should help her.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like it if you lost your way and nobody helped you?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, go.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave her at the stop and come back quickly.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're in for a beating if you're late!

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go. Quick!

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.
-Get going.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't walk anymore... How far is it?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just five more minutes... We can wait if you like.
-Okay.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boss...

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've found her.
