Quickly!

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,790
What happened?
-Omar Khan's informed the police!

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,850
They're coming!
(Present day)

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,970
Untie her! Quick!
(Present day)

20
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,805
Hurry up!
(Present day)

21
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,809
Double time!

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,345
Come! Quickly!
-There!

23
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:24,420
Omar Khan's found out. He won't spare you.

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,442
Nor will the police.

25
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:31,033
For the love of God, let me go! I won't tell anyone!
-Hurry up!

26
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:36,004
Or I'll fill you with lead right here. Get up!

27
00:01:36,736 --> 00:01:39,410
Here.
-Quickly!

28
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,190
Get a move on!

29
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,341
In there!

30
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,008
Come.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,880
A few months ago

32
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,658
So you want to be my new manager...

33
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,868
What's your name?

34
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,818
Afreen Beyg.

35
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,297
Hmm...

36
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:37,868
Sounds familiar.

37
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,967
Anyway...

38
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,450
Which of my songs is your favourite?

39
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,683
None.

40
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:54,904
<i>You</i>!

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,466
What kind of scene are you here to create <i>now</i>?

42
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:09,873
Please -- put -- something on...

43
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,187
You're getting uncomfortable...

44
00:03:14,187 --> 00:03:16,167
Know what...

45
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:21,734
My female fans die to see me this way.

46
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,891
But...

47
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,051
You're so middle-class. I know!

48
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:41,751
But actually, you're a drama queen. A man who, just yesterday, was a bad role model corrupting the youth and was just a very bad man...

49
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:46,222
I'm just surprised to know you want to be his manager today!

50
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:53,009
I think you changed your mind. You want to go about 'corrupting' people with me, innit?

51
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:59,560
It's nothing like that, Mr Az --
-I don't want another word from you, Miss Afreen Beyg; you've already said enough!

52
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,065
I've heard a lot about me in the news.

53
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,645
I saw the news.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,775
I think this is the moment I should capture and go live.

55
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:15,940
Innit?

56
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,344
Let the fans know who's droppin' by!

57
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,351
Just a minute.

58
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,346
Okay.

59
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,178
We're going live now.

60
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:33,374
Aren't you excited? I think you are!

61
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:37,203
Okay, we're live! Hello, hip-hoppers and rock 'n rollers!

62
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:43,978
This is Azan Ali Khan, and I'm here to tell you who's in the house.

63
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:49,576
My new manager. Surprised to see her? I was, too!

64
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:56,769
Like, I was the worst man in the world for her. The most vile, the most insolent...

65
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,130
But tell me...

66
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,641
Should I have her as my manager?

67
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:07,409
Please, start voting now and tell me.

68
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:13,148
Let's see what they're saying... Actually, you got zero votes!

69
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,463
Baby...

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,054
My fans

71
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,371
Reject you.

72
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:21,692
You are

73
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,684
You are <i>rejected</i>!

74
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:27,514
Yes!
-What are you doing!?

75
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,001
What was that?

76
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,947
Please deduct it from my salary.
-You're fired.

77
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:47,787
You may leave. Get out.

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,904
Actually... You can't fire me.

79
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,938
You're still here? Jeez, what are you?

80
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:11,082
Arguing with me at <i>my</i> place, in <i>my</i> room! Please, get out!

81
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:15,319
Your father, Omar Khan, has appointed me.

82
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,698
No one else can fire me.

83
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,916
Don't you dare

84
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:58,568
Call <i>that man</i> my father again!

85
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,111
Okay...

86
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,943
You'll go if Omar Khan asks you, eh? C'mon.

87
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:10,026
Have it your way.

88
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,006
What the devil is going on, Meryem?

89
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:45,115
She <i>can't</i> be my manager!

90
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,879
Why?

91
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,098
Why not?

92
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:50,039
What's up with you?

93
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,940
How can you even --

94
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,071
The woman responsible for such a huge mess!

95
00:07:56,071 --> 00:08:00,724
You want to make <i>her</i> my manager!

96
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,392
Fair enough.

97
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:03,712
Just for once.

98
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:05,257
Meryem.

99
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,299
Once.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,960
Take a good look at her.

101
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,290
Look at her.

102
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:18,540
Does she look <i>one bit</i> like the manager of an artist, of Azan Ali Khan, the rockstar?

103
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,066
Why, what's wrong?

104
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:26,110
There's a problem with how you think!

105
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:32,508
Her simplicity is your problem,

106
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:38,024
Because the managers before her had left no quarter to destroy you!

107
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,670
Meryem...

108
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:41,930
Honestly?

109
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,152
Like -- seriously?

110
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,590
So it's come to this!

111
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,911
<i>She</i>'d be <i>my</i> manager!

112
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,104
I have no issues with her, Meryem. It's nothing personal.

113
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:58,110
I don't wish her bad.

114
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,971
Why don't you get it -- She just can't be my manager!

115
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:09,392
And my fans have rejected her in a moment! So, the chapter's closed!

116
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:12,006
I have already decided!

117
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:17,337
You or your fans are nothing before my decision!

118
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:22,396
Afreen will be your manager. Understood?
-Splendid...

119
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,915
Splendid indeed, sir...

120
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:29,862
You've got a problem with her simplicity, eh?

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,399
Wasn't your Mum like that?

122
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:37,330
Don't drag Mum into this!

123
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,894
Not a word about her!
-Your Mum was my wife!

124
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:45,978
I don't want to talk about anything. I've told you my decision!

125
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:49,950
This adamance will get you nothing. Everything's been decided.

126
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,586
Understood?

127
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,132
I'm really sorry, sir...

128
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,218
I don't want your family to have a row over me.

129
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:06,111
I'll find another job.

130
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:09,017
I think I should leave.

131
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:12,746
No -- Afreen -- Please don't say that.

132
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:19,460
He -- He's down the road to his own ruin -- Only you can stop him, so please...

133
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,852
Don't go.

134
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,773
I'm really sorry, sir.

135
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,815
Thank you.

136
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,248
You're back already?

137
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,925
What happened?

138
00:10:56,737 --> 00:11:00,398
How was your first day at work?

139
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,802
Fine...

140
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:06,490
Doesn't seem like it. What happened?

141
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,756
No, it's nothing. It was good.

142
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,083
May you always be happy.

143
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:18,488
Know what, I turned down an order for the first time!

144
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm going to put this sewing machine away.

145
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,350
Your sisters are going crazy. I mean -- Just look at the young lass!

146
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,580
She got a form from a coaching centre.
-Forget <i>that</i>, Mum!

147
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:38,932
What's my marital home like? It's up to my standards, right?

148
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:43,179
I'm sure Azan must be asking <i>a lot</i> about me!

149
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,607
Don't give it too much importance!

150
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:48,716
Tell him he can meet me anytime.

151
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:53,582
Jeez, be done with it already. It was her first day at work.

152
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:57,626
She must be tired. Get her some tea.

153
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,910
Omar, must Azan's manager be a woman?

154
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,824
Seeing her brought back some memories.

155
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:48,676
I had a teacher like her at school...

156
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,272
Miss Parveen.

157
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:53,452
She was about her age and dressed up like her.

158
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:59,398
We'd spot her and say loudly, 'It's the dame'!

159
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,362
You were saying something, Mr Omar?

160
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,221
Meryem...

161
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,906
I'm doing what's best for Azan.

162
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,830
And...

163
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,906
I'm sure you would've seen that Afreen looked very confident.

164
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,060
She lives a simple life in this materialistic world. She's got her principles straight.

165
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:36,427
Unlike his previous managers, she won't let Azan screw anything up.

166
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:40,270
You know Azan only too well.

167
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:46,615
He's drunk every other moment, and mired in a new scandal every other day.

168
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm sure he won't make a mess

169
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,560
When someone like Afreen is with him. What do you think?

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,031
I think Mr Omar's thought a lot before hiring her.

171
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,779
And we should trust his choice.

172
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,904
But she's left...

173
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,312
I'd take this as your acceptance.

174
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:19,917
Thank you.

175
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:22,001
Thank you so much.

176
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,672
You made the right decision.

177
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,345
And...

178
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:31,045
Don't fear or worry about Azan.

179
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:35,107
If he's ever a bother,

180
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,190
Feel free to come to me,

181
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,645
Or Meryem.

182
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,997
That won't be necessary, sir.

183
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:49,294
I've faced many challenges in my life. I'll handle it.

184
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,149
Imran...

185
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,812
Thank you, sir.

186
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:00,901
Don't call me 'sir'. I'm not one bit the sir-type!

187
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,551
You're still here?

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,775
I thought there's something called 'self-respect'.

189
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,810
But it seems you've got none.

190
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,510
Doesn't it hurt you?

191
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,710
It does.

192
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,938
But only if it's sincere and sensible.

193
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,860
I won't even touch you,

194
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,210
Because I remember Mum's upbringing,

195
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:30,980
But I'll make your life <i>so miserable</i>, I promise,

196
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,887
That you'll beg Omar Khan to get to resign!

197
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm telling you, I don't like you one bit.

198
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,411
I don't like you one bit either.

199
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,430
At least <i>I</i> know how to dress.

200
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,767
I dress up decently.

201
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:56,125
No ripped jeans or hideous hairdos!

202
00:16:56,501 --> 00:17:00,031
I don't know why people love you so much.

203
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,293
Seriously?

204
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,624
Wow...

205
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,927
An unenlightened woman

206
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:08,386
Lecturing me on fashion!

207
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:11,536
I mean -- Jeez, that's the last straw!

208
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:14,134
What's your qualification?

209
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,170
I'm a graduate.

210
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,568
I've done my master's.

211
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,558
Who's the more unenlightened now?

212
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:24,735
That ego will have to wait.

213
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,483
You've got a meeting with a sponsor.

214
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,482
Right.

215
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,138
I'm going.

216
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:43,120
But don't take it

217
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,790
It's because of you.

218
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,834
I'm going because <i>I</i> want to. Are we clear?

219
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,673
Whatever.

220
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,974
Jeez, what a stupid office!

221
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:28,661
Where do we go?

222
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:30,001
Azan...

223
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,938
Take off your glasses and see...

224
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:37,459
Shut up and wait for me. I'll be back after the meeting.

225
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,014
Okay?

226
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:41,422
Where's the room?

227
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,872
How are you, Mr Rana?
-Fine.

228
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,644
But... You?
-She's my maid.

229
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,301
I mean...

230
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,340
My new manager.

231
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,008
Oh...

232
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,694
I like your style. Our generation's forgotten that there's true beauty in simplicity.

233
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,198
Thank you.

234
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,795
It's <i>her</i>.

235
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,726
So it's <i>you</i>!

236
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:40,373
The girl from the viral video?

237
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,374
You're with Azan?

238
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:46,462
Yes, that's me.

239
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,789
The video had been edited

240
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,969
To hurt Azan's image.

241
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,336
You know what it is with social media only too well...

242
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:59,975
The media folks just need an excuse... Anyway, nice to see you.

243
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:03,890
Alright, let's talk business, then, Azan.

244
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:09,980
You know your position very well, Mr Azan. We can't fund you.

245
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,461
Your controversies are more famous than your songs!
-You can't be serious!

246
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:20,476
You've been working with Azan for so long. Been on international tours too. All superhits!

247
00:20:20,476 --> 00:20:25,474
That's history. There's nothing in the present even close to success.

248
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:30,553
Can I say something?
-Please shut up!

249
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,137
Yes?
-I'd like to ask you, sir...

250
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:39,830
There's so many singers in Pakistan. Many foreign singers famous through YouTube as well.

251
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,410
Why do you want to do this show with Azan?

252
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,971
Shut up!

253
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,016
Do you know <i>anything</i>? I've been with them for years!

254
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,953
Out!

255
00:20:54,436 --> 00:21:01,213
Azan's got a following, but it's dwindling, thanks to his recent songs...

256
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,636
It'll be ages before he loses his following.

257
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:08,821
In any case, Azan's signing the contract only if you give him a 10% raise.

258
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:13,510
Otherwise, you've always got the option of a new singer...
-Are you mad?

259
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:19,988
What are you doing? Why do you want to ruin my career? Why are you in my life at all? Get out!

260
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,898
I'm sorry...

261
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:24,925
But it won't be possible.

262
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:28,918
Okay, sir. No problem. Thank you for your time.

263
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
But --

264
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,008
Why do you want to ruin my life?

265
00:21:37,008 --> 00:21:39,890
Why did you come here?

266
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,193
Please stop him, sir...

267
00:21:42,193 --> 00:21:44,819
Wait, Azan...

268
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:48,736
Listen to me for once...

269
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,190
10%'s nothing. And we're for nothing below it.

270
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,890
We're meeting other sponsors too. They may have better offers.

271
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,603
But...

272
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,971
Oh...

273
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:14,790
Perhaps something I don't know. Go on.

274
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,010
Alright.

275
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,090
Thank you. We'll get going.

276
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,410
Please, sit. Where are you going? I agree.

277
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,357
I accept your terms.

278
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:39,960
I agree. Tell me when you're signing the contract.
-Alright, then. Pleased to be working with you again.

279
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,275
Please prepare the contract. We'll sign it after our legal team's gone through it.

280
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:52,178
Congratulations, Mr Azan. You've got a wonderful manager.

281
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,520
What is this? I don't understand...

282
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,289
We're meeting other sponsors? Why didn't you tell me?

283
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:10,742
You aren't as smart as you look...
-Get to the point.

284
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:15,051
The point, Mr Azan, is there's no other sponsor. No other meeting.

285
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:17,551
Nor does anyone want to work with you.

286
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:21,090
That bluff in there was something I had to do.

287
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,875
I get it...

288
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,975
Very well...

289
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,451
But don't think you've won.

290
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,174
You haven't.
-I know. <i>You</i>'ve won.

291
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:35,151
Whatever! Remember,

292
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:39,367
I absolutely loathe you!

293
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,540
Hello?

294
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,995
Would you follow me in here, too?

295
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:11,424
It's my job to be with you.

296
00:24:11,424 --> 00:24:16,600
This isn't a business meeting, madam, I'm here for leisure. I can't take you inside.

297
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,476
I've got some respect. And by the way, you must be angry...

298
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,508
Here's some money,

299
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:25,895
Go and

300
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:28,130
Have something.

301
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,021
Find something.

302
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,590
I'm your manager, not your maid. Thank you so much.

303
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,631
Your loss!

304
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:39,679
Guard! Take care of the lady.

305
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,605
Make sure she doesn't walk in.

306
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,672
Eyes on her.

307
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,460
It's been so long...

308
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,606
He didn't even bother to ask!

309
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,315
Hello, Mum!
-Where are you, Afreen?

310
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:22,390
I've been trying to call you for so long, but didn't have any balance!

311
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,046
You didn't call to tell me anything!

312
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:29,873
Don't worry, Mum. I'll be a bit late.

313
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:32,001
But why?

314
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm with Mr Azan and he's dropped dead inside the club!

315
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,056
Then, just come back home. Call and tell him.

316
00:26:41,056 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you know how long I've been trying? He just isn't answering!

317
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,503
Did you have anything at all?

318
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:50,850
I'll talk when I'm back.

319
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,679
Bye.

320
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,288
Don't touch me.

321
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,940
Don't touch me...

322
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,130
I can take care of myself.

323
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,757
Alright, I'll get going.

324
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:24,799
Wait, Afreen.

325
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:26,912
Your job isn't done yet.

326
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,897
You've got to come home.

327
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,672
But...

328
00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:32,490
Not with me.

329
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:36,755
Take an auto, taxi... Whatever... Okay?

330
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,862
You wouldn't have the money.

331
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,889
How much would you need?

332
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:45,328
100? That enough?

333
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:49,970
Keep your money. I'll do on my own.

334
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:52,223
As you wish!

335
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,152
But...

336
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,554
Do come.

337
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:56,855
I'll be waiting.

338
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,043
Azan... I'll take my leave.

339
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,225
Just one wish...

340
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,843
To live in your shade...

341
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:02,550
Just me... Forever...

342
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,768
Sipping the nectar...

343
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,883
Dripping from your lips...

344
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,610
Every morning...

345
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Azan...

346
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:37,913
It's wonderful... Say it again, will you?

347
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,490
Sipping the nectar...

348
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,090
Dripping from your lips...

349
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,164
Every morning...

350
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:58,980
Your love has bewitched me...

351
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,522
I'm nought without you...

352
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,513
For you...

353
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,845
You are my world...

354
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:28,950
Thank goodness. You're asleep...

355
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,670
A --

356
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,419
Azan... Please lie down straight.

357
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,602
Azan! I'm leaving. Please lie down straight.

358
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,660
Where are you going at this hour? Rest in the guest room. It's almost morning.

359
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,335
No, I'll go...
-Leave when it's day. Go.

360
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,960
Okay.

361
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,308
No sense to help her Mum!

362
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:42,259
This Mahira's sitting here scrubbing her hands!

363
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,560
At least cut the onions for the omelette!

364
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,213
What's up with these lowly chores every moment, Mum?

365
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,175
I just got this manicure and pedicure!

366
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,808
You make my blood pressure shoot up!

367
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:04,519
Good morning, Mum.
-Bless you, my dear.

368
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:09,950
You're coming <i>now</i>? I thought you're sleeping.

369
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,541
But...

370
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:15,940
Do they want everything done in a day?

371
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:19,059
Oh my God! Is Azan with you?

372
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,996
He can't see me like this! You should've told!

373
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:25,960
Blimey, Mahira. Isn't it enough that I'm here?

374
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,390
I'll get you your breakfast. Have it and get some rest.

375
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,535
Leave it be. I'll d --
-But you've just come back! And <i>you</i>!

376
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:35,820
Get ready for college!

377
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,226
The dratted college again! When will I get rid of it and when will I get married to Azan?

378
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,690
Mum...

379
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,316
How many times have I told you not to worry?

380
00:34:48,316 --> 00:34:51,492
I'm just worried about you. Take care of yourself.

381
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:54,380
But I get <i>very</i> worried.

382
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,420
Any other job would be far better...

383
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,120
I can get back to weaving...

384
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,640
I've got a lot of work.

385
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,080
I mean...

386
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,674
Nothing above health...

387
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:09,740
You'll get sick.

388
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,799
Easy, Mum.

389
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:18,165
Besides... Nobody else would offer me the salary Mr Omar did.

390
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:19,926
Please don't worry.

391
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:23,563
And I know there's a bit of an issue about the time...

392
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:26,752
But I'm sure you'll adjust in time.

393
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:31,171
So will you be out all night?

394
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,936
No, Mum...

395
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:39,465
I mean -- well, yes -- who cares about days and nights in this job?

396
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:43,773
He's such a big star... He has his own time.

397
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:46,728
Don't worry. Everything will be alright.

398
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,288
I'm just worried for your health.

399
00:35:49,288 --> 00:35:53,588
I can take care of myself, Mum.

400
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:57,179
I'm just worried about you. Take care.

401
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:00,678
Alright... As you see fit...

402
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:05,900
So, tell me, what's Azan Ali Khan like in real life?

403
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,036
He's quite the egomaniac.

404
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:10,943
I haven't seen one like him.

405
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:15,977
No idea what he thinks of himself! And look at the height of madness!

406
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:21,720
Always admiring himself in the mirror! Always waltzing about the house wearing shades!

407
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,510
Guess his favourite pastime? Pulling <i>my</i> leg!

408
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:32,124
The two of you would have quite the slanging match! Must be fun!

409
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,466
By the way...

410
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:41,795
You have no idea how much your Granny insulted me for not having a son.

411
00:36:42,263 --> 00:36:45,770
But I'm so glad to see you...

412
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,180
You're dearer than 10 sons to me.

413
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,289
Hey... Don't get too emotional. I'll go change. We'll have breakfast together. Okay?

414
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,254
What's with this cough, Mum?
-I'm fine.

415
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:21,702
I'll get you water.

416
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,743
Floor it!

417
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:48,140
Present day

418
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,224
Roadblock ahead, boss! What do we do?

419
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,280
Stop it!

420
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,400
Take the road.

421
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,990
I'll meet you at the old hideout.

422
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,816
Alright, sir.
-Please let me go...

423
00:38:20,816 --> 00:38:25,863
I won't tell anyone. I swear!
-Quiet!

424
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:28,008
Gag her!

425
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,210
She's proper lippy! Quick!
