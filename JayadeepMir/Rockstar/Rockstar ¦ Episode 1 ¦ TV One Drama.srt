1
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,300
I've been trying for so long...
-She must be on her way...

2
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,930
Why bother walking?
-Strange...

3
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,070
You took so long, Afreen...

4
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,130
Where to, darling?
-I have no interest in music...

5
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,980
Good Lord, look at her!
-Youse alls don't know me.

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,380
I love him so much!

7
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,671
I'll make your life <i>so miserable</i>

8
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:11,562
That you'll beg to get to resign!

9
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,514
A few months back...

10
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,728
What a wonderful place...

11
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,920
Those who get to work here are so fortunate...

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,974
O Lord, please help me, too...

13
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:07,243
Just get me a job here...

14
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:11,590
Even if it doesn't pay me as much...

15
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,046
Please, O Lord, hear my prayer...

16
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,403
Miss Afreen?

17
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:22,404
That'd be me.

18
00:02:22,404 --> 00:02:24,091
The boss' room is over there.

19
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:27,372
Please.
-Thank you so much.

20
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,990
May I come in, sir?
-Yes.

21
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,680
Please, take a seat.

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,183
Thank you.

23
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,410
I got your CV.

24
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:05,814
So it's <i>you</i> that that song is about...

25
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:08,810
'Afreen, Afreen'! [Beautiful]

26
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,341
'I have no words to praise my beloved'...

27
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,502
Well, sir... I have no interest in music...

28
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,158
Strange...

29
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,852
You're into media studies but have no interest in music?

30
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,418
Well, sir -- I've specialised in media management.

31
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,135
And that's exactly what I'm interested in.

32
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:34,821
Good.

33
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:37,307
But you'd do well to understand

34
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,105
That real life

35
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:42,529
Is very different

36
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:45,638
From what you've studied.

37
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:50,372
The realities of the job are, so to speak, quite the opposite.

38
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,580
So...

39
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,977
Yes...

40
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,715
What brings you to me?

41
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:09,835
Let me see...

42
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,610
Azan Ali Khan's embroiled in another 'Me Too' scandal!

43
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:29,967
A renowned actress states that Azan Ali Khan promised to cast her in his video, and sexually harassed her in the name of an audition!

44
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:37,040
Viewers may be aware that this is the second time the singer's been accused of something like this.

45
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,524
A matter had come up last year as well, but this time, actress and model Alizeh has decided to go to court.

46
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,948
She says she's got all the witnesses and evidence.

47
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:53,007
Once again, Azan Ali Khan's silence makes things tough for him.

48
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:55,551
We couldn't get in t--

49
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,264
Would you look at that!

50
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:59,676
Everyone wants to make the news

51
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:02,516
No matter how low he has to fall for it.

52
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:06,123
He hasn't sung one decent song in five years.

53
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:09,983
But girls are head over heels for him!

54
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,441
Are you his fan too?

55
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,160
No, sir.

56
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,129
I don't know him,

57
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,999
And, after hearing this news, I don't even want to.

58
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,016
You don't know Azan Khan?

59
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,866
He's the girls' favourite star!

60
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,629
No, sir.

61
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,188
Strange...

62
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,845
Did you see my writing samples that I'd mailed you, sir?

63
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,329
No.

64
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,465
I've seen what I had to.

65
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,250
Sir? I didn't quite get it...

66
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,962
Don't worry.

67
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:54,109
You want this job? You'll get it. In fact, you could say you've already got it.

68
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:55,857
Seriously?

69
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,445
I'm honest.

70
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,404
One look at you was enough.

71
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:05,499
But you haven't even had a look at my certificates, sir...

72
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:09,582
None of that has any value here...

73
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:12,965
Now, tell me,

74
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:17,699
What can you do to get this position?

75
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,317
Believe me, sir, I'll do my best.

76
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:36,833
You don't know -- My mother's toiled hard to educate us and get us here.

77
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:41,940
I want to achieve my goals. All of them.

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,004
And give her everything

79
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,210
She would only have dreamt of.

80
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,865
Alright, hold on...

81
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,680
I am confident you'll do all of <i>that</i>.

82
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,209
What <i>else</i> can you do?

83
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,834
Sir?

84
00:06:57,363 --> 00:07:00,269
What else -- sir?

85
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,148
Oh, come on...

86
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,142
I'm offering you the job of a personal secretary.

87
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:10,825
It'll do you good.

88
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:16,805
You'll be earning more than you can ever imagine.

89
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,670
Now, it's up to you.

90
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,675
You have to prove that I've done the right thing.

91
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,981
Sir... I'm very dedicated.

92
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,338
You won't have any complaints.

93
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:31,541
But I'm only interested in media management.

94
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,590
You can do that, too.

95
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,520
But first, come...

96
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,433
As my secretary, you'll have to be <i>very close</i> to me...

97
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:45,192
You need to work on your looks, though.

98
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,072
Be more open.

99
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:53,719
You've got such a lovely personality, Afreen. Why do you want to keep it under the wraps?

100
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:55,579
And yes,

101
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,430
Whatever happens between a boss and his secretary

102
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,322
Stays between them.

103
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,410
If you accept the deal...

104
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,298
Shall we?

105
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,275
You vile lowlife!

106
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:30,945
<i>You'd do well</i> to remember this slap before leching after another woman!

107
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,159
Good evening, sir.

108
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,170
Is there a bus station nearby?

109
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,487
You won't get a bus at this hour, but you can get a rickshaw from over there.

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,330
Alright, thanks.

111
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Good evening.
-Evening.

112
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,100
Can you take me to North Asmabad?
-Sure. It'll be 400 Rupees.

113
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,577
I've only got 200.
-Sorry, ma'am...

114
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:30,279
Well, then...

115
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,235
How about 300, ma'am?

116
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,203
No, thanks. I haven't got 300.

117
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,021
Where to, darling?

118
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:03,298
I can give you a ride. Why bother walking?

119
00:10:04,131 --> 00:10:06,285
How's <i>that</i> for an answer?

120
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:10,441
Bleedin' leches! Begone or I'll kill you for real!

121
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,894
Slippering <i>him</i> broke my slipper...

122
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,997
Uncouth cads.

123
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,180
You don't know! Mahira Beyg will soon be Mahira Azan!

124
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,309
Why are you changing your name?

125
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:46,674
Dumbo! My name will obviously be Mahira Azan once I'm married to Azan Khan.

126
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:50,239
<i>You</i>? Married to Azan Ali Khan?

127
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:53,023
Every girl's dream, yes,

128
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,885
But I'm marrying him!

129
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:58,120
How do you know? Besides...

130
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,981
All the actresses are head over heels for him.

131
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:03,085
Haven't you heard about that scandal?

132
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:07,520
The model Alizeh sued him right after their breakup!

133
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,394
All lies! Please don't believe any of that guff!

134
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,927
Youse alls don't know me.

135
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:19,534
Bet you I'll click a picture with him on the stage today!

136
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,838
Hey, boys and girls! Are you ready for the sensational rockstar, Azan Ali Khan?

137
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,800
Oh my God! Azan!

138
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,832
You took so long, Afreen...

139
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:14,193
And... I've been trying to call Mahira for so long! It's 9 and she hasn't come back yet!

140
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,029
Don't worry, Mum. Sit.

141
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,656
Here.

142
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:25,262
Bless you, dear...

143
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,460
Find out about Mahira. I'm really worried.

144
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,218
It's very late.

145
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:39,893
She's not a kid, Mum. She must be on her way...

146
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:40,610
Alright...

147
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,273
How'd your interview go?

148
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:46,427
Any success?

149
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,647
Don't worry, my dear...

150
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:58,345
Finding a good job takes time...

151
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,801
By the way...

152
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,991
Why is your sandal broken?

153
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,010
It's --

154
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,900
It's -- Nothing really, Mum...

155
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,770
How many times have I asked you to take a bus or rickshaw?

156
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,357
I don't have so much money, Mum.

157
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,786
Just enough to walk...

158
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:22,427
Don't worry about me.

159
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,820
How many times have I asked you to take care of your health?

160
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,655
I'll take care of everything else.

It's Mahira! Mum! Look!
-Where?

172
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,701
Hey! Where --
-Not at the door, Mum. Here!

173
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,460
Heavens, look at her!

174
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,893
Look at her dance with all the makeup!

175
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:18,240
She took 2,000 from me for 'extra classes' today!

176
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,128
Good Lord, her lies!

177
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:25,003
I'm working hard to earn,

178
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,300
And she's squandering it all!

179
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,833
How'd she go there?

180
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,986
And how come <i>you</i> don't know anything?

181
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:33,836
No -- I really don't.

182
00:15:33,836 --> 00:15:36,361
I would've gone there if I knew!

183
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,162
I love him so much!

184
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,333
As if I would've let either of you go!

185
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,920
Just -- <i>Who</i> is he?

186
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,666
Don't you know Azan Ali Khan?

187
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,989
Mahira and I are his biggest fans!

188
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,319
Whatever is it he's got?

189
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,085
Do you know he's Pakistan's most famous singer?

190
00:15:55,085 --> 00:16:01,413
His film came out recently! All its songs were hits! And I remembered every one of them!

191
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:04,556
Be done with your plaudits already.

192
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:08,585
From what I've heard, he hasn't come up with a single hit for long.

193
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:11,581
He only makes the news because of the scandals!

194
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:14,588
Whatever. But the girls still love him!

195
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:20,442
I even watched a video where a girl fainted when she got to meet him!

196
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,111
Alright, just listen to one song of his. I bet he'll grow on you, too!

197
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,936
Not interested, thank you!

198
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,872
Where's this concert? Where's Mahira gone?

199
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,219
I think Port Grand.

200
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:38,360
But how will you go?

201
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,118
Your sandals are broken.

202
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,937
I'll change.

203
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,440
Mum...

204
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,164
Would you happen to have some money?

205
00:16:47,164 --> 00:16:49,400
Let me see...

206
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,610
I've only got 500.

207
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,690
It'll do.

208
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,987
Don't worry.

209
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,700
I'm bringing Mahira <i>back</i>!

210
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:10,105
Look at her! How lovely...

211
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,612
Azan! What are you doing, mate?

212
00:17:22,815 --> 00:17:26,510
My performances aren't complete without it and you know it.

213
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,888
Enough of that.

214
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:32,260
The sponsors are clear - no messing up this performance. So, please, go back.

215
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:38,203
My dear man, I'm doing your sponsors a favour!
-The show's barely started!

216
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:39,780
You know me.

217
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,790
No melody comes out until this goes in.

218
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,520
You, too, know we're in big trouble if we mess this show up!

219
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,841
How's this -

220
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:51,447
You want the show to go well?

221
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,986
I can make this night <i>so</i> rocking

222
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,861
That it'll go down in history!

223
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,294
I can't take any risks.

224
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,331
The crowd's restless. Go back.
-Oh?

225
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,693
Let's do it this way -

226
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,728
<i>You</i> take the stage.

227
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:06,710
Satisfy yourself <i>and</i> your sponsors.

228
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,864
I'm out. Bye.

229
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:10,571
Azan!

230
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:14,462
I'll do -- something...

231
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:15,630
Okay.

232
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,796
One, two, three, four, five! Five minutes. I'll be back.

233
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,890
That's the bleedin' limit.

234
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,268
Yes!

235
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,216
Be done with it!

236
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:34,050
I'm going to get Mahira.

237
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,266
May I come too? I want to click a selfie with Azan! Please?

238
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:42,786
Shut up and stay at home. Satisfy yourself on that tablet. I'm not going there for fun.

239
00:18:42,786 --> 00:18:48,171
I'll twist her ear before everyone so she knows she can't get away with lying to you!

240
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,751
Take care, my dear...

241
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,295
Doesn't Mahira look so lovely!

242
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:58,347
Stop it already!

243
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,600
I love you!

244
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh my God! Azan!

245
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,742
What?

246
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,760
I love you!
-What?

247
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
Can I please come on the stage?

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,188
Hold on...

249
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:28,943
So she wants to come on the stage! What good will this show be...

250
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:32,102
If I turned a lady <i>so comely</i> down?

251
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:35,855
What good will my music be?

252
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:39,550
What good will all your love be?

253
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,426
Let me bring her up here.

254
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,091
Oh my God...

255
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm a huge fan of yours! Please -- Please marry me!

256
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,518
Oh... So she wants to marry me!

257
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,054
So, what's your name?

258
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,214
Mahira.

259
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,639
Well, Miss Mahira, I'll believe it

260
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,530
Only if you sung your wish out!

261

Call her outside.

307

I'll be out of this job if I let you in, ma'am.

309
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,815
Okay, when will the show be over?

310
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:01,441
By the morning.

311
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:02,955
Jeez...

312
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:08,390
I'm very worried. I rea --
-Sorry, ma'am. Please don't jump the queue. Go back.

313
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,937
Looking at the crowd, it looks like the blimming gold rush!

314
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,748
It's time, now, Miss Mahira,

315
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:18,065
You should go back to your friends.

316
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,160
Well, yeah...

317
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,894
Actually -- No.

318
00:23:21,894 --> 00:23:26,161
I love you so much! Please marry me!

319
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:28,508
This is so sweet!

320
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:31,454
Isn't it too early? We just met.

321
00:23:31,454 --> 00:23:34,379
But, I say, keep dreaming.

322
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,235
You may just get your wish!

323
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:42,010
Keep dreaming, but for now, it's time you go back to your friends.

324
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,765
But -- Just a little longer?
-No.

325
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:46,178
Please. Careful.

326
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:49,938
Be careful! Don't hurt yourself! Okay.

I'm press!

333

Which agency are you from?

334
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,245
Forget it. I need to go in.

335
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:41,301
No card, no entry.

336
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,578
I've left my card in my car.

337

So please let me in.

338
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,004
Sorry ma'am. You'll have to show your card to get in.

339
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:50,270
I'm Azan Ali Khan's guest.

340
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,115
I'll complain to <i>him</i> if you misbehaved with me.

341
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,990
And you'll be ousted if he found out!

342
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,826
Think again. I'm going in.

343
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,747
I was just doing my duty, ma'am.

344
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,930
You could've told me earlier! You're the boss' guest, which makes you my guest too!

345
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,558
You may go in.

346
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,268
Did you see that? Just as I said!
-What?

347
00:25:11,705 --> 00:25:13,210
As they say,

348
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,828
When you yearn for something with all your heart, the entire privy purse conspires in helping you achieve it!

349
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:20,348
Universe, not privy purse!

350
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:22,076
Aye, that...

351
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,947

Which song would you choose to play?

366
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:22,185
Thank you all for coming here, but there'll be no interviews today.

367
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,085
Azan's not really well.

368
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:28,250
It'll only take five minutes. We have to talk.

369
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,750
Please, it won't be possible.

370
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,361
I've heard Azan's been sued again?

371
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:34,280
The people would want to hear his side.

372
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,674
Ask me. I'm Azan's spokesperson.

373
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:42,942
Alright, tell me why he isn't saying anything about the charges against him? It's the social media age, after all!

374
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:47,951
No tweets, no videos... What do we take this to mean?

375
00:26:47,951 --> 00:26:51,296
Is it that these charges are - at least partly - true?

376
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:54,517
We don't consider every tweet worthy of a reply.

377
00:26:54,517 --> 00:27:00,120
If those speaking against Azan are so truthful...

378
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,524
They can go to court.

379
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,864
Azan's here!

380
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,521
How much more will you milk your old songs? Why don't you release a new album?

381
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:15,197
Well, as they say, old is gold...

382
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:20,800
Your songs may be old, but what do you say about the fresh accusations against you?

383
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,434
It seems, ma'am, you're more interested in the accusations than my songs and me!

384
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:30,560
In that case, what are you doing here?

385
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,697
Go to <i>them</i>.

386
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:36,041
We did. She's suing you. Why don't you say anything?

387
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,494
Is your silence a confession?

388
00:27:38,494 --> 00:27:40,851
Who do I tell the truth?

389
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,010
<i>You</i>?

390
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,433
<i>Her</i>?

391
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:46,430
Or this media who'd try me?

392
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,473
The court would try you, because Alizeh's sued you.

393
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:53,166
Why is it always you?

394
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:55,026
Why don't you respect women?

395
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:58,110
There's a new case every other day!
-You know very well, ma'am...

396
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,840
I've performed across the world -- the neighbouring countries -- You think I'd leave all the girls in the world

397
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,538
And hit on <i>her</i>,

398
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,620
And do whatever else she says?

399
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,850
Can you believe it? Just think -- Just -- Why?

400
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,120
Because you would've done <i>something</i>.

401
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,120
There's nothing. I haven't done anything.

402
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,246
If you want the truth, I'm telling you -

403
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:25,052
As long as you're chums, you're chums,

404
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:31,343
And the moment you're not, you're an enemy. But I'm happy...

405
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:33,436
The court's hearing it.

406
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,919
I'm done with the interview.

407
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,842
Thank you so much for coming.

408
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:41,627
I hope you've gotten all your answers, so please --
-Just one thing!

409
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:46,432
Have you been depressed lately over your mother's death?

410
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:52,113
I heard your mother died of something <i>other</i> than ill health...

411
00:28:53,099 --> 00:29:00,891
Do you know about it? Or are you lying even about your mother's death to save your career and fame?

412
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,822
How dare you talk about my mother, eh?

413
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:07,430
How dare you talk about my mother?
-Camera over here! Record Azan!

414
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,810
You'll pay for misbehaving with and assaulting the press!
-<i>You</i>'ll pay for what you said!

415
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,015
How dare you talk about my Mum?
-You'll pay for it!

416
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:17,700
I'll kill you right here! I'm Azan Ali Khan!

417
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,936
I won't spare you!

418
00:29:18,936 --> 00:29:22,550
I'll make you pay for misbehaving with the press.
-Leave him, Azan!

419
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:27,569
Do you hear me? I'm Azan Ali Khan!
-Record it!

420
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,988
Azan!

421
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,157
This is the last one.

422
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:32,528
No more.

423
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:35,120
And this better not affect your performance.

424
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,849
The sponsors are panicking because of the press.

425
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,996
Please, get ready quickly.

426
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,733
I'll never go back on my word.

427
00:29:50,733 --> 00:29:52,988
And forget you?

428
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:54,979
Impossible.

429
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,732
I love you, Mum.

430
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,430
Where could she be...

431
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,210
What are you -- Why are you staring at me -- like you'd eat me alive? Let go!

432
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,933
Ouch!

433
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:31,925
What was that?

434
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,098
You said, 'Let go'.

435
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,947
I just did.

436
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,570
Don't you have common sense?

437
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,646
What?

438
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:47,220
<i>You</i> broke my bottle, and instead of saying sorry, you're arguing with me!

439
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,710
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,132
It was an accident.

441
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:52,134
By the way, you don't need to yell like that.

442
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:56,329
Of all the nerve!

443
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:59,135
Why are you shouting? We were both wrong.

444
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:02,550
Besides, it's not like you were looking where you were going!
-Hey!

445
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,816
What kind of attitude is that?

446
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:06,350
Do you even know

447
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,580
Who I am?

448
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,010
I don't and I have no interest!

449
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,536
By the way, <i>you</i> don't know who you're talking to!

450
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:16,480
I'm no random Mary, Jane or Susie!

451
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,153
Hey, ma'am!

452
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:20,937
You barged into <i>my place</i>, broke <i>my</i> bottle,

453
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:24,230
And instead of saying sorry, you're acting up!

454
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,791
I get it now!

455
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:28,230
You are one of those girls

456
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,914
Who want to meet me, cling to me, and when they don't get to,

457
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:35,291
They show their ugly true faces.

458
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:39,212
Call the press. Start campaigns against me. I know that.

459
00:31:39,212 --> 00:31:40,614
Shut up!

460
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:41,509
What?

461
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,682
I said shut up!

462
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:47,421
Are you even thinking or blabbering just about anything?

463
00:31:47,421 --> 00:31:50,094
I have no such vices!

464
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:55,897
I'm just here for my sister who's mad about Azan Ali Khan,

465
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:58,837
Who's leading the youth astray!

466
00:31:58,837 --> 00:32:03,368
I'm surprised though, that there's folks like <i>you</i> here!

467
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,994
Me?

468
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:08,544
<i>I</i>'m leading the youth astray?

469
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:13,745
You idiot! I'm talking about Azan Ali Khan.

470
00:32:14,903 --> 00:32:16,950
The bottle you broke was mine,

471
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,289
But it seems <i>you</i>'re high, ma'am.

472
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,680
<i>I</i>

473
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,704
<i>I</i> am Azan Ali Khan.

474
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,233
How shameless!
-Stop it, Mum...

475
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,407
Leave it be.
-Stop it!

476
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,531
She's crossed every limit! I'll break her legs!

477
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:19,722
Sorry, Mum -- Why are you so angry?

478
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:22,709
Why shouldn't she? Did you have to lie?

479
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,397
I'll get some sense into her!
-Mum!

480
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:29,242
Stop it.
-Oh, please!

481
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:33,228
She's got no idea! My hands grow tired of weaving,

482
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:36,930
And you'd squander my money on this vileness!

483
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,594
Azan Khan had a concert in Karachi after ages, Mum...

484
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:44,548
How could I miss it?
-I'll get this Azan Ali Khan out of you!

485
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:48,203
Arguing back to her mother! The shameless lass!
-Sit down, Mum...

486
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:53,020
Your blood pressure will shoot up. Why sicken yourself? Alisha, get some water.
-Just let me die!

487
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,481
I'd rather die than see her accursed face!

488
00:33:56,481 --> 00:34:02,120
Do you have any idea at all? One sister walks 20 miles, but <i>she</i>!

489
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,420
She's wasting my hard-earned money on her decadence!

490
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,959
If only I knew that going to the concert would get me in the soup!

491
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:12,470
Look at her! As lippy as shameless!

492
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,514
Shut up, Mahira!
-Good Lord, what is happening!

493
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,688
Who's cursed us?
-Mum...

494
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,130
Mum, have some water.

495
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,553
Out of my sights!

496
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,865
Have some water.

497
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,920
Don't worry, Mum.

498
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,535
I've told her.

499
00:34:31,535 --> 00:34:32,927
She won't do it again.

500
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,607
Please... Calm down.

501
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:40,100
Alright, Mum, I'll serve dinner.

502
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:42,284
I'm not having anything.

503
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:45,393
I'm full of this wigging!

504
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,993
Good Lord, her insolence!

505
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,880
And <i>you</i> always back her, don't you?

506
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,771
Tell me,

507
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:02,710
Is he really so lovely, handsome, and good?

508
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,816
Yes, very handsome. In fact, these pictures don't show a thing!

509
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,184
So, why didn't you click a selfie with him?

510
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:14,004
I couldn't, not in that rush! Besides, my phone had died.

511
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:17,753
Either way, I wouldn't have taken this dirt cheap phone out before him.

512
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:20,466
So, did he talk to you?

513
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:24,997
Obviously, he talked to me. I even performed on the stage with him.

514
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:28,045
I wish I'd been there!

515
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,210
I would've clicked a selfie with him!

516
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,974
I'll take you along next time!

517
00:35:32,974 --> 00:35:34,890
Really?
-Yes.

518
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,042
You're so good. You can do everything.

519
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:39,993
I want to be just like you.

520
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:43,589
Your hairstyle, makeup -- Everything!

521
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:47,470
My dear, I'll make you look far prettier than me!

522
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,346
Really? You're so good!

523
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,518
Well, spoiler! No one looks pretty on an empty stomach!

524
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:59,541
And you... You'd rather starve than give up.

525
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,167
As if there's anything left.

526
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,503
I've brought dinner. Here.

527
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,637
Oh, you're just great...

528
00:36:05,637 --> 00:36:08,282
Why don't you be great too?

529
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:13,177
Look around. Be responsible. Focus on your studies.

530
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:16,987
I've studied enough. Just get me married.

531
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:18,938
What's this madness, Juliet?

532
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:20,452
Whatever have you studied?

533
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:23,469
What good will any of it be?

534
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:26,374
What'd I do with this complicated law or that one?

535
00:36:26,374 --> 00:36:31,271
The only law I understand is, 'Get me married quick'.

536
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:35,510
You haven't grown up one bit, Mahira. Your mental age is younger than Alisha's!

537
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,270
Hey --
-Well, that makes me your elder sister!

538
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,847
Oh, really!

539
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:44,239
I mean --

540
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:46,140
She's so little...
-Oh?

541
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,691
Must you be so adamant?

542
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:05,880
Present day

543
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,013
Here. Have it.

544
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,467
Why are you doing this?

545
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,272
What've I done? Let me go!

546
00:37:14,272 --> 00:37:15,827
Finish it quick!

547
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:18,459
Do you have any idea who you're talking to?

548
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:23,763
You don't know who I work with. They'll make you pay!

549
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,880
It's you, isn't it?

550
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:42,080
Another video of Azan Ali Khan has been leaked,

551
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,662
Which complicates matters for him.

552
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:50,000
Was she going to be his next victim?

553
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
