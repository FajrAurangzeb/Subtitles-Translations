1
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,856
Just two more minutes.

2
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:11,896
Still two minutes?

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,443
You're very hungry?

4
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:15,879
Very.

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:17,034
Just...

6
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:19,110
It'll be ready in a while.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,971
And Maman's here!

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,609
What's going on?

9
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,879
I'm making an omelette for Rumi.

10
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,729
Didn't he eat anything?

11
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:40,676
How could he? Nothing had been cooked.

12
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,980
Hey!

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,050
Didn't she cook food?

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,424
The maid left at 12.

15
00:00:46,424 --> 00:00:47,979
She called,

16
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:50,703
Telling that her Mum's been rushed to the hospital.

17
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:52,879
She said she had to go.

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,639
And you said, 'Go'?

19
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,842
What could I do?

20
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:58,619
Her Mum was at the hospital.

21
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:03,160
Would I have stopped her here to have her cook?

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,109
Come here,

23
00:01:04,109 --> 00:01:06,041
My sweet.

24
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,849
My son will sit here and have his omelette.

25
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,989
Maman's going to change and come, okay?

26
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,689
When did you come here?

27
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,029
I came back early.

28
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,389
So what are you doing now?

29
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,269
Preparing tea

30
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,930
For you.

31
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,620
Don't talk about him.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,790
What do you want?

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,743
In fact, what does your heart want?

34
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:20,717
He won't find out.

35
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,017
We'd board a flight at 8 a.m.,

36
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,406
And come back by the 6 p.m. flight.

37
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:26,596
Just say that

38
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:30,367
You'll be late on Monday.

39
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:46,816
Has Rumi been enrolled?
-Why didn't you inform Asim.. ? He got the booking done.. Why?

40
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,099
Yes, Mehwish?

41
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,810
When does the flight leave?

42
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,639
9 a.m.

43
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,460
And when's the return?

44
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,540
6 p.m.

45
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,479
I mean, when would we land in Karachi?

46
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,152
Around 8 p.m.

47
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,532
Okay, thank you.

48
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,770
You're welcome.

49
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,442
Bye.

50
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:13,230
Finished?

51
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,599
Well done.

52
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,739
You didn't even ask about Rumi's admission.

53
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:21,879
Ah, yes, I was about to ask that.

54
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,199
Hasn't he been admitted?

55
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,320
He has been.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,569
Alright, Rumi, show Maman your books.

57
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,467
Go... Very good.

58
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:33,379
I hope there was no problem.

59
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:35,998
There was,

60
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:40,604
But I didn't need to call anyone.

61
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:43,964
The principal was asking about you.

62
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,527
I said you couldn't get a leave.

63
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,434
Thank you.

64
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,859
Do you have a lot of work at the office?

65
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:04,209
I mean, you should've at least called to ask...

66
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,411
The principal

67
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,600
Was saying,

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,495
'Mothers are very emotional at such moments'.

69
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:13,759
I was checking my phone again and again

70
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,305
To tell the principal if you called,

71
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,230
'Here'.

72
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,009
'Look at how emotional she is'!

73
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:26,739
But I think you were busy...

74
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,644
Do you know

75
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:32,599
I've been made a secretary to the board of directors?

76
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,329
Wow...

77
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,109
You're progressing so rapidly!

78
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:39,410
So, will you be paid more, too?

79
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,079
I'll have more responsibilities.

80
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,394
Obviously...

81
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,709
I'll take charge from the old secretary tomorrow.

82
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:48,989
I may be late tomorrow.

83
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:51,085
How late?

84
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,940
I'll be back around 9 or 10.

85
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,503
It's okay... Let it be 9 or 10.

86
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,889
The tea's nice, isn't it?

87
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,099
Yes, very nice.

88
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,469
Maman, books.

89
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,937
Yes, just a minute.

90
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,790
It may even be 10 or 11, Danish.

91
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,289
So what?

92
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,799
Let 9 be 10,

93
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,549
Let 10 be 11.

94
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,639
I trust you, Mehwish.

95
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:33,569
Show your books to Maman.

96
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:38,690
Look into my eyes when you talk, Danish.

97
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,880
What is it?

98
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,593
You don't want to say what you're saying, innit?

99
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:49,770
Surely, I'm saying what you want to hear?

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,149
Know what, Mehwish,

101
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,369
I'm scared of you,

102
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:04,529
Or is it that you've frightened me?

103
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:08,439
I feel that stopping you is no good.

104
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:13,212
You won't stop now.

105
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:17,899
So, I allow you, thinking

106
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,210
That you're doing everything as I please.

107
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,079
It's okay.

108
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,631
I have no problem.

109
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:30,809
Just try to come back quickly.

110
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:35,290
Rumi and I will be waiting for you.

111
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,060
C'mon,

112
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,379
Have a look at Rumi's books.

113
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,049
I'll get

114
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,750
Some bread for breakfast.

115
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,030
Do you want anything else?

116
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,939
Get some butter and eggs.

117
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,689
We have enough.

118
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,779
He and I had finished all the bread.

119
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,810
Okay then,

120
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,649
Just get some bread.

121
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,950
And chocolates for me.

122
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,889
You just had one in the afternoon.

123
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,780
Please, Papa...

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,879
I'll get you a small one.

125
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
It'll do.

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,885
Come here.

127
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,705
Show me.

128
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,320
Wow...

129
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,309
My son will read so many books?

130
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:17,719
Yes.

131
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,920
Promise me that you will score very good marks.

132
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,872
I promise.

133
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,570
Good boy.

134
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,984
This one's very interesting...

135
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,870
Would you happen to have a matchstick, old chap?

136
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,209
Uh, yes, right here.

137
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,481
I haven't seen you smoking before.

138
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,951
I smoke one or two now and then, secretly.

139
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,980
Thanks.

140
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,269
Hello?

141
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,341
Sorry.

142
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:23,261
I was busy with my family.

143
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:25,680
I can understand.

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,271
Are you upset with me?

145
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:29,550
Not at all?

146
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,915
Why should I be upset?

147
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,120
I know

148
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,493
You've got a family,

149
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,630
A husband,

150
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,882
And a thousand issues with your husband.

151
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,960
It's okay. Fine.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,133
I know you're not okay.

153
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,806
But I have a solution.

154
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,930
Solution?

155
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:52,389
I --

156
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,230
I'll be coming with you.

157
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,710
Are you sure?

158
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:58,279
I said it.

159
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,852
But please make sure that we

160
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:02,070
Land in Karachi by 9.

161
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,119
Of course, we'd land in Karachi by 9.

162
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:05,929
So --

163
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:10,936
Don't send a car in the morning; I'll book a cab.

164
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:14,839
I don't want that the driver should know that I went to the airport from home.

165
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,840
Oh, yes, but
-Don't worry, I'll be there.

166
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,994
Okay.

167
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,560
As you say.

168
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,009
When do I get there?

169
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,663
7.30 max.

170
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:30,219
Why 7.30?

171
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:32,759
You've never travelled by air, have you?

172
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,759
No.

173
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,750
You have to be there an hour before the flight leaves.

174
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,446
It'll be very difficult then...

175
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:44,559
Danish leaves at 8.

176
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,829
Just a minute...

177
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,859
He'll leave at 7.15 tomorrow.

178
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:49,920
Rumi's school starts at 8.

179
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
That's alright --

180
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,469
I'll be there at 7.30.

181
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:57,569
Thank God.

182
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:59,249
I'll disconnect.

183
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,709
Listen...

184
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,939
Yes?

185
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:05,030
You made my day.

186
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,259
Thank you.

187
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,329
Okay, bye...

188
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,329
Bye.

189
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,120
Looking beautiful.

190
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:40,561
You rapscallion!

191
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,939
Hello?

192
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,699
Good morning, sir.

193
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,510
Good morning.

194
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,899
Wake up call, sir.

195
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,221
What time is it?

196
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,471
It's 6.25, sir.

197
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,952
I'm getting up...

198
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,939
Danish!

199
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,929
Is Rumi ready yet?

200
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,279
Quickly, Danish, it's almost 7.

201
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,369
Leave 7 be.

202
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,609
Look at your son.

203
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:59,707
See how much this school uniform suits him!

204
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:02,374
My son is so sweet!

205
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:05,190
You're so sweet, too.

206
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:10,019
He's taken after you, hasn't he?

207
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,210
Alright,

208
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,329
Quickly, now...

209
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:15,633
Good boy.

210
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,209
Bag...

211
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,139
Listen.

212
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,744
May I call you if I miss you?

213
00:14:26,744 --> 00:14:28,019
Why are you asking?

214
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,271
Call me.

215
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,230
And if I miss you a lot?

216
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,880
Call me again, then.

217
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,261
Get going already.

218
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:37,040
Just a moment...

219
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,500
Let's click a selfie.
-Selfie...

220
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,570
It's his first day of school.

221
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,341
We'll cherish the memory with this selfie. Come.

222
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,710
Move in.

223
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:54,116
There...

224
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:55,510
Hey!

225
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,396
Alright.

226
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,545
Bye, Rumi!

227
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,119
How does it feel?

228
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,230
Splendid!

229
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,071
It's my son's first day of school.

230
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,870
I'll give you a surprise gift.

231
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,879
Sure?

232
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,989
Yes.

233
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:26,320
But you'll have to promise me that you'll study hard. Ace everything.

234
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,399
I promise.

235
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,840
I can't believe it either.

236
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,990
I don't know

237
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,789
How I handled it...

238
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:40,600
Do you know how I feel?

239
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,899
What?

240
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,980
I'd see others in my teen years.

241
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,194
I never went on a date myself,

242
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:53,113
So, I never knew how delightful such dates could be.

243
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,459
Why one feels fear,

244
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,679
Why one is ecstatic...

245
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,759
How an eagerness to leave

246
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,953
Feels in an eagerness to meet...

247
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,290
Say something, will you?

248
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,089
I'm very worried.

249
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,291
Don't worry.

250
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,949
I'm right here by you.

251
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,479
We'd be back by 8, wouldn't we?

252
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,260
Of course we would be...

253
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,429
I take care of you more than you do yourself.

254
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,839
Isn't it so?

255
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,729
I know.

256
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,980
So, don't say now that you're worried.

257
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,589
I won't.

258
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:33,935
Promise?

259
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:36,309
I promise.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,300
Tea or coffee, sir?

261
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,504
I'll have some coffee.

262
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,219
In a moment.

263
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:23,602
Tea or coffee?

264
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:24,880
Tea.

265
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,659
Coming right up.

266
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,920
What is it, M. Danish?

267
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,159
Nothing.

268
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,059
I just felt a tad suffocated...

269
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,279
I think the AC's not working.

270
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,639
The AC's working alright.

271
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,380
So, how did you figure out I'm a tad suffocated?

272
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,815
Was it something on my face?

273
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,189
No.

274
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,289
It's --

275
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:32,889
Just that you stopped for a while while working.

276
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,309
Does something worry you?

277
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,029
No.

278
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,409
Not at all.

279
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:37,610
Yes...

280
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,439
It's my son's first day of school.

281
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,359
He's a bit naughty.

282
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,810
That's why I was worried...

283
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,669
All the kids are naughty, M. Danish.

284
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,049
Have your coffee, it's getting cold.

285
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,499
Ah, right...

286
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,769
It's gotten cold.

287
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,130
When kids go to school,

288
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,549
One says, 'May the Lord be with them'.

289
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,190
I said that.

290
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,860
I'd even recited a few hymns.

291
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,970
Was he crying?

292
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,279
No.

293
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,534
He was very happy.

294
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,330
Then, how say you be happy too?

295
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,119
Yes...

296
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,090
Hey!

297
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,450
Yes?

298
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,950
Please warm this coffee.

299
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,811
Alright.

300
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:18,511
And

301
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,552
Would you happen to have a pill for headache?

302
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,440
Do you have a headache?

303
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,010
Not at the moment.

304
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,810
But I feel I may have one soon.

305
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,342
Take the pill from me.

306
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:34,630
But you won't take it before you have a headache.

307
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,830
Of course.

308
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,800
Who takes one before one has a headache?

309
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,770
I'll take charge from the old secretary tomorrow.

310
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,510
I may be late tomorrow.

311
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,880
How late?

312
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,400
I'll be back around 9 or 10.

313
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,560
It's okay... Let it be 9 or 10.

314
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,580
Look into my eyes when you talk, Danish.

315
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,509
What is it?

316
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,109
You don't want to say what you're saying, innit?

317
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,200
Surely, I'm saying what you want to hear?

318
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,249
Know what, Mehwish,

319
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,419
I'm scared of you,

320
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:51,360
Or is it that you've frightened me?

321
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,989
I feel that stopping you is no good.

322
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:57,619
You won't stop now.

323
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,079
Come.

324
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,679
Have your lunch.

325
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,744
No, please,

326
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,049
Have yours,

327
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,739
I've ordered something.

328
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,919
I know, we're

329
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,599
Not exactly friends...

330
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,200
But it doesn't take long to become friends.

331
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,379
I've known you for four years, but never known that you have a friend.

332
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,283
Let's be friends.

333
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,039
A friend

334
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,030
Is more like a father in times of sorrow.

335
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,210
Besides,

336
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,099
I'm much older than you are anyhow.

337
00:21:54,099 --> 00:22:00,269
30 years ago, when I got married, I'd tell my wife that she was like a blessing.

338
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:04,931
She'd agree to everything I'd say.

339
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,029
In the beginning, I'd only tell the truth,

340
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,011
And

341
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:13,500
Later on, I started lying.

342
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,449
There's a very definite time

343
00:22:16,449 --> 00:22:20,369
In a man's life when he starts lying.

344
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,161
This is the time when

345
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:27,570
Another woman starts giving him time.

346
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,367
Then, he begins to think that the one from 30 years ago

347
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:34,219
Was no blessing.

348
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:39,321
He'd just gotten her on the pretext of a marriage, as everyone gets one.

349
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:42,519
He fights with the first one for no reason, and is upset with her,

350
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,380
He's angry without cause,

351
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:52,499
And says with a melancholy voice before the second, 'I couldn't have an understanding with her'.

352
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:54,720
This performance of lying

353
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,490
Is so realistic that the man himself begins to believe he's telling the truth,

354
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,519
And the day he believes he's telling the truth is the day

355
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,520
His household is ruined.

356
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,089
I've made this mistake.

357
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:18,950
I've destroyed my household with my own hands.

358
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,530
That's why I've come to you.

359
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,589
I haven't heard about your sorrow,

360
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:29,636
But I've seen your performance,

361
00:23:29,636 --> 00:23:35,530
And you're putting up a performance far better than I ever could.

362
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,829
I request you, mate,

363
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:47,239
Do not let your household fall to ruin,

364
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:55,459
For the stones of a ruined household rain down on the head of the one who's ruined it.

365
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,009
Have a nice day.

366
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:08,999
Listen, M. Matin,

367
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:12,309
There's no other woman in my life,

368
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:16,009
Nor am I putting up a performance of my sorrow.

369
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:19,439
I love my wife very much.

370
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:25,720
So much that I never felt the need for any friend.

371
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,749
I swear

372
00:24:27,749 --> 00:24:31,110
I'm not like you.

373
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,280
C'mon.

374
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,409
Hey! Papa's come back before me!

375
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,120
Papa!

376
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,382
Papa!

377
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,470
Papa!

378
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,371
I'm hungry.

379
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:47,733
Hungry?

380
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:48,559
Come.

381
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,400
I'll cook you something.

382
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,030
C'mon, sweet little one.

383
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,864
Very good. Right here.

384
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,560
How could it have been cancelled?

385
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:15,229
Are you alright?

386
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,582
Okay, let's see.

387
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,259
Alright.

388
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,141
We're headed for the airport.

389
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:22,130
Okay.

390
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,669
Bye.

391
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:26,311
What is it?

392
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,839
We have to go.

393
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,420
What happened?

394
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,539
God...

395
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:35,170
What is it?

396
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,814
Could anyone have thought it'd suddenly rain, and like this!

397
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:43,279
Whether it rains like this or that, just tell me what's happened.

398
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
The flight's been cancelled.

399
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,509
What?

400
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:50,309
But we're going to the airport; we'd board any flight that's available.

401
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,869
Don't worry.

402
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:57,013
Just let this rain stop; we'll be in Karachi by 8.

403
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,442
Why are you afraid?

404
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:07,860
He'd kill me!

405
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,169
Who'd kill you?

406
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,953
I'm right here.

407
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:13,399
I won't let anyone touch you.

408
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,470
I'd break his hands.

409
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:19,621
Alright, now,

410
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:20,509
Get ready.

411
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:22,699
We're off to the airport.

412
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:24,859
This number is switched off. Please try again later.

413
00:28:36,002 --> 00:28:42,829
This number is switched off. Please try again later.

414
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,639
Hello?

415
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,610
Hello.

416
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,230
Is this M. Shehwar's residence?

417
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,519
Yes.

418
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,229
May I talk to him? I'm a friend.

419
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,720
Uh, Monsieur's gone to Islamabad.

420
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,152
When?

421
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:49,609
He took the 9 a.m. flight.

422
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:52,900
When would he be back?
-Sir,

423
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,539
He'd be back tonight.

424
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,369
He'd be on his way right now.

425
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:59,379
His flight's been delayed because of the rain,

426
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:02,079
So it'll land at 10.30 now.

427
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,010
Who are you?

428
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,639
I'm a friend.

429
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,460
Alright.

430
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,470
Stop the bike.

431
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,066
Shall we talk here?

432
00:32:27,066 --> 00:32:29,306
About what?

433
00:32:30,766 --> 00:32:33,746
Would you beat me when we get back?

434
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,926
Why?

435
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:41,016
I went to Islamabad...

436
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:43,566
You'd gone there on a business trip, hadn't you?

437
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,676
Yes.

438
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:48,746
What's the problem then?

439
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:52,918
I hadn't told you.

440
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:54,996
My fault.

441
00:32:54,996 --> 00:32:58,766
My words had scared you.

442
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:03,149
I'm a tad possessive, innit?

443
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,513
So, I say some things that I shouldn't really say.

444
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:09,419
Obviously, you'd be afraid...

445
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,720
One lies when one's afraid.

446
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,260
A wife does, 100%.

447
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,352
I'll apologise to you when we get back.

448
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:23,509
And please, have no fear.

449
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,489
Just let me know if you're going to Islamabad.

450
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:28,709
No problem.

451
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,540
Shall we get going?

452
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,100
Go.

453
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,000
Go.
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

454
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,909
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

455
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,590
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

456
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,980
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

457
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,710
<i>What does it matter, if I don't have</i>

458
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,179
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

459
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:01,010
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

460
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:06,349
<i>That I had you;</i>

461
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:09,179
<i>But, from you, I have learnt</i>

462
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,910
<i>That, even in love,</i>

463
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,679
<i>One could rather betray,</i>

464
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,830
<i>One could rather repulse.</i>

465
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,600
Go; I'll follow with Rumi.

466
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,610
Rumi!

467
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,509
Rumi!
-I won't talk to you, you left me.

468
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:50,255
I'd gone to pick Maman up; I'm so sorry.

469
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,939
Do you know I was crying?

470
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:55,689
My dear son...
-Hearing him crying, I brought little Rumi down here.

471
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:56,879
Thank you so much.

472
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,749
No, sir,

473
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:59,580
There's no need to thank me.

474
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,114
Park my bike and keep the keys with you; I'll take them in the morning.

475
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:06,720
Thank you, Guard Uncle.
-God bless you.

476
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:01,207
Did you eat anything?

477
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,700
Didn't the maid cook anything?

478
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,179
She would've; I didn't take a look.

479
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,852
Alright, I'll get you some bread; you should have something.

480
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:16,684
No.

481
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,270
You're angry?

482
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,740
Yes.

483
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,190
I'm sorry.

484
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,399
It's okay, Mehwish.

485
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,399
A --

486
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:45,799
Foreign delegation had come.

487
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,635
When Shehwar asked me to come,

488
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:51,729
I thought it'd be a good experience for me.

489
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,396
Shall we sleep?

490
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:57,589
First, fix your mood.

491
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,609
What should I do? Laugh?

492
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:01,569
No...

493
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:07,189
Just smile in a way that feels like you're actually smiling.

494
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:10,389
Did you eat anything?

495
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:11,600
Yes,

496
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,300
On the flight.

497
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,599
You must've travelled business class.

498
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,586
Yes.

499
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,261
Mind if I ask something?

500
00:37:32,261 --> 00:37:34,450
Not at all.

501
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,359
Didn't you think of how much I love you?

502
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,460
Oh, please leave that be.

503
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,399
When I said 'sorry', it means I made a mistake.

504
00:37:56,344 --> 00:38:01,232
Tomorrow onwards, you're not going to the office.

505
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:04,669
I'll manage everything.

506
00:38:04,669 --> 00:38:07,151
How?

507
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,679
I'll take bribes.

508
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,294
I'll get you hundreds of thousands of Rupees a month if you want,

509
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:17,970
But you won't go to the office.

510
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,500
Good morning, sir!
-'Morning.

511
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:49,710
