1
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:23,167
M. Munir's given me.

2
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,774
Who's M. Munir?

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,640
He's a known contractor.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,842
He said he's hiring me

5
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,876
For a new job.

6
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:33,468
This is the signing amount.

7
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,012
A million...

8
00:00:35,012 --> 00:00:38,907
So we'd be riding our car tomorrow.
-He was lying, Mehwish.

9
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,811
This is a bribe.

10
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:45,017
In return for this, I have to write 'Okay' and sign every right and wrong he does.

11
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:47,233
Just do it! What's it to your father?

12
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,706
It's everything to my father, Mehwish.

13
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:53,088
Dad would think I've smirched his grave.

14
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:57,814
Dad's dead, Danish; he won't feel a thing if you smirch or bomb his grave.
-Watch what you're saying!

15
00:00:57,814 --> 00:01:00,125
Alright, why have you brought the money, then?

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,007
Do you want to show it off or tempt me?

17
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,437
I'd brought this to check my integrity.

18
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:09,126
M. Munir thinks

19
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:11,264
My intentions would change

20
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:13,983
If only I kept this money with me for two days.

21
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:16,597
But I'm afraid, Mehwish,

22
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:18,649
If I kept so much money at home,

23
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:20,656
How would I sleep?
-Alright, then.

24
00:01:20,656 --> 00:01:21,928
Stay awake.

25
00:01:21,928 --> 00:01:24,086
Listen, will you? Why --

26
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,504
Why are you so furious?

27
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,125
You're not returning this money, Danish.

28
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,911
Thank the Lord if He's been merciful on us.

29
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:34,611
Keep this in the cupboard and go to sleep.

30
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,180
And take a bribe?
-It's not a bribe, Danish!

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,678
It's a reward for your hard work and integrity.

32
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:42,204
How hard you work,

33
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:45,179
Running around on that old bike of yours,

34
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,125
Only to hear a load of guff from one like Monty!

35
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:53,768
Do you remember that your bike didn't even start the other day?

36
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:57,554
Rumi's four now and he hasn't started school yet.

37
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,491
If we save something for his admission,

38
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:02,973
It gets spent quickly for one reason or another.

39
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,490
You have just 3 or 4 pairs of trousers,

40
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,924
And some 4 or 6 shirts.

41
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:12,756
I'm thinking of what you'd wear when we'd go to dinner tomorrow.

42
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,480
Show it to me for once.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,894
What?

44
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:21,317
The one million.

45
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,538
Here.

46
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,836
I can't believe it, Danish...

47
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,630
I can't believe it either, Mehwish.

48
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,461
My head's spinning around...

49
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,620
Why don't you take a nap?

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,911
Relax, Danish.

51
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,053
No, I'm --

52
00:02:57,053 --> 00:02:58,911
I'm not sleepy.

53
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:02,233
You're still struggling over Dad, aren't you?
-No.

54
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:05,676
I'm trying to forget Dad.

55
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,901
Dad's dead.

56
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,068
So,

57
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,239
It's over now, innit?

58
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,177
May he be happy wherever he is.

59
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:19,175
One can't run a household on this trifle of a salary.

60
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,550
I'll wash my face and hands.

61
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:28,147
Dad hasn't the foggiest that petrol now costs 110 Rupees a litre;

62
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:30,499
Rumi's fees add up to 10,000;

63
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:31,507
And

64
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:34,502
A picnic on Sunday drains out every penny one's saved.

65
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,228
When buying a burger, I ask,

66
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:38,866
'Which one's the cheapest'?

67
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,304
If he showed up in my dream, I'd say to him,

68
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:56,617
'If one can't even fulfil such piffling dreams, it feels as if one's been kicked from behind',

69
00:03:56,617 --> 00:04:01,085
'Which is why I'm sorry, Dad'...

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,105
Rumi's sleeping now.

71
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,705
Do you feel like sleeping?

72
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,803
Not at all.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,051
Are you thinking about something?

74
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,099
Yes...

75
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:38,004
Don't think anything about the money.

76
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:39,807
No, I'm

77
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,006
Just thinking about this cupboard.

78
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,506
Look at this.

79
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,533
It isn't really strong.

80
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,793
It'd break the moment one would hit it.

81
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,949
Who'd hit it?

82
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:58,003
A thief.

83
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:59,344
Right...

84
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,573
So you're worrying about a thief now.

85
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:05,230
One does worry.

86
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,472
Did you check the door?

87
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:08,870
Which door?

88
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,465
The door to our house, of course!

89
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:15,684
I've checked it carefully and locked it.

90
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,901
Good.

91
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:23,297
What'd you wear tomorrow?

92
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:30,202
Why have you gotten up?

93
00:05:30,202 --> 00:05:31,652
Let's sit and talk.

94
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,372
I'm not sleepy.

95
00:05:33,372 --> 00:05:35,168
Won't you go to the office?

96
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,715
Why not?

97
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,646
And how would you get up on time if you stay awake?

98
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,569
I won't stay awake that late.

99
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:44,119
I've been trying to get to believe ever since

100
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,896
That the million is mine.

101
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,115
I can't believe it,

102
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,526
Which is why I can't sleep either.

103
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:52,149
Believe it, Danish.

104
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,197
This million's all yours.

105
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:56,808
It's the signing amount for your job,

106
00:05:56,808 --> 00:06:01,553
And nobody can take this money away from you.

107
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:05,336
So, what would you be wearing tomorrow?

108
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:08,836
Dark blue pants with a light blue shirt.

109
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:10,683
But you wore the same

110
00:06:10,683 --> 00:06:13,197
To Anoushay's brother's wedding.

111
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:15,176
Yes, and I wore a coat over it then.

112
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:17,696
I won't, this time.
-No way.

113
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:20,278
You'd go and buy clothes for yourself tomorrow.

114
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:22,275
What's the problem now, Danish?

115
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:27,111
It won't make any difference even if you spend 30 to 40 thousand.

116
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,006
Alright...

117
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:32,407
There, now! The delight of getting the money had me forget my blouse entirely!

118
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:35,128
Get it on your way back from the office tomorrow.

119
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,223
I will.

120
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:40,546
Are you feeling sleepy?

121
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:42,858
It seems so.

122
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,202
Won't you buy a car?

123
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,851
That's what I'm thinking.

124
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,061
Why don't you talk to Monty?

125
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:01,890
Why Monty?

126
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,608
He can give you on credit if you don't have the money.

127
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,548
Didn't he say so?

128
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:09,080
I'd rather not see his face again.

129
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,829
Don't you remember how we had a fist fight?

130
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,343
That was your mistake.

131
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:16,817
You created such a scene over a trifle.

132
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:22,608
You didn't even think that my name would come up in such a quarrel!

133
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,405
Yes, I didn't think of that...

134
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:30,207
He said I'm like his sister-in-law...

135
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:32,759
So, I got in the car with him.

136
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,438
He was behaving so decently it didn't even feel like he was an outsider.

137
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,959
He wouldn't have retired yet.

138
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,459
Go and meet him,

139
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,585
Talk to him.

140
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:47,385
See if he was telling the truth,

141
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,210
Or just making things up.

142
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,554
Right now?

143
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:54,493
Yes.

144
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,069
Look at the time.

145
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,420
It's 12.

146
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,586
So what if it's 12?

147
00:07:58,586 --> 00:07:59,792
Go and check,

148
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:02,475
He'd be awake.

149
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,104
Come with me.

150
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,535
What would I do there?

151
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,396
Who's asking you to go there?

152
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:15,787
Just come up to the door,

153
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,107
And when I've gone out, close the door properly.

154
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,066
Sure.

155
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:25,838
Don't go to sleep.

156
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,944
What are you saying, Danish; would I feel like sleeping like this?

157
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:30,167
Also,

158
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,647
If I knock,

159
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,022
Ask who it is.

160
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:38,321
I will. Now, go quickly and tell me he's agreed to it.

161
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,624
Lock the door from inside.

162
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:25,466
Where to?

163
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,524
How's your car?

164
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,161
Get to the point.

165
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,389
I am at the point.

166
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,131
Get this key out of your finger and put it in mine.

167
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:35,119
Why?

168
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,833
Does your Dad own it?

169
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,127
I mean

170
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,896
Sell your car.

171
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,696
And who'd buy it?

172
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:43,368
I would.

173
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,227
You would?

174
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,813
You can't believe it, can you?

175
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:49,883
Tell me how much for the car.

176
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,217
1.2 million.

177
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,917
Take 9 in cash,

178
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:57,748
And the remaining 300,000 a month later.

179
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,804
9, as in,

180
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:01,930
900,000 Rupees?

181
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,550
I'm talking about 900,000 too.

182
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,926
That's great...

183
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,470
You've run into 900,000 in one shot.

184
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,056
Where from, Monsieur?

185
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,737
What's it to you?

186
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:14,894
Look, Danish,

187
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,536
Don't surprise me like that.

188
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,504
Be honest and say you're kidding.

189
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:21,674
Or tell me if Madame's started working.

190
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,377
Don't even mention her name, you blighter!
-When did I name her?

191
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:26,190
I was just mentioning her.

192
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,581
Move away, now.

193
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:28,885
Away, as in?

194
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:32,129
I'm not buying the car from you.
-I'm not selling it to you.

195
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:34,239
But if Madame's sent you,

196
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,726
Please, buy it.

197
00:10:35,726 --> 00:10:36,940
Even if for 3 now,

198
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,069
And 9 a month later.

199
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,461
If you so much as mentioned her name,

200
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:47,414
I'd bury you alive right here!
-Get off!

201
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,532
Who is it?
-It's me.

202
00:10:57,164 --> 00:10:58,319
Didn't he agree?

203
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,755
I didn't agree. The bugger was up to a load of guff.

204
00:11:02,755 --> 00:11:04,694
He said, 'Wherever did you get so much money'?

205
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,571
'Has Madame started working'?

206
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,837
He must be angry at getting beaten.

207
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,411
You'd given him a right beating too.

208
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,946
I gave him a beating?

209
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:16,272
Would you look at what you're saying!

210
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,679
The bruise on my cheek.

211
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,801
Do you know,

212
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,553
The bugger had punched me right here.

213
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,786
There, now!

214
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:31,724
You've forgotten to lock the door.

215
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,030
What is it?
-You...

216
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,595
Were a tad angry last night,

217
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:05,314
So, what it is --
-What is it?

218
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:08,098
Hey! Won't you be buying the car?

219
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:09,345
Begone!

220
00:13:09,345 --> 00:13:10,675
Get lost!

221
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:11,834
'Begone'?

222
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,361
I told you, I'm not buying it from you.

223
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,137
Madame, are you listening?

224
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,003
I told you not to mention her!

225
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,906
I'll complain about you when I meet her.

226
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:24,563
I'll tell her this deal didn't go forward because of you.
-Get going.

227
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:51,944
Who was it?

228
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,552
It was an alarm, not a call.

229
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,642
So you'd set an alarm for 8.30?

230
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,874
Yes.

231
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:01,630
You normally set one for 7.

232
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,781
And see, now,

233
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:04,875
I'm late for the office.

234
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,427
It was necessary that you be late today.

235
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:10,157
It's not like the world has ended.

236
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:13,297
But why was it necessary that I be late?

237
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:15,924
Banks open at 9 a.m., right?

238
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,739
So they do. So?

239
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,572
What's with the bank?
-Hey!

240
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,936
Would you leave the money at home?

241
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:25,575
Deposit it in your account.

242
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,196
Ah, right...

243
00:15:01,237 --> 00:15:02,290
Yes, sir?

244
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,600
Where are you, Monsieur?

245
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,145
It's 9.15 already,

246
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:07,565
And you're not at the office yet.

247
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:08,776
Sorry, sir,

248
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,977
But I made a mistake when setting the alarm today,

249
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,146
So I've gotten up a bit late.

250
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,132
I'll be there in half an hour, sir.

251
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:16,564
Take an hour

252
00:15:16,564 --> 00:15:18,113
If you will,

253
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:22,082
But sign M. Munir's file the moment you get here.

254
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,493
Which file, sir?

255
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:25,771
Just sign whichever file

256
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,402
The peon gives you.

257
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:28,662
Full stop.

258
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,957
Sorry sir, but what is that file about?

259
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:33,458
You know the Ghalib Circle Road, my good man?

260
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,042
It's a completion certificate for it.

261
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,942
But I'm standing on the same road, sir.

262
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:41,229
Should I have the file sent there?
-No, sir.

263
00:15:41,229 --> 00:15:43,603
I'm saying that the road hasn't been built at all.

264
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:46,288
There's a pit right here by my feet.

265
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:48,085
The work hasn't even started.

266
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you saying, M. Danish?

267
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,628
What would've happened had the road been built?

268
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:56,424
What would have happened?
-It would've gotten damaged again, M. Danish!

269
00:15:56,424 --> 00:16:00,176
M. Munir's said he'd actually have the road built

270
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,768
If he got the contract the next time.

271
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:03,769
Sir?

272
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,116
You'd be here by 10, wouldn't you?

273
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:08,997
Yes, sir.
-Alright.

274
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,022
I'm in my office until 10.

275
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,299
I have to attend a meeting after that.

276
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,581
Right, sir.

277
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,427
Okay.

278
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,949
The thing is,

279
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,540
Rumi starts playing games on the phone once he's up.

280
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,401
He might've disconnected...

281
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:39,063
When did you call?

282
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:41,752
I think at 8.30.

283
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,580
M. Danish leaves by 7.45, doesn't he?

284
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,519
Yes, but he left at 9 today.

285
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,159
He -- got up a bit late today.

286
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,255
Oh!

287
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:53,471
So what do you do at home?

288
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,119
I mean,

289
00:16:55,119 --> 00:16:58,216
I wonder what you must do!

290
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:02,893
Nothing really... Attending to Rumi, household chores...

291
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:05,883
So haven't you hired a maid for Rumi?

292
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:09,219
And you do the chores yourself?

293
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:13,344
I won't now; I'm thinking of hiring a maid.

294
00:17:13,344 --> 00:17:15,956
M. Danish must've been angry to hear about it.

295
00:17:15,956 --> 00:17:17,793
About what?

296
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:21,480
That I call and talk to you.

297
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,560
But I request you

298
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,465
To not ask me to not call you

299
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:37,949
Even if he gets angry over it.

300
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,739
I swear, my intentions aren't bad.

301
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,385
Your voice is sweet,

302
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,565
And face lovely...

303
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,525
So I delight myself for a few moments

304
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,193
By hearing your voice,

305
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:54,480
Or seeing your face...

306
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,207
Just think as if I forget for a few moments everything that had happened to me...

307
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:02,971
What'd happened to you?

308
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,805
There!

309
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,662
It fell from your mouth, didn't it?

310
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:09,910
But I'm sorry, I don't like sympathies.

311
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,525
Please, tell me what had happened.

312
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,790
We'll be meeting at 9 p.m. tonight.

313
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:32,466
I won't sign

314
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:35,435
This completion certificate, sir.

315
00:18:35,435 --> 00:18:37,000
And

316
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,593
I'll manage with this job, too.

317
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,800
Come here.

318
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:49,567
Keep this money in the cupboard.

319
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,506
May I leave now, sir?

320
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:56,725
Okay.

321
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:04,257
And

322
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:07,972
I'm really proud of you.

323
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:10,991
Thank you, sir.

324
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:22,622
Come here, Rumi!

325
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,340
Come here, now!

326
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:26,627
Watch your cartoons!

327
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,954
C'mon, put on this shirt.

328
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,570
Pay attention here!

329
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:37,951
Alright, sit here.

330
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:42,889
Hello?

331
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:45,606
I often wish that I hear your 'hello',

332
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,268
And disconnect the call.

333
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,218
Why?

334
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,951
That's enough for me,

335
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:54,063
Or perhaps I don't deserve any more.

336
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:56,187
May I ask you something?

337
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:57,905
Yes?

338
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,659
Does he know, too, that you're so lovely,

339
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,951
Or does he just think of you as a wife he's got?

340
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:06,186
No, he knows, too.

341
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:10,076
He says I'm -- very lovely.

342
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:12,673
Alright,

343
00:20:12,673 --> 00:20:14,529
You were telling me something and stopped...

344
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,453
And disconnected the call, too.

345
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:17,779
Please, go on,

346
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,670
What had happened to you?

347
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,833
I'll tell you at dinner.

348
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,255
No, tell me over the phone.

349
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,700
Danish would be there at dinner, too.

350
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,421
Who knows how he may feel about it?

351
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:31,628
He won't be anywhere nearby then.

352
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,219
You'd be wrong to think that.

353
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,999
He won't leave me alone with you.

354
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:39,549
Leave that to me.

355
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,804
I think he's here.

356
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:45,256
Please,

357
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:47,180
Don't hire a taxi,

358
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,023
I'll send a car over at 8.30.

359
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:51,084
Okay, bye.

360
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,411
Bye.

361
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:01,682
Hey!

362
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:04,272
You're back so early!

363
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:06,395
It's nothing, really.

364
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:09,206
I felt as if everyone in the office was staring at me.

365
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:11,206
Here's your blouse.

366
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,583
Won't you give Papa a hug?

367
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:20,275
Papa, I'm busy at the moment, I'll give you a hug later.

368
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,881
How would we get there?

369
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:27,285
We'll hire a cab, of course.

370
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,680
But what would I wear?

371
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,739
Didn't you get anything for yourself?

372
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,164
You're splendid, Danish.

373
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:35,190
I'd told you to spend some 30 - 40 thousand on yourself as you left.

374
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,288
I'd have spent some 30 - 40 thousand if I had so much money.

375
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:40,926
What do you mean?

376
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:46,265
I returned the 1 million, Mehwish.

377
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,641
What?

378
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,992
L -- Listen to me.

379
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:06,590
In exchange for it, he asked for the completion certificate of a road that's not been built so far!

380
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,254
If I worked for him,

381
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:12,927
Who knows how many such certificates I'd have had to sign!

382
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:14,722
Look,

383
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,356
I won't do that, Mehwish.

384
00:22:17,356 --> 00:22:19,275
I can't do that.

385
00:22:19,275 --> 00:22:20,396
I'll eat little,

386
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:22,261
Starve myself,

387
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:26,474
But never live off the flesh of others.

388
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:30,363
Whatever is it that I lack?

389
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:33,612
I get a salary to make do with,

390
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,146
I have a nice little flat,

391
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,632
I have such a sweet son,

392
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:41,558
My world is as I wished it to be; You're there.

393
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,936
And it's enough for me that you're there.

394
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:53,379
I've ironed your black trousers and shirt.

395
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:55,976
It's very old...

396
00:22:57,651 --> 00:22:58,527
No,

397
00:22:58,527 --> 00:22:59,359
It's fine --

398
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,153
It isn't that old...

399
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:08,983
He's taken a proper beating!
-I've not taken a beating, mate.

400
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,514
She's just a tad angry with me.

401
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:15,181
I'm not talking about you. My horse has taken a proper beating.

402
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:16,931
Oh...

403
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:37,915
Where's flat number 308, my dear fellow?

404
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,177
M. Danish's?
-Yes.

405
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:40,649
Climb up the stairs here.

406
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,431
M. Danish lives on the third floor.

407
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,428
Thank you.

408
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,927
So, how do I look?

409
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,563
It's 8.30 and the cab's not here yet...

410
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,238
There he is!

411
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:34,238
Your car's here, sir.

412
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:34,905
Right...

413
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:38,179
We'll be there in two minutes.
-Okay, sir.

414
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,093
You look right bonny, mate.

415
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,983
Not bonny; batty -- Maman looks right batty!

416
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:58,824
Hey!

417
00:24:58,824 --> 00:25:00,367
Who taught you that one?

418
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:02,262
Hold on, mate, I taught him this one.

419
00:25:02,262 --> 00:25:06,980
Seeing you at the wedding the other day, it slipped from my mouth.

420
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:12,672
Is the car here?

421
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:13,678
Yes. C'mon.

422
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,094
C'mon, Rumi. Here.
-Come.

423
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:18,326
Are you angry with me?

424
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:20,152
I'm not angry.

425
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,273
Turn off the lights.

426
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,494
Come, Rumi.

427
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:36,174
I knew it wasn't a cab the moment I saw

428
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:38,289
Such a big car.

429
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,192
Danish,

430
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,027
Quiet.

431
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,331
Hey!

432
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:45,034
What about the cab driver?

433
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:47,990
He'd keep looking for us.

434
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,505
Danish, please...

435
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:51,806
Oh...

436
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:55,518
I forgot my purse in the pocket of the trousers I wore to the office.
-So?

437
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,511
Won't there be any problem?

438
00:25:57,511 --> 00:26:00,108
We could've brought flowers for him.

439
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,747
What'd he do with our flowers?

440
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:05,154
I think it's okay.

441
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,621
There!

442
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,739
What does one do with flowers?

443
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:12,042
One just brings along some as a formality.

444
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,168
You have some money with you, right?

445
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,511
Yes?

446
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:18,980
Then, what's the problem?

447
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,749
Please, stop over at a bouquet shop around here.

448
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:23,310
I mean, a flower shop.

449
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,268
Yes, I understand.

450
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:26,857
Wow...

451
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:31,027
It seems you've earned a BA too.
-I have.

452
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:48,532
Hello, M. Danish!

453
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:51,856
You've honoured me with your presence.

454
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:53,935
Hi, Mme Danish,

455
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,732
You're looking gorgeous.

456
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,879
Flowers for you.
-Oh!

457
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,155
Thank you!

458
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,405
And M. Rumi,

459
00:28:02,405 --> 00:28:05,313
You look the sweetest of them all!

460
00:28:05,313 --> 00:28:06,378
How are you?

461
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,906
I'm fine.

462
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:10,594
Come. Please, come.

463
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,350
Please, sit.

464
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:26,916
I hope the driver got there on time?

465
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:28,322
Yes, he did.

466
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:29,405
So,

467
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,703
What'd you like to have?

468
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:34,597
Whiskey, or something else?

469
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:35,611
No,

470
00:28:35,611 --> 00:28:37,954
I -- I don't drink.

471
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:40,380
I knew it.

472
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,579
Some people's days of drinking begin a bit late.

473
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,343
Where's your wife?

474
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:50,936
It's not necessary that every man be with his wife.

475
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:52,815
I have everything, so to speak,

476
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:56,772
But I don't have my wife with me.

477
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:01,800
So you've not gotten married yet?

478
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,645
When did I say that?

479
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:05,845
I did get married.

480
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:09,394
Oh -- so, you had a break-up?

481
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,201
I'm sorry, but

482
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:15,246
What would you call a 'break-up'?

483
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:18,633
I think I asked the wrong question, I'm sor --
-No.

484
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,733
You didn't ask the wrong question.

485
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:23,181
You asked just what was right.

486
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:27,044
You just don't know what a 'break-up' is.

487
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:29,439
To not get bound in ties,

488
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,853
Or for ties to sever is no break-up.

489
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:35,431
The break-up of hearts that never get to meet

490
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:39,138
Is actually the real 'break-up'.

491
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,478
People drag on together,

492
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:45,962
But they're never together.

493
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:50,584
Let's talk about something else, shall we?

494
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:52,588
Really, I --

495
00:29:52,588 --> 00:29:54,274
I'm such a fool.

496
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,023
I was about to drown

497
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:59,179
This beautiful night in my sorrow.

498
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,213
But do you know, I believe

499
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,603
That if someone leaves you after two steps together,

500
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:07,097
You should thank that person.

501
00:30:07,513 --> 00:30:11,927
That poor soul actually saves you from a long and arduous journey.

502
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:15,023
So, whenever I talk to my wife,

503
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:17,665
I say 'thank you' to her.

504
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:19,555
'Thank you, Maham',

505
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:22,663
'Thank you so much'.

506
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:37,063
I love to have pet dogs,

507
00:30:37,063 --> 00:30:41,159
But I despise their barking.

508
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,250
Was yours a love marriage?

509
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,109
Yes.

510
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,547
Hey, M. Rumi!

511
00:30:47,547 --> 00:30:50,022
Surely, you aren't bored?

512
00:30:51,065 --> 00:30:53,032
M. Diwan!

513
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:55,393
M. Diwan!

514
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:59,047
Take M. Rumi along; have him ride the swing in the lawn,

515
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:01,569
And show him his favourite movie in the theatre room.

516
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,121
There's a theatre here, too?

517
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:04,425
Yes.

518
00:31:04,425 --> 00:31:07,704
You'd feel as if you're sitting in a cinema!

519
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:09,171
Papa, may I go?

520
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,368
Sure, go.

521
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,720
Get going, mate!

522
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:22,957
So, where did you first meet?

523
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:24,330
At the wedding?

524
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,581
No...

525
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:28,756
Where did the two of you first meet?
-Oh!

526
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:32,015
We studied together at the university.

527
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,425
Oh.

528
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:37,581
Who said 'I love you' first?
-I did.

529
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:38,871
As usual...

530
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:40,387
And

531
00:31:40,387 --> 00:31:43,782
When did you get the reply from her?

532
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,610
15 minutes later?

533
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,988
15 minutes later!

534
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,247
It's a tad long, innit?

535
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,435
When did you get married?

536
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:53,887
A year later.

537
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,098
Wow.

538
00:31:55,098 --> 00:31:57,348
That's rather quick.

539
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,090
I must say you're both very lucky.

540
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,514
I'm the luckier one, M. Shehwar,

541
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:04,203
She's completed me.

542
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:06,296
I thought, 'I don't need anything else'

543
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:10,283
'When I've got her'.

544
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,163
Please don't mind it,

545
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:20,523
For I'll only speak the truth -

546
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,334
Whoever would've gotten her

547
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,222
Would've said the same.

548
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:27,722
'I don't need anything else'.

549
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,311
May I see your theatre room too?

550
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,807
Yeah, sure.

551
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:38,202
Why not? Come, I'll show you.

552
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,201
Come, Mme Danish.

553
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,761
Goodness, mate!

554
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,853
M. Danish,

555
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,104
Please allow me to

556
00:32:50,104 --> 00:32:52,857
To drop her outside my theatre room.
-Yes, sure.

557
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:54,811
Of course...

558
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,750
Come.

559
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:31,771
Just a minute.

560
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:32,959
Right,

561
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,879
So what did I say?

562
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,247
Yes...

563
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,711
I'd said,

564
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,882
'Please don't mind, M. Danish',

565
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:42,347
'But honestly, whoever would've gotten her'

566
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,185
'Would've said the same -'

567
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:47,942
'"I don't need anything else".'

568
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:51,598
Tell me,

569
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:54,529
Did I lie?

570
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:59,210
I don't know.

571
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,637
Well, then,

572
00:34:02,637 --> 00:34:03,592
Alright.

573
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:05,402
Fine.

574
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:08,248
Call your husband,

575
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:12,485
And ask him to take everything that I have,

576
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:17,485
And give me his Mehwish.

577
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:31,803
Dad used to say,

578
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,715
'You serve one good food'

579
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:36,333
'To win one's heart'.

580
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:39,085
So, tell me, M. Danish,

581
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:42,773
Have I been able to win your heart?

582
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,740
Do you usually talk so little,

583
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,992
Or am I speaking too much?

584
00:34:48,992 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm listening.

585
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,897
I'm looking at the confidence in a man's tone

586
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:57,352
When he's successful.

587
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,430
You've been successful, Monsieur.

588
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,773
That's what I think.

589
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:03,052
To get whatever you want

590
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:05,853
Is not to be successful.

591
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,271
To get the one you like

592
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:12,366
Is success like no other.

593
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,648
Hey!

594
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,961
Serve some soup to the good man.

595
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:23,962
Try some of this soup.

596
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:30,088
Hey!
-Papa!

597
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,310
What's this?

598
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,981
Couldn't you pour it carefully?

599
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,190
M. Diwan!

600
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,114
Danish,

601
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:36,551
You're alright, aren't you?

602
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,114
Please, take him to my room,

603
00:35:38,114 --> 00:35:40,727
And give him a shirt from my wardrobe.

604
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:41,991
And stay with him.

605
00:35:41,991 --> 00:35:44,082
He might need something.

606
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:47,496
Please, don't come downstairs.

607
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:57,880
You --

608
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,333
Just got worried so suddenly.

609
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,604
He'll be fine.

610
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:02,880
It'll take just about 15 minutes for him to be back.

611
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,664
Please, sit.

612
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,633
Sit.

613
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,130
He'd ask me why I didn't go with him.

614
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,811
Just tell him, then,

615
00:36:11,811 --> 00:36:17,398
'I would rather not go into another man's bedroom'.

616
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:30,952
Everything happens as you wish.

617
00:36:31,762 --> 00:36:35,634
I wish that he not come down all night,

618
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:39,199
But this won't happen.

619
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:46,079
How many years has it been since your marriage?

620
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,539
8 years.
-Oh.

621
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,977
That's enough.

622
00:36:52,027 --> 00:36:54,167
What do you mean, 'enough'?

623
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,947
It's enough

624
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,189
For a comely girl like you to give a pleb

625
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:02,075
8 long years of her life.

626
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:08,348
You're feeling bad about it?

627
00:37:09,471 --> 00:37:11,430
Yes.

628
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,273
What do you like?

629
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,520
To live in pieces?

630
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,176
To live, entrapped by a man

631
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:21,914
Who's caught you like a hunter?

632
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:26,253
He loves me so much.
-Tell me, also, if he deserves your love.

633
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:30,302
Or if he deserves you.

634
00:37:31,137 --> 00:37:32,930
Look, M. Shehwar,

635
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,318
I like to talk to you,

636
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:40,442
But I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about these things.

637
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,851
Okay, sorry.

638
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:46,303
I'll not say it again.

639
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,564
Where's your wife?

640
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,017
Who knows where she'd be!

641
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:59,609
Perhaps in New York, perhaps in Toronto...

642
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:01,457
She'd be somewhere.

643
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:03,845
She tells me when she calls.

644
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,187
What do you talk about?

645
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:07,971
About the business, about the profit...

646
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:10,158
Or, she gets angry

647
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:12,772
If any company's facing a loss.

648
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:15,484
Doesn't she ask about you?

649
00:38:15,484 --> 00:38:16,800
Yes.

650
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,016
Sometimes, she does ask about me, too.

651
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:20,440
She even says, chuckling,

652
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,690
'Why don't get married a second time'?

653
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:30,266
Have there been any issues between the two of you?

654
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,563
Yes.

655
00:38:31,563 --> 00:38:32,521
What?

656
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:38,205
That we don't have any issues of love between us.

657
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:39,379
I'm sorry,

658
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,314
But sometimes,

659
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:44,700
I laugh at the wrong things.

660
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,140
Excuse me.
-Alright.

661
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,015
How was it?

662
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:49,765
Very good.

663
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,828
This flute is my friend.

664
00:39:52,828 --> 00:39:54,449
And this tune

665
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:57,749
Is the tale of my heart.

666
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,039
When I'm alone,

667
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,378
I hum this.

668
00:40:04,378 --> 00:40:06,097
When I'm tormented,

669
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:09,057
I play it.

670
00:40:09,488 --> 00:40:11,428
Why don't you say anything, M. Danish?

671
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:14,477
You've been so quiet.

672
00:40:14,477 --> 00:40:15,673
By the way,

673
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,924
This shirt suits you.

674
00:40:17,924 --> 00:40:21,883
Perhaps it wouldn't even suit me so well.

675
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:23,706
It's 1 now, M. Shehwar.

676
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:25,648
We should leave now.

677
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:27,955
You're a strange kind of friend.

678
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:30,972
Even in friendship, you'd remember the time when coming and leaving?

679
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:35,077
I have to go to the office in the morning. I'd been late today, too.

680
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,787
Yes, I can understand.

681
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:40,002
C'mon, then.

682
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,480
Come.

683
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,131
Did you have fun?

684
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:52,350
You enjoyed your movie?

685
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,124
How was the movie?

686
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:55,338
Innit?

687
00:40:55,338 --> 00:40:57,588
Oh, great!

688
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:00,586
M. Danish,

689
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,335
Here's a watch for you.

690
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,023
Hey -- Why?

691
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:05,930
Please, keep it.

692
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,091
It's a friend's first gift to his friend.

693
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,522
Also, it's a tradition in my family

694
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:13,303
To give a gift to our guests

695
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:15,274
On their first visit here

696
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,554
To cherish the memories.

697
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:20,698
Please, take it, or it'd hurt me very much.

698
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,449
Thank you.

699
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:24,366
Here.

700
00:41:24,366 --> 00:41:25,338
And

701
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:29,257
This is for you, M. Rumi; there's a lot of chocolates in this.

702
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:31,102
And here's a little piano,

703
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,677
It also has the tune I'd just played.
-Thank you.

704
00:41:33,677 --> 00:41:35,492
You're welcome.

705
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,478
And

706
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:40,681
This is for you.

707
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:45,568
All of this is very expensive, M. Shehwar...

708
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:49,116
Your lady is priceless, too.

709
00:41:51,993 --> 00:41:56,024
Lovers are priceless.

710
00:41:56,024 --> 00:41:59,419
Such things are an offering unto them.

711
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:01,883
In fact, why don't you have her

712
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:05,895
Put this on right now?

713
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:07,895
Please, put this on her.

714
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:12,301
I'd be chuffed if you put this on her.

715
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,120
Should I take this one off?

716
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
