1
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,791
What are you looking at?

2
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,525
I wanted to tell you something.

3
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:17,791
Go on.

4
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,230
The parking fellow Khanam Khan,

5
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,034
Yes?

6
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:25,511
His son's been enrolled in a school too.

7
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:26,531
So?

8
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,119
Do you want me to get you enrolled where he is?

9
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,650
Have you seen his school?

10
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,900
It's a decrepit wreck.

11
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,900
So would I be attending a majestic school?

12
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,464
But of course.

13
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:41,011
My son will be attending such a majestic school that all my friends would look in awe.

14
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,604
When?

15
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,460
Let me see who it is.

16
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,322
Good morning.

17
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:57,130
Good morning.

18
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,041
Remember me?

19
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,740
I don't exactly recognise you,

20
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,647
But I've seen you somewhere in this building.

21
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:04,316
Monty.

22
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:06,263
Oh, Monty...

23
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,325
Danish was talking about you yesterday.

24
00:02:08,325 --> 00:02:09,840
What did he say?

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,308
The car that you have.

26
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:13,058
He was talking about it.

27
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:15,346
He said that we might be buying it.

28
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:16,855
Right...

29
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:18,230
Did he also mention

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,850
What I'd said about you?

31
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,825
No,

32
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,027
He didn't mention anything else.

33
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,538
What did you say?

34
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,444
May I say it before you?

35
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,192
Yes, go on.

36
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,067
First, take these sweets from the oblation.

37
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,787
My Mum's specifically asked me

38
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,973
To give this to the family

39
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,534
Of the most comely lady downstairs.

40
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:45,401
But I disagree with her.

41
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,894
My eye

42
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:49,660
Will never find any more comely than you

43
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,130
In this building.

44
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:53,940
Interesting...

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,648
Please, pay a visit sometime.

46
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:58,429
Perhaps on the pretext of purchasing the car?

47
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,705
Sure.

48
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,004
Thank you for the oblation.

49
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,897
Welcome.

50
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,765
What is it?

51
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,321
There. Just have a little bit of it.

52
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:29,024
Alright?

53
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,121
Hello?

54
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,372
I'm coming over.

55
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,479
Sure, come.

56
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,448
I'm not coming over as in to sit with you.

57
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,197
We're going shopping.

58
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:55,734
Now?

59
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,168
When, if not now?

60
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,618
No, I meant --

61
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:00,885
Danish is not at home.

62
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,790
If we took Rumi along, he'd be pestering us all the way.

63
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,466
Don't worry, mate, we'll get him an ice cream and have him stay with the driver.

64
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,517
Get ready, now, I'm coming.

65
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,685
Hey!

66
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,811
It's the same one I'd mentioned, innit?

67
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:28,976
It's the same, sir.

68
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,616
You may check again.

69
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,179
Yes, it's the same.

70
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,275
Pack this one, then.
-Okay, sir.

71
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,979
Pack this one here.

72
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:51,978
Here.

73
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:54,292
Here's a bundle of 100,000 Rupees.
-Alright.

74
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:58,666
You now owe me 2,000 now.
-I'll give you in a moment.

75
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,337
Thank you.

76
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:02,084
You're welcome.

77
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,740
Behave like a good boy --
-Bonjour, Madame!

78
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,223
Bonjour.

79
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:12,208
How are you, Rumi?

80
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,717
Come.

81
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:14,969
You'll be a good boy, won't you?

82
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,561
Bye, Rumi!

83
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,626
Say bye to him.

84
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:31,774
Hello!

85
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:32,789
How are you?

86
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:33,633
Hi!

87
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,869
Hi! How are you?

88
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,589
I'm fine!

89
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,640
Shall we?

90
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,091
Don't you have the keys to the door?

91
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,623
It's you, M. Monty!

92
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:37,171
I have the keys,

93
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,717
But...

94
00:06:38,717 --> 00:06:39,905
How are you?

95
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,329
Madame's not at home.

96
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:43,452
She left with a friend of hers just a while ago.

97
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:45,951
In her car.

98
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:47,591
Anoushay.

99
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:49,983
It must be Anoushay, a friend of hers from college.

100
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,373
What it is is

101
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:52,892
I'm not usually back at this hour.

102
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:55,452
She must've left.

103
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,326
How are you?

104
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:58,437
I'm fine.

105
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,780
Here it is!

106
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,450
Won't you purchase the car?

107
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,296
Which one?

108
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,045
Yours?

109
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,693
No, it's old.

110
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,862
I'll buy a new one. 0 meter [unused].

111
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:14,357
The thing is,

112
00:07:14,357 --> 00:07:16,983
I don't like something

113
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:19,577
That's been touched by someone else.

114
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:21,356
Good day.

115
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,333
Hello Papa!

116
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,005
Hello, Rumi.

117
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,064
Where's Maman?

118
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:40,693
Maman's gone shopping with Aunt Anoushay.

119
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,850
And where are you?

120
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,457
I'm in the play area, having an ice cream.

121
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:46,132
Right, who's with you?

122
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,989
Uncle Driver; do you want to talk to him?
-No.

123
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:50,709
Enjoy your ice cream,

124
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,774
And tell Maman when she's back to call me.

125
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,959
I'm home.

126
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,374
Alright.
-Love you.

127
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,574
Love you too.

128
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,618
How's this?

129
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:17,776
It's very good.

130
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:18,680
How much for this?

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,307
70,000.

132
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,026
Okay.

133
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,177
And this one?

134
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,091
How much for this?

135
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:26,165
This is expensive. 300,000.

136
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,776
So what if it's 300,000?

137
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:30,075
Pack that one.

138
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,465
It's so beautiful, right?

139
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:44,843
Pack this one.
-Okay.

140
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:46,763
Pack this one.

141
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,066
Anoushay!

142
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,082
Just a minute.

143
00:08:56,918 --> 00:09:00,250
Mind if I say something?

144
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,171
Could you lend me 80,000 Rupees?

145
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:05,734
I'll return it in 8 months.

146
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,260
I mean, 10,000 a month.

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,776
No problem,

148
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,879
But

149
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:13,597
The money I have is all Aamir's.

150
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:17,024
Alright, hold on, I'll ask him.

151
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,020
Please show me that necklace.
-Sure.

152
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,038
Hello?

153
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:28,819
Yes,

154
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:31,189
I've bought the gown.

155
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:35,116
The jewellery too. I'm with Mehwish, of course.
-It's a magnificent design, and a new one at that.

156
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,073
Alright,

157
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:38,184
I'm lending 80,000 to Mehwish.

158
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:39,603
A necklace caught her eye.

159
00:09:39,603 --> 00:09:40,506
She says

160
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:43,756
She'll pay us back in 8 months.

161
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,709
Okay, thank you.

162
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,379
No, I have the money with me.

163
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:57,038
I'll buy my shoes and all.

164
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:59,872
Okay, bye.

165
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,539
He's agreed.

166
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,000
Thank you!

167
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,043
How's this?

168
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:10,072
Very lovely.

169
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,893
Please,

170
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,877
Take this off.
-Okay.

171
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,063
Three club sandwiches and three cups of tea.

172
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:12,023
Maman!

173
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:13,224
Here.

174
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,478
Take all of these.

175
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:15,162
And

176
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:17,346
Help yourself to something.

177
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,080
This --

178
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,121
Don't give him the ones with the jewellery.

179
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,632
Why?

180
00:11:23,137 --> 00:11:25,075
Please give me this one --

181
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,923
Mine's the small, white one.

182
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:28,174
Right.

183
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:29,779
I've --

184
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:31,821
I've longed for months.

185
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:37,074
I want to keep it by my side every moment now that I've bought it at last.

186
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,589
Papa called to tell that he's home.

187
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,886
Oh...

188
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,404
It's 6 already,

189
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,198
And I haven't cooked anything.

190
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:47,853
Well,

191
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:49,915
He'll have an omelette.

192
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:50,863
Give me the phone.

193
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,873
That was all fine, but

194
00:11:52,873 --> 00:11:55,688
As it happens...

195
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,692
Oh, hi!

196
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,808
Just a minute, I'll be back.

197
00:12:12,781 --> 00:12:15,937
Oh my God, what a pleasant surprise!

198
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:18,571
I was just passing by; thought of having coffee.

199
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,344
How are you?

200
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:20,718
I'm fine.

201
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,046
This is my friend,

202
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:22,983
Mehwish.

203
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:24,203
Aamir's boss.

204
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,096
Hi.

205
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,296
And who's this cute little boy?

206
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,344
This is Mehwish's son, Rumi.

207
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:34,579
Mon Dieu! You're so beautiful, just like your Mum!

208
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,021
I can't believe it

209
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:38,969
That your friend is married.

210
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:44,140
Why do all the beauteous and comely girls get married so early?

211
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,097
Désolé, Madame, I hope you don't mind?

212
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:47,484
Why would she mind?

213
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:50,817
What kind of girl would mind being told she's very beautiful and comely?

214
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,531
And you've even said she doesn't look like she's married.

215
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:54,703
Alright, so

216
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,437
You'll be there at the wedding, won't you?

217
00:12:56,437 --> 00:12:57,951
How could I not?

218
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:01,105
Aamir's not just my colleague; he's a friend too.

219
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,611
I'll attend the Mehendi and I'll be dancing too!

220
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:04,540
Dance?

221
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,920
I don't believe it.

222
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,214
Why? Why can't you believe it?

223
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:09,074
Not until I see it!

224
00:13:09,074 --> 00:13:10,757
Once I start dancing,

225
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,900
I can best the best out there.
-Oh, right!

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,068
We'll see about that.

227
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:15,803
Alright.

228
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:16,616
I'll take my leave.

229
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:19,255
Bye.

230
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,507
Do you know he's a billionaire?

231
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,400
But he's not arrogant at all.

232
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,168
He's more like a family member to us.

233
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:30,695
He's seen

234
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:34,756
That sorrow doesn't even spare the rich.

235
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,124
What's his sorrow?

236
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,209
His wife.

237
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,273
They don't get together at all.

238
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:42,633
They used to have rows for the first 8 or 9 years of their marriage.

239
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:45,324
Then, his wife went to her parents in America.

240
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,429
Now, she stays in America for 10 months a year!

241
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,558
Sad...

242
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:53,257
She's a right insolent lass.

243
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:55,698
Good Lord, so suspicious!

244
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:57,457
If she were sitting here,

245
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,872
She'd have grabbed him by the collar.

246
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,908
Is she mad?

247
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,340
Of course she's mad.

248
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,744
If she saw Maria with him,

249
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,515
She'd have started screaming before everyone,

250
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,613
'Look at yourself, gadding about with your secretary'!

251
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,481
Hey!

252
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,767
She even slapped his previous secretary

253
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,314
Before everyone in the office.

254
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,215
Why?

255
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,654
What do I tell you?

256
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,056
Shehwar went to Hong Kong

257
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,496
And took her along.

258
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,217
She created such a ruckus the moment she found out.

259
00:14:23,217 --> 00:14:24,981
Why did she go along in the first place?

260
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,362
They do go.

261
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,271
Secretaries to these toffs

262
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,311
Generally go along on foreign trips.

263
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:33,154
It's not a big deal.

264
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,468
She must've thought there's something going on between the two.

265
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,779
That's the problem.

266
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,855
But why is this a problem?

267
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,200
She should be happy

268
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,983
That her husband is so handsome,

269
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,452
Wealthy,

270
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,297
And

271
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:49,231
Still loyal to her.

272
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,390
He's loyal to her, isn't he?

273
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,326
How could he be loyal?

274
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:59,216
Which husband would chant utterances of loyalty if the wife spends 10 months in America?

275
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,420
Well,

276
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,671
He's managing his part.

277
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,441
How long will he?

278
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,419
She owns shares in all three companies of Shehwar's.

279
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:10,805
I think that's why he tolerates her.

280
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:11,430
Alright,

281
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,260
The sandwiches are here.

282
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,858
Keep the phone here.

283
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,470
Come on.

284
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,008
Won't you come upstairs?

285
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,360
No, mate, it's getting late.

286
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,070
Besides,

287
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,945
Danish would've grown old waiting for you.

288
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:53,810
Go.

289
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,006
Alright, God be with ye.
-Bye!

290
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:57,985
Come.

291
00:15:57,985 --> 00:15:59,601
Here.

292
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,421
Sorry.

293
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:34,197
Go,

294
00:16:34,197 --> 00:16:36,150
Go and change, quickly.

295
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,755
Why was your phone switched off?

296
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:41,293
The battery had died. C'mon now.

297
00:16:42,074 --> 00:16:44,486
There was nothing to eat; I had an omelette.

298
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,338
Yes, I knew that.

299
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,168
You make such a fine omelette.

300
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:50,983
C'mon, mate.

301
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,684
Is an omelette anything like a lunch?

302
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:58,560
Get something to eat, will you? I'm tired, Danish.

303
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:06,042
Celebrating a wedding that isn't even yours.

304
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,390
What do you mean?

305
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,919
I'm being honest.

306
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,183
Look at who's getting married,

307
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:12,667
And you're shopping yourself to death.

308
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,309
Anoushay's my friend.

309
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:16,390
Dearer to me than my life.

310
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,496
Splendid.

311
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,670
Have you forgotten? Just yesterday, I was dearer to you than your life.

312
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,579
Yes.

313
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,320
I remember that too.

314
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,893
You'd do well to remember, too,

315
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:28,583
How you'd usurped upon my life.

316
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,804
All the grandiose dreams you had me imagine,

317
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:36,029
And then you immured me in this tiny flat after our marriage.

318
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,251
Don't worry, my love.

319
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:42,055
Our times will change.

320
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,626
Your promises won't change times, Danish.

321
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:47,656
Day after day will just go by.

322
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,002
What's up with you?

323
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:50,923
In the mood for a domestic?

324
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:52,237
Not at all.

325
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,328
Then why are you acting so rough?

326
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:56,909
It's --

327
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,611
I've borrowed 80,000 from Anoushay.

328
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,755
Why?

329
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:03,794
Wait and listen.

330
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:06,064
There's no hurry to pay her back.

331
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:08,330
We only owe her 10,000 a month.

332
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,527
We have 8 months.

333
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,422
But why?

334
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:17,146
You're feeling bad about it?

335
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:19,721
I --

336
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,596
This --

337
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,665
I've bought this necklace.

338
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:33,472
I thought

339
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:36,418
You'd not be able to arrange 80,000 so promptly.

340
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,790
My wish will remain unfulfilled.

341
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,144
So,

342
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:44,580
I mustered the courage to ask Anoushay...

343
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,972
I know what you're thinking.

344
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,237
It's struck you, hasn't it,

345
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:06,694
How you'd arrange 10,000 a month?

346
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,167
Don't worry.

347
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,559
For eight months, we'd even take Sundays as Mondays.

348
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,435
We'd not go anywhere.

349
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:14,902
Not even to a restaurant.

350
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:19,232
That saves 10,000, now, doesn't it?

351
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,715
You can't believe it, can you?

352
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:24,938
Still, believe it.

353
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:26,898
I'd -- Manage -- somehow.

354
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:30,643
And save the money too.

355
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,832
Why are you smiling at every line?

356
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:41,310
I'm smiling because of something else.

357
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm laughing at the fact that you know about everything,

358
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,616
But there is one thing that you haven't the foggiest about,

359
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:49,122
Nor can you understand it.

360
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,506
What?

361
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:58,434
I love you very much, Mehwish.

362
00:19:58,434 --> 00:19:59,499
There, now.

363
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,760
I wondered what it was that you'd say.

364
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,355
What more could I possibly say?

365
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,454
And what more could you possibly want to hear?

366
00:20:07,454 --> 00:20:09,324
Just tell me,

367
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,703
Surely, you don't mind 10,000 a month, do you?

368
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:13,886
And if you say that you don't mind,

369
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,921
And that you're delighted to see the necklace,

370
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:18,406
I'd take it that you love me very much.

371
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:21,173
Only that I do mind, Mehwish.

372
00:20:21,173 --> 00:20:26,013
I do not want that for eight months, my wife should sit before her friend with her head bowed.

373
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:27,379
Don't be crazy.

374
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:30,692
Why would I bow my head before my friend?

375
00:20:30,692 --> 00:20:32,848
Not before your friend,

376
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:36,348
But before the lender.

377
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:38,926
And it's quite natural, Mehwish,

378
00:20:38,926 --> 00:20:44,043
One's head bows and gaze lowers before the one whom one owes something.

379
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:46,681
Alright, I'll return the necklace.

380
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:49,020
When did I say that?

381
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,567
Keep the necklace,

382
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,944
And give her what you owe her.

383
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:55,301
How?

384
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:04,206
That's a total of 140,000.

385
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,018
Give Anoushay what you owe her,

386
00:21:06,018 --> 00:21:08,113
And keep the rest with yourself.

387
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:13,003
Where did you get so much money?

388
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:19,065
It's a reward for besmearing Dad's grave.

389
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:21,301
That's all it ever was.

390
00:21:21,301 --> 00:21:24,535
If you besmear a deceased Dad's memory for once,

391
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:28,728
He dies forever.

392
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:36,008
I tell you,

393
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:41,828
He'd haunt me neither in memories, nor dreams.

394
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,910
Please, turn of the light; I'm sleepy.

395
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:30,643
Where's Rumi?

396
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:34,254
He's sleeping. He said he won't have breakfast when I roused him.

397
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,956
Right...

398
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,267
You're vexed with me, aren't you?

399
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,128
No?

400
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:04,962
Why should I be vexed with you?

401
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:05,845
The same.

402
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:08,440
I purchased the necklace without asking you,

403
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,361
Borrowing money from Anoushay.

404
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,454
That's done and over already, mate.

405
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:15,815
Once you've returned the money, I wouldn't even remember

406
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:19,954
That you'd ever done something so witless.

407
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:23,928
Why are you calling it 'witless'?

408
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:27,782
I'd apologise for saying it's 'witless'.

409
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:29,955
There's no need for that.

410
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,079
I admit that I made a mistake,

411
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,675
But I'd never admit that to wish is witless.

412
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,362
Even if they remain unfulfilled,

413
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:39,050
Everyone has dreams,

414
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,549
Wishes; everyone tries to fulfil them, too.

415
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:46,910
That'd make all of them witless.

416
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:54,265
From this day on, hold firm to all your dreams,

417
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:58,171
Wish for everything you couldn't get,

418
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:02,638
For I'm right here.

419
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:06,646
I'll try everything I can.

420
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,291
The Mehendi's in the evening.

421
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,448
We're going at 7, remember?

422
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,518
Yes, I remember.

423
00:24:18,518 --> 00:24:20,536
Just come back quickly.

424
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:22,649
I'll be back by 5.

425
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:23,619
Take the money.

426
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,230
Get something for yourself on the way back, too.

427
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,686
The money's for you, Mehwish.

428
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:31,385
Just get something you like.

429
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:36,181
I'll be chuffed to see you happy.

430
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:39,931
I love you.

431
00:24:39,931 --> 00:24:42,333
I love you too.

432
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,928
Monsieur's waiting for you.

433
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,621
Come.

434
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:06,552
May I come in, sir?

435
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,485
Come in, M. Danish.

436
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:13,306
We've been waiting for you for 15 minutes.

437
00:25:13,306 --> 00:25:15,212
15 minutes, sir?

438
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,582
I -- I'm just 5 minutes late.

439
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,380
Who said anything about you being late?

440
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,523
I'm talking about waiting for you.

441
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,729
Yes, sir.

442
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:28,848
Meet Messrs Fawad and Jawad here.

443
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,611
The names sound familiar, sir.

444
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:35,938
You've heard and seen the names.

445
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:39,241
There's a file titled Fawad & Jawad in your possession.

446
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,487
Yes, sir, there is one.

447
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:42,064
Should I get it, sir?
-It's here.

448
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:44,484
Look at this, it's right here.

449
00:25:44,484 --> 00:25:45,188
But sir --

450
00:25:45,188 --> 00:25:46,938
This file was in my cupboard.

451
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:48,049
And my cupboard --

452
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,719
Is locked --
-Oh?

453
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:54,390
So you've started differentiating your cupboard and keys from ours?

454
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,222
Please, take this file,

455
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,987
And sign wherever it's marked

456
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:02,007
With a red pencil circle.

457
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:04,485
Sir, may I get 10 minutes?

458
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,195
What for?

459
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,469
I'll study the file.

460
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:08,502
Monsieur,

461
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:12,002
Gone are your days of fussing over studying the file.

462
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:14,988
Open your eyes and sign the file,

463
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:19,750
Take your 100,000 Rupees from M. Fawad Ahmed, and close your eyes.

464
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,829
And yes,

465
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,922
The 200,000 Rupees that had been given to you yesterday were for the same.

466
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:28,188
Oh -- Alright...

467
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:32,103
Open an account under Madame's name,

468
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:34,571
And deposit all this money to that account,

469
00:26:34,571 --> 00:26:37,789
Or spend it as soon as you go.

470
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,419
Why -- Is there any danger, sir?

471
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,400
There's always a danger,

472
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,101
But this money is exactly what's useful when you're in danger.

473
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:15,947
Listen!

474
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:18,277
Get me some tea, will you?

475
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,392
I will, sure, but before I go,

476
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:22,118
Do give me a sweetener.

477
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,713
Sweetener?

478
00:27:23,713 --> 00:27:25,369
2%.

479
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,448
Adding the previous 200,000, that'd be 6,000.

480
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,151
Oh...

481
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,984
You take it from the boss too?

482
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,023
I take it on the orders of the boss.

483
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,023
Okay.

484
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:37,032
You'll get it.

485
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,883
I'll get you your tea.

486
00:27:56,986 --> 00:27:57,706
Alright,

487
00:27:57,706 --> 00:27:58,580
Danish is calling.

488
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,770
I'll disconnect.

489
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,285
Yes, I'll be there on time.

490
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,003
Oui, Monsieur!

491
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:10,574
I figure you've begun missing me the moment you got there.

492
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:12,214
What are you doing?

493
00:28:12,214 --> 00:28:13,746
I was talking to Anoushay.

494
00:28:13,746 --> 00:28:16,732
Did you tell her that you'd give her 80,000 today?

495
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:18,325
I did.

496
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,851
It must've baffled her.

497
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:22,639
She couldn't believe it.

498
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,345
When you return the money,

499
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:25,527
Say 'Thank you', and add,

500
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:29,293
That she may feel free to ask for 1 or 2 hundred thousand if she ever needs it.

501
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:30,211
Ask whom?

502
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,291
You, of course.

503
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,525
You're just saying that, right?

504
00:28:34,525 --> 00:28:36,682
Why would I just say that?

505
00:28:36,682 --> 00:28:38,997
I'm telling the truth.

506
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,619
Alright,

507
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,479
You know the bank nearby?

508
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,511
Yes.

509
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,574
Go there

510
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:45,917
And open your account there.

511
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,650
What for?

512
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,966
You're alright, aren't you?

513
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,901
I'm perfectly alright, Mehwish.

514
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:52,340
Just do

515
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,245
As I'm saying.

516
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:59,458
Okay.
-Okay, listen.

517
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:04,137
I love you.

518
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:06,693
Me too.

519
00:29:11,948 --> 00:29:14,158
Papa said 'I love you', didn't he?

520
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:19,311
Let me tell you, you rapscallion! Overhearing everything! How would you like a good tickle?

521
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:21,006
Get aside.

522
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:23,508
It's my turn.

523
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:20,961
Right, how much will it be?

524
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,100
Alright.

525
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,401
How are you, M. Shehwar?
-How are you? I'm fine. Congratulations.

526
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:33,446
Thank you!
-All good?

527
00:30:33,446 --> 00:30:35,593
Hello!

528
00:30:35,593 --> 00:30:36,529
You're looking beautiful!

529
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:38,527
Thank you so much; you look very handsome yourself!

530
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,884
There, now, if it isn't your comely friend.

531
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,336
Hi!

532
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:43,446
Hello!

533
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:46,099
Congratulations!
-Thank you so much.

534
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:47,149
Hello, Mehwish!

535
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,539
Hi.

536
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,145
I'm sure he's your husband?

537
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:51,644
Yes.

538
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:52,749
Shehwar Ahmed.

539
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:54,531
Danish.

540
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:56,733
Hello! How are you? Everything alright?

541
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:57,916
Shall we?

542
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,483
C'mon.

543
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,360
Over here.

544
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:26,305
Quite the arrangement, I must say! Of course.
-We've tried the best we could.

545
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:29,581
But it's their marriage and our headache.

546
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,943
Right, yes...

547
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,690
Who's this man?

548
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,700
Aamir's boss.

549
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,910
We'd gone to a restaurant the other day after shopping.

550
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,620
We'd met back then.

551
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,300
Just 'by the way'.

552
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,240
But he still remembers your name.

553
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,590
Some people have a strong memory.

554
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:43,590
Every man has a strong memory when it comes to les belle femmes!

555
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,220
What does he do?

556
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,950
'Do', as in?

557
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,780
I mean, where does he work?

558
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,440
Looking at him, do you honestly think he'd work?

559
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,830
I just told you, he's Aamir's boss.

560
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,020
He owns three companies.

561
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,295
Anoushay told me he's a billionaire.

562
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:16,146
Splendid!

563
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:19,085
C'mon, now, it's your turn. You have to show us your dance.

564
00:33:19,085 --> 00:33:19,773
Me?

565
00:33:19,773 --> 00:33:22,452
You'd promised.

566
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:24,820
Alright, but...

567
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,226
Get me something to drink.

568
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:28,167
Oh --

569
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:32,379
Get up, then, we'd have to go over to that corner.

570
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,060
Let's go.

571
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,960
Come.

572
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,589
Do you know where he's going?

573
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:41,463
Where?

574
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:44,683
To have a bevvy.

575
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:46,192
Let him.

576
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:49,776
Would you look at who's going along as his bartender?

577
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,699
Don't look that way, Danish.

578
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:54,307
It's acceptable among these toffs.

579
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:56,605
It's acceptable with them,

580
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:59,572
But at least your friend should be ashamed.

581
00:33:59,572 --> 00:34:02,798
Shut up, please.

582
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,508
You've brought 80,000, haven't you?

583
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:10,168
Yes.

584
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:11,976
When she's back after indulging him,

585
00:34:11,976 --> 00:34:15,540
Give it to her.

586
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,923
I will.

587
00:34:20,514 --> 00:34:23,083
What are you doing? Come on, already.

588
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,260
Wait.

589
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,888
What happened? Are you alright?

590
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:27,492
The thing is...

591
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:29,229
Then?

592
00:34:29,229 --> 00:34:31,492
Tell me, first, who would dance with me?

593
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:32,928
I would, obviously.

594
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:35,496
You know, I'm really good.

595
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:36,537
Oui,

596
00:34:36,537 --> 00:34:39,106
That's true...

597
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,520
He's looking your way.

598
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:53,887
Your friend...

599
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,420
Can I dance with her?

600
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,513
No, she's with her husband...

601
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,952
And he's really conservative.

602
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:02,274
Very bad...

603
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:06,121
Why do all these jolies filles have to get married?

604
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:08,836
I don't know.

605
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:09,646
Anyway,

606
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:12,130
Good luck to her.

607
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,160
Finish the drink already; how much more would you have?

608
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,180
Whatever's up!

609
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,210
Where's Anoushay's husband?

610
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,220
He's not come.

611
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,750
What do you mean?

612
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,410
He wouldn't attend his brother-in-law's Mehendi?

613
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,960
Yes, he wouldn't.

614
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,270
Why?

615
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,130
Because he's no longer her husband.

616
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,010
What?

617
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,110
They've been divorced?

618
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,580
Hush, Danish!

619
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,700
That's why she's gadding about with other men.

620
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,670
And Aamir!

621
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,140
He's such a dishonourable bloke,

622
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,100
Having his sister dance with his boss!

623
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,510
Quiet, please.

624
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,430
What if someone heard it?

625
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,260
Okay, okay...

626
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,710
Maman, PP.

627
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,360
Danish,

628
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,530
Rumi needs to go to the washroom.

629
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,050
Where's the washroom?

630
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,780
Ask around; how would I know?

631
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,290
Alright, I'll see.

632
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,510
Come on. Come.

633
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,730
Hello!

634
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,610
Hi.

635
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,010
May I have this dance?

636
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,480
I know your husband doesn't like it,

637
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,460
But I want to.

638
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,700
I'm sorry,

639
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,550
But I can't.

640
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,190
Trust me,

641
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,370
My intentions aren't bad.

642
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,720
It --

643
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,410
It wouldn't exactly please my husband.

644
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,230
Okay.

645
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,260
Listen.

646
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,850
Please

647
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,290
Don't mind it.

648
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,050
Don't say that.

649
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,730
One who goes through

650
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,500
Such a heartbreak would mind it.

651
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
