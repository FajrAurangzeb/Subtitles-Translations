1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,220
Good morning, Ma'am.

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,345
Good morning. Please, come in. Come and sit down.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,180
Miss Mehwish...

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,576
Please, sit.

5
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:18,886
This is Miss Hania,

6
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,290
In-charge of Rumi's class.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,592
Hi.

8
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,186
Hi.

9
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:27,990
I suppose we've met before?

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,400
No.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,208
We've talked over the phone before.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,197
So, you've come to meet Rumi?

13
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:39,770
No, I've come to take him along.

14
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,720
I'd take him along when school's over at 1.30.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,230
I'd leave him here before the evening.
-Of course.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,710
Would you like some tea?

17
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,920
No, thank you.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,770
Okay.

19
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,480
Have you got a permission letter

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,151
From his father?

21
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,427
Permission letter?

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,940
I'm his mother, Ma'am.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,620
Of course, you may be,

24
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,970
But how'd I know that?

25
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,767
I'm meeting you for the first time.

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,530
Please call Rumi; he'd tell you.

27
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,570
If Rumi said you're his mother, I could allow you to <i>meet</i> him,

28
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,146
But I can't <i>send</i> him with you.

29
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:26,370
If he told you I'm his mother,

30
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,800
Why can't he come with me?

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,160
Look...

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,610
If you don't have a permission letter,

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,270
I can't send Rumi with you.

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,531
I'm sorry, but these are the rules. We have to follow them.

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,910
I'm surprised.

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,128
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,570
Call his father.

38
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,580
Ask him.

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,430
We can't depend on phone calls.

40
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,000
You know very well

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,750
That anyone can say anything over the phone.

42
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,540
Besides, just a few days ago, his phone had accidentally ended up with

43
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,536
Besides, just a few days ago, his phone had accidentally ended up with Miss Hania.

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,220
I need a letter.

45
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,750
I need a permission letter,

46
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,810
Or...

47
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,360
Or?

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,004
Or an order from the court.

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,971
Alright.

50
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,485
Call Rumi.

51
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:35,220
I'll just meet him today.

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Of course.

53
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,616
That's not a problem.

54
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,366
I'll call him here.

55
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,328
I'd say you wait in the room next to this one.

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,480
You can meet him there.

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,361
Thank you.

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,741
Right, so why should I marry a lad who's wearing a long face all the time?

59
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,200
Be a man.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,350
I am a man.

61
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,410
Alright, then, c'mon.

62
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,190
Your Maman's come to meet you.

63
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,941
No.

64
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,450
What?

65
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,630
I said 'No'.

66
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm not meeting her.

67
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,690
One doesn't say 'no' to Maman.

68
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,150
You'd have to meet her.

69
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,406
I'd never meet her.

70
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,080
She'd cry a lot if she heard that,

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,020
And think your Papa's told you not to meet her.

72
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,750
No.

73
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,426
My Papa never told me not to meet her.

74
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:03,670
But she will think so.

75
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,500
Why would she?

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,167
Why would she think so if he's never stopped me?

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,970
Don't you miss your Mum?

78
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,467
Yes, I do miss her...

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,560
Ask her to never come to my school.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,840
I will never meet her.

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,847
Never!

82
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,638
Please, sign here.

83
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,507
We need your thumb impression over here.

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,831
Next.

85
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,566
That's it.

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,946
Here.

87
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,550
Give him the money.

88
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,987
Here's one million.

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,340
You can count if you like.

90
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,648
I don't count anymore.

91
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,689
I weigh it.

92
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,661
Thank you.

93
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,966
What?

94
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,580
Are you crazy?

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,130
My son would say that she doesn't want to meet his Maman?

96
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,010
Impossible!

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,720
Take me to him right now!
-Excuse me.

98
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,770
One, you're not talking to me so rudely,

99
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,390
And two, I've told you what your son has said,

100
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,270
And, being his teacher,

101
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,420
I cannot force him, right?

102
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,136
Who the hell are you?

103
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,100
A responsible teacher.

104
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,841
A responsible teacher. Thank you.

105
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,240
Oh!

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,486
So all of you are in on it with Danish Akhtar!

107
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,387
Fine.

108
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,180
I'll take care of all of you.

109
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,160
I'll take care of all of you.
-Listen!

110
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,250
With this attitude, you won't even be able to see me.

111
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,870
The guard won't let you inside the school the next time. Do you get it?

112
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,252
Goodbye.

113
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,550
Why are you worried?

114
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,680
Don't you pity such a woman,

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,226
Who'd be crying out to her son, 'I'm your mother'?

116
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,440
Take it that the punishment for ruining a household begins here.

117
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,116
Have you done what I'd asked you to do?

118
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,250
Good afternoon, sir.

119
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,390
Good afternoon.

120
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,210
Tea or coffee?

121
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,440
Nothing.

122
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,226
Sir?

123
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:55,877
Nothing.

124
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,620
You've been coming here late for a few days, M. Danish.

125
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,520
Yes.

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,981
Why?

127
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,316
Because I won't be coming now.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,460
Aye, mate...

129
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,711
The crazy git!

130
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,860
When I asked why he's late,

131
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,660
He said, 'I won't be coming now'.

132
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,960
He means he won't be coming late now.

133
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
No, mate.

134
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,790
You don't get it.

135
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,560
His promotion's gotten to his head.

136
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,700
Someone should tell him that M. Matin's no more.

137
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,388
He'd better not show such pride!

138
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,876
Bye, everyone.

139
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,236
Goodbye.

140
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,060
Do you folks even know

141
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,890
That M. Danish has resigned?

142
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
M. Danish has resigned?

143
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,796
How could that be?

144
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm sorry, Dad.

145
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,061
I've sold the flat.

146
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,016
Forgive me.

147
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,780
Hello?

148
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,390
Hello.

149
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,680
This is Hania speaking, M. Danish.

150
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,990
Yes, Miss Hania?

151
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,340
It's been --

152
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,100
Bothering me since the afternoon; I was thinking whether I should tell you this...

153
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,890
Please, tell me if there's any problem.

154
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,490
There's a problem, M. Danish.

155
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,920
Your ex-wife is a problem.

156
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,470
What happened?

157
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,560
She'd come to the school to meet Rumi,

158
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,770
And wanted to take him along when school's over.

159
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,910
She was rather angry when the Headmistress declined.

160
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,920
Then, she agreed to see Rumi for a while, but...

161
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,470
Rumi didn't agree to see her.

162
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,570
Didn't agree?

163
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,390
He didn't meet her?

164
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,276
Right.

165
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,217
That's not good.

166
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,560
Mehwish is his mother, he should've met her.

167
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,220
That's what I've called to ask you -

168
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,080
Whether Rumi would decide if he wants to meet his mother, or his mother's husband?

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you mean?

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,430
It's clear, M. Danish.

171
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:10,215
He may not be forced if he doesn't want to meet her.

172
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,530
I talked to the Hostel Warden a short while ago.

173
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,072
He's been sleeping since 5 p.m.

174
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:22,920
Do you know why kids like him go to sleep so early?

175
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,090
Why do they?

176
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,160
Because they're afraid.

177
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,840
They want to forget that anything of the sort ever happened.

178
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,050
Whatever he may do, Miss Hania,

179
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,746
He'd have to meet his mother.

180
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,990
Alright.

181
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,670
I'll not be responsible for his next progress report.

182
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,210
Your child will remain timid,

183
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,150
And timid children never perform well.

184
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,966
Take care. Bye.

185
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,790
Hello?

186
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,000
Blimey, mate.

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,730
What's it with your theatrics?

188
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,590
Why are you creating troubles for yourself?

189
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,570
Who is it?

190
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,130
Oh?

191
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,410
So you don't even know who I am?

192
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,480
M. Shehwar?

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,760
What do you want?

194
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,170
What would I want?

195
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,870
Be done with this drama.

196
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,620
How much should I pay you

197
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,920
To make you end this balderdash?

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,806
What have I done?

199
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,936
Why don't you let Mehwish meet her son?

200
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,720
No, M. Shehwar -- By the Lord, I haven't stopped him.

201
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,810
I've just gotten to know that he refused to meet her when she'd gone there.

202
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,760
I've even told the folks at the school that it wasn't proper.

203
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,990
Look,

204
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,910
I give you two days.

205
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,710
The two of them should meet on the third day,

206
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,946
Or my lawyers will have your hide.

207
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,956
I've sold the flat.

208
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,520
I've resigned, too.

209
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,790
I'll start my own business,

210
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,600
And this business is a full-time job.

211
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,150
One has to work very hard in the beginning.

212
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,960
If you remain adamant on not meeting your Maman,

213
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,510
The two of them will think I've taught you this,

214
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,180
That I've forbidden you from meeting her.

215
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,879
Two -- who?

216
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:46,486
Your Maman and her husband.

217
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,770
Look at me.

218
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,550
I know you don't like that man.

219
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,660
You don't want to meet him.

220
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,960
But you have to do this for your Maman, Rumi.

221
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,090
I don't want to meet my Maman.

222
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,550
You're just being stubborn, Rumi.

223
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,600
They're affluent people.

224
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,040
They've got a lot of money.

225
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,630
What if they went to court?

226
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,396
What happens in the court, Papa?

227
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,160
Nothing...

228
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,600
I met my lawyer yesterday.

229
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,450
I talked to him.

230
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,930
He said

231
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,650
That I won't be able to fight them,

232
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,920
That I'd lose.

233
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,150
So you're afraid of them?

234
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,860
I don't.

235
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,000
If he came before me, I'd say, 'You're a dirty man'.

236
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,040
Don't be stubborn.

237
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,487
Please, Rumi.

238
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:48,670
You don't understand how powerful he is.

239
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,930
He's given me two days.

240
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,130
If she comes,

241
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,890
Meet her.

242
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,090
Go along if she takes you.

243
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:01,350
Besides, it's not as if she's coming everyday.

244
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,610
Why are you laughing?

245
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,610
You're not my strength, Papa, you're my weakness.

246
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,826
It's time for my class; give me a hug.

247
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,530
I love you Papa.

248
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,461
I'd do as you say.

249
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,260
I love you too.

250
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,646
Get me some tea and bread, ol' chap.
-Right away, sir.

251
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,310
Why are you laughing?

252
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,297
You're not my strength, Papa, you're my weakness.

253
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:05,910
I give you two days.

254
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,750
The two of them should meet on the third day,

255
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,060
Or my lawyers will have your hide.

256
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,640
Surely, sir, you're alright?

257
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,720
Yes, I'm alright.

258
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,192
I'll get you some bread.

259
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,080
Alright.

260
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,790
I'll not be responsible for his next progress report.

261
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,320
Your child will remain timid,

262
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,923
And timid children never perform well.

263
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,920
Surely, sir, you're alright?

264
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,320
Yes, I'm alright.

265
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,760
4 parathas.
-In a moment!

266
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,430
The protest will go on, M. Mehdi.

267
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,520
Whatever does the bugger think he is?

268
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,450
The share will drop to its face value

269
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,650
If the unit remains shut for a few days.

270
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,630
He's an absolute scoundrel.

271
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,250
He buys people over from our side,

272
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,870
And pays them, but does not give us a raise.

273
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,450
Whoever gets sold this time won't be seen around again.

274
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,940
What's up, man?
-In a moment.

275
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,250
Do you know what's going on in the office?

276
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,830
He's after yet another woman these days.

277
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,990
She's the one he's been spending his riches on.

278
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,880
I've heard she was someone's wife.

279
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,000
He's gotten him to divorce her.

280
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,840
It's her, innit, Monsieur le Chairman,

281
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,784
It's her, innit, Monsieur le Chairman, the new board secretary?

282
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,420
Hey!

283
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,326
Yes?

284
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:37,803
Would you happen to have a matchstick?

285
00:23:37,803 --> 00:23:39,269
No, sir. Shall I get you one?

286
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,977
Leave it be if you don't have one.

287
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:42,980
Also...

288
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,565
Yes?

289
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,840
My 'wife'

290
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,410
Had come yesterday, right?

291
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,170
Last night?

292
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,039
Last night?
-Yes.

293
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:59,530
She's no longer my wife.

294
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,153
We're separated now.

295
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,980
She's divorced me.

296
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,310
Rumi's not gone with her, either.

297
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,830
I've got him in a boarding school.

298
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,220
Boarding, as in...

299
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,260
He stays at the school hostel.

300
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,081
Right, sir.

301
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,836
I just wanted to tell you this.

302
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,977
Hello?

303
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,628
Hello...

304
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,581
Am I speaking to Madame Atiya Munir?

305
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:34,662
Yes?

306
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:36,674
It's Danish here.

307
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,128
Rumi's father.

308
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:39,394
Danish Akhtar.

309
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,568
Pray tell?

310
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:43,410
Could you get me through to Rumi?

311
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,910
In about 15 minutes.

312
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,800
He's just gotten up and gone to freshen up.

313
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,830
Okay, fine.

314
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,740
I'll call after 15 minutes.

315
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,643
It's your father-in-law.

316
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,660
Yes, Mr Danish?

317
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,390
I hope I'm not disturbing you?

318
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,160
No.

319
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,080
Pray tell. What is it?

320
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,680
Yesterday,

321
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,690
You'd said rather angrily that you won't be responsible for Rumi.

322
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,700
It upset me very much.

323
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,040
But

324
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,770
Know what,

325
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,910
I've decided to be a brave man.

326
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,130
What'd you do as a brave man?

327
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,790
I'd ask Rumi not to meet his mother just because I'm forcing him.

328
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,980
It's up to him

329
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,730
If he wants to meet her or not.

330
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,280
When would you tell him?

331
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,160
What?

332
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,170
When would you say this to Rumi?

333
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,950
I'd called Rumi just now.

334
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,440
His warden said he'd just gotten up.

335
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,150
Gone to freshen up.

336
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,570
I'll call him again right after talking to you.

337
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,860
Okay, I'll disconnect.

338
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,191
Okay, I'll disconnect.
-No, wait a minute.

339
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,516
Yes?

340
00:26:43,516 --> 00:26:45,990
Now that I've agreed to what the two of you had said,

341
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,840
Please leave the anger behind.

342
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,550
As in?

343
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,535
Please say that you'll be responsible for Rumi's performance.

344
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,560
You will be, right?

345
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,580
Of course I will.

346
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,950
Thank you so much.

347
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,510
It's okay.

348
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,975
Please, disconnect now.

349
00:27:07,721 --> 00:27:08,989
Bye.

350
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,521
Bye.

351
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,856
Why does he call you so much?

352
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,860
Because he's Dad's friend.

353
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,830
I found out from Dad's diary.

354
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,620
Dad used to love him so much.

355
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,700
And just a few days ago, he's discovered that I'm his son's teacher.

356
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,990
Fair enough.

357
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,050
But I think there's something else going on.

358
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,863
It's nothing like that.

359
00:27:55,863 --> 00:27:57,770
I've checked.

360
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,300
How?

361
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,600
He

362
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,190
Doesn't even look at me when he can very safely do so.

363
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,520
And when he does look at me, his eyes are just empty...

364
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,020
He puts up the show of a smile, deeply shocked inside...

365
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,580
Dad had even written, 'I've not him smile from within for the last few months',

366
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,690
But he's always the first one to smile.

367
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,970
Ask me why.

368
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,970
Why?

369
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:29,344
His wife's extinguished his smile.

370
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:37,090
Dad had even written somewhere, 'Pity the smile of a man who's begun to suspect his wife'.

371
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,330
Strange, innit?

372
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,270
Sometimes, I feel that a man

373
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,050
Who looks fine and strong from the outside

374
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,830
Is but like a bubble of water from within.

375
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:54,790
A single misstep of a woman can burst him.

376
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,850
Dad used to say,

377
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:02,080
'It makes me laugh when a woman doubts a man',

378
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,690
'But it makes me cry when a man doubts a woman'.

379
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,910
How does she look?

380
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,650
How does she look?
-Botheringly beautiful.

381
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm saying it, she <i>is</i> beautiful.

382
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,350
Otherwise, a woman with no sense of shame is not beautiful.

383
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,050
Then, put it plainly, will you?

384
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,580
She's not beautiful.

385
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,276
She's a bother.

386
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,980
He'd agree by the day after tomorrow, right?

387
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,761
Who?

388
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:42,440
Please, Mehwish...

389
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,110
Or, you can tell me where I should take you

390
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,590
To make you forget this headache.

391
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,820
Didn't I say it before you?

392
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,020
'They should meet by the day after tomorrow',

393
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,990
'Or my lawyers will tear you apart'.

394
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,570
Still, you can't believe it...

395
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,610
You've not threatened him.

396
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,070
I have.

397
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,660
And when I say something, I mean it.

398
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,360
Okay, I'm sorry.

399
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,890
I know him, though,

400
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,579
He's a proper coward.

401
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,930
He can't sleep all night if someone threatens him.

402
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,669
He'd get up to drink water every now and then.

403
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,090
Sorry...

404
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,920
Hello, Papa.

405
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,070
Hey, Rumi!

406
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,880
You'd gone to bed so early!

407
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,300
You're fine, right?

408
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,755
Yes, Papa.

409
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,770
Are you angry with me?

410
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,290
Why? Why would I be angry with you?

411
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,140
Oh?

412
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,330
Why had you said, then,

413
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,970
'Papa, you're not my strength'.

414
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,243
You'd said it too, Papa,

415
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:58,995
'Rumi, you're not my strength; you're my weakness'.

416
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,720
Why are you laughing?

417
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,380
You wouldn't believe it.

418
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,490
You'd think Papa's lying to you.

419
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,920
No. My Papa never lies.

420
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,680
Then, listen to this -

421
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,610
I'm your strength.

422
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:15,530
I'm not your weakness.

423
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:18,347
You don't believe it, do you?

424
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:20,550
You're joking, Papa.

425
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,380
Just ask me why I'm saying it.

426
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,170
Why?

427
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,320
Because I've decided

428
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,350
That it's up to you whether you want to meet your Maman

429
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,450
Or not.

430
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,160
I won't decide that.

431
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,860
What'd it do to them, Papa?

432
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,650
They're very rich. They'd bother you.

433
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,060
Just let them.

434
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,500
You'll see how I'll bother them.

435
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,580
You're underestimating your Papa.

436
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,980
Really?

437
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,180
Just wait and watch.

438
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,919
I'd break the bugger's face.

439
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:50,910
Why are you laughing now?

440
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,600
Because you're my strength, Papa.

441
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,599
You are my strength.

442
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,440
Good morning.

443
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I was just waiting for your call.

444
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,070
So, what have you decided?

445
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,200
I'm coming there.

446
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,400
Why?

447
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,280
I thought we'd sit and talk to decide everything,

448
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,140
So that there's no problem later.

449
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,420
Why, sure, then, come.

450
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,397
I'll be there in half an hour.

451
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,980
Good morning, M. Danish!

452
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,230
Good morning!

453
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,360
You look so dashing!

454
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,810
It's been a long while since I saw you like this.

455
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,720
You could just as well buy a car now.

456
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,880
This suit and glasses...

457
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,840
And a car would suit you very well.

458
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,914
Thank you.

459
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,940
Yes, he's coming.

460
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,870
He said, 'Let's resolve this issue'.

461
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,820
Alright, don't call me. I'll be in a meeting.

462
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,100
Alright, listen.

463
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Yes?

464
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,310
I forgot to say something.

465
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,600
Yes?

466
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,830
I love you.

467
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,986
Me too.

468
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,430
Right, what was I saying?

469
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,810
2.65 Rupees two days ago,

470
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,120
4.40 Rupees yesterday,

471
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,080
And then, the share's dropped by 2 Rupees when the market opened today?

472
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,230
And then, the share's dropped by 2 Rupees when the market opened today?
-Yes, sir.

473
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,135
That's it?

474
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:51,300
Just a 'Yes, sir' would do the job?

475
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,850
What are you here for

476
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,750
If I'd fuss over everything from the share price to the production at the plant?

477
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,420
Just getting paid for doing nothing, are you?

478
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,600
Excuse me, sir, but I'd told you that the union had called a strike yesterday.

479
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,991
They'd been staging a symbolic protest for 2 hours every day for the last 15 days.

480
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:12,770
If there's no work going on for 2 hours, the plant works at 75% efficiency.

481
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,310
Word gets out to the market and it's discussed among the stakeholders.

482
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,100
Shut up...

483
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,730
With due respect, sir, a 'Shut up' won't do.

484
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,300
If we didn't revise their salaries this time,

485
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,500
We'd have to face the music.

486
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,270
The people are so furious this time

487
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,980
That you won't be able to buy them over.

488
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,470
Please, leave.

489
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,301
Please, show yourselves out.

490
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,043
Wait.

491
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,130
Tell me how raising the salaries would impact us.

492
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:47,980
I'll calculate it for you, sir.

493
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,110
Hi.

494
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,570
Hi, sir.

495
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,420
Danish.

496
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,340
I've got a meeting with your boss.

497
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,456
Just a minute, sir.

498
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,550
What is it?

499
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,850
Sir, M. Danish is here.

500
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,410
So what?

501
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,480
Have the bugger sit.

502
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,840
Have him wait no less than one hour.

503
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,096
Okay, sir.

504
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:31,080
Please, sit.

505
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,020
The boss is busy in a meeting.

506
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,860
Don't lie to me.

507
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,800
He's said, 'Have the bugger sit for one hour'.

508
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,520
Sir!

509
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,070
Wait, sir!

510
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,315
So, I say --

511
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,340
What is going on?

512
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,850
What is going on?

513
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,949
What the devil are you doing in my room?

514
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,937
How dare --

515
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,433
Keep sitting.

516
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:05,610
Sit down!

517
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,620
If anyone so much as moved a muscle,

518
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,468
If anyone so much as moved a muscle, he'd die by my hand!

519
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,050
Right, Shehwar Ahmed,

520
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,980
Chairman of Shehwar Chemicals,

521
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,308
We were to talk about something.

522
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,070
You don't know who you're messing with.

523
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:36,434
I'll make an example of you for every pleb like you to watch.

524
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:37,964
That's my line.

525
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,632
I'll say it today.

526
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,020
What are you looking at?

527
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,170
Call the police!

528
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,658
That's the bleedin' limit -- What are you doing!?

529
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:51,281
The police come in <i>after</i> the incident.

530
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:53,950
Let me create the incident.

531
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,610
But first, tell me,

532
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,560
Tell me!

533
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,150
Say whatever you want to!

534
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,249
Tell them all

535
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:02,360
What you'd said over the phone!

536
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,720
Spill the beans!

537
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,480
Easy there, M. Danish, let go of my collar.

538
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,426
Easy there, M. Danish, let go of my collar.
-Tell them all!

539
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:08,800
Why don't you say anything?

540
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,830
What'd your lawyers do to me if they didn't meet within two days, eh?

541
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,990
They'd have my hide?

542
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,930
Look.

543
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,870
I'm wearing a suit.

544
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:22,008
I figured I'd wear something nice before they have my hide.

545
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:25,920
Don't disturb me!

546
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,006
I'm in a meeting!

547
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,750
Come here.

548
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,804
What are you doing?

549
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:34,135
Danish -- Wh -- What is this?
-Here! Sit down!

550
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,810
Just pause and think for two minutes.

551
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,630
If you want to have my hide, you'd need your lawyers,

552
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,160
If you want to have my hide, you'd need your lawyers, or your hoodlums.

553
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,926
You'd call them. It'd take time.

554
00:38:43,926 --> 00:38:48,110
But I need only two minutes to expose you.

555
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,410
Look,

556
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,550
My ex-wife, who's with you today,

557
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,220
She's been sold.

558
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,450
You've bought her.

559
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,270
I said, 'Fine',

560
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,030
'What's sold belongs to the buyer'.

561
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,360
But now, you're talking about <i>my</i> son,

562
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,219
And my son is all that remains of my pride.

563
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,400
You said that your lawyers would blow me to bits.

564
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,374
You made a mistake there.

565
00:39:16,374 --> 00:39:21,720
You reminded me that I am my son's strength, not his weakness.

566
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,687
So, remember, Shehwar Ahmed,

567
00:39:23,687 --> 00:39:26,090
If you dared threaten me again,

568
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,810
Or tried to strike a deal with me about my son,

569
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,240
I'd drag you by this tie of yours,

570
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,500
And expose you before everyone for real.

571
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,570
This incident would benefit all of you, too.

572
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,960
He can't fire you now.

573
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,540
If he dares to shout at you,

574
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,280
Go and tell everyone

575
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,710
About what happened here today.

576
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,890
Understood?

577
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,400
Have a nice day,

578
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,481
Shehwar Ahmed.

579
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,510
Leave me alone.

580
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
