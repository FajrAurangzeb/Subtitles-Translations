1
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,916
Papa...

2
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,430
Please meet Maman for once.

3
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,417
She won't cut her vein again.

4
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:35,426
And I want to see my Mum alive.

5
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,466
Please, have your breakfast.

6
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:47,126
I just said it casually.

7
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:49,846
Please don't be angry.

8
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,796
No, I --

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,836
I've had my breakfast.

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,626
I could've gotten you half or even a million off if you hadn't been in such a hurry.

11
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:31,936
But if you would've delayed,

12
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:35,770
I could've paid a million or even a million and a half more.

13
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,970
Thank you.

14
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,000
'(The Late) Akhtar Ahmed'

15
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,426
Is the plaque up?

16
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,866
Yes.

17
00:01:46,637 --> 00:01:48,447
Here's your money.

18
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:49,278
Thank you.

19
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:51,400
Should I open the door, Ma'am?

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,030
No.

21
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,072
Has everything been cleaned?

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,542
Has everything been cleaned?
-Yes.

23
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:58,727
Alright, you may go.

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,306
We'll get him enrolled in the school.

25
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:09,546
The rapscallion spends his entire day watching cartoons.

26
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,776
Bad word, Papa.

27
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:14,417
Look at him speak English now.

28
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,726
'Very good, Papa',

29
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,196
'Have a nice day, Papa'.

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,286
Hello, Mehwish!

31
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,560
I hear you've bought this flat.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,056
Yes.

33
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,076
And

34
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:36,630
Who's this Akhtar Ahmed?

35
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,890
Danish's Dad.

36
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,390
Please, come.

37
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,506
Have some tea.

38
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,286
Not in that way.

39
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:45,430
I've gotten married.

40
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,696
I'm not alone now.

41
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:49,960
I'll have your tea

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,986
When I come to live here.

43
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:54,506
Won't Danish be coming?

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,106
How could he...

45
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:02,966
He lives in that grand mansion now...

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,366
Have you two sorted things out?

47
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,680
One sorts things after a quarrel, Monty,

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,136
But we never had a quarrel to begin with.

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,459
Hello.

50
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,206
Hi.

51
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,976
Ever imagined <i>we</i> could have a row?

52
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:50,880
Why are you laughing? Tell me.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,810
I won't tell you anything if you ask such questions.

54
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,220
Where's he?

55
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,430
In his room.

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,760
I asked him to come with me, but he's afraid of you.

57
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,040
Splendid.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,600
As if he could be afraid of me.

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm afraid of you, too, now.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm afraid of your silence.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,670
It feels like you'd burst into a cloud of smoke out of anger one day.

62
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,470
Shut up.

63
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,140
What are you saying!

64
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,630
Alright, promise me,

65
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:19,010
You'd keep smiling like this when I say something.

66
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,110
I'll keep smiling.

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,441
I've brought Mehwish over to my place from the hostel.

68
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,136
Take good care of her.

69
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,720
Where are you off to?

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,296
Outside.

71
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:43,659
I'm afraid the two of you may begin to justify disloyalty.

72
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,620
And remember, Ayesha,

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,940
Even animals would laugh

74
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,920
If one ever found a defence for disloyalty.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,560
They'd write 'love' on someone's footprint

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,060
And display it at a museum,

77
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,670
And tell the visitors,

78
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,856
'There was a time when people used to be so stupid'.

79
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,930
You turned out to be so disloyal.

80
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,060
You don't miss me

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,880
Or talk to me...

82
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,746
I do miss you, but don't talk to you.

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,246
Why?

84
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,020
Nothing, really.

85
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,120
What good would be missing you if you got married to someone else?

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,480
Splendid.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,710
Who'd you get me married off to <i>this time</i>?

88
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,261
I'd wanted to get you married to Papa, but that ain't possible now.

89
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,890
Now, I want that you stay away from him.

90
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,941
I'm so mean...

91
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,522
I'm so mean... Innit?

92
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,903
Yeah.

93
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:10,313
But I'm angry at my meanness.

94
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:12,293
Don't be angry.

95
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,043
I'd stay away from him.

96
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:18,104
Please, have some.

97
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,515
Teacher!

98
00:06:21,676 --> 00:06:23,206
Teacher!

99
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,550
What did he say?

100
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,540
He said, 'Take good care of her', got up, and left.

101
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,560
Where'd he go?

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,536
Outside.

103
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,820
He said, 'I'm afraid of you two'.

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,730
Afraid, as in?

105
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,096
Anyway, just relax.

106
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,066
He'll be fine.

107
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:51,813
Please, tell me, Ayesha.

108
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,266
Why was he scared?

109
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:56,776
He felt we were justifying disloyalty.

110
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,671
He's right there.

111
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,260
He doesn't want to see my face

112
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,909
Or meet me.

113
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:13,226
Know what, I thought if I'd slit my wrist,

114
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,720
It'd torment him somewhere.

115
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,720
I felt it'd tormented him when he'd come to the hospital,

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,630
But realised when he'd left

117
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,673
That he'd come to torment me.

118
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,230
Just don't die with this hope.

119
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,960
I doubt he'd even come to see you.

120
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,396
Just sit and wait.

121
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:42,526
My heart says that he'd meet you one day.

122
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:46,616
Then, he won't be able to leave you.

123
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:51,153
Stay here if you want to talk about all of this.

124
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,086
It'd keep me busy.

125
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,086
Know what, I want to fight him too on this.

126
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:57,170
I want to convince him

127
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,210
That disloyalty may be a sin,

128
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,666
But there's something called penance, too.

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,096
I've bought that flat today.

130
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:12,000
Which flat?

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
The one we used to live in together.

132
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,426
With the money Shehwar gave you?

133
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,250
I thought I'd buy it.

134
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,440
He can give the money to have it transferred over to him.

135
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,510
Didn't you think why he didn't buy the flat himself?

136
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,070
Why?

137
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,960
He said, 'I don't even come close to <i>that building</i>'.

138
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,470
'I'd die if I went inside the flat'.

139
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,960
'Shehwar Ahmed's footprints lie within',

140
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,746
'And the stench of days spent with a two-timer fills the air'.

141
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,147
Why don't you play with me?

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,186
What kind of question is that?

143
00:09:29,186 --> 00:09:33,587
You've changed since you've gotten rich, Papa.

144
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,096
Oh, please...

145
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:41,020
You do meet my teacher, don't you?

146
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,380
Don't hide. We're friends.

147
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,220
No, my friend.

148
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,920
I don't meet her,

149
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,100
Nor have I got anything going on.

150
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,800
You know, I'm proud of you, Papa.

151
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
You're lying.

152
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,787
Please don't.

153
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,289
Do you know why?

154
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:57,507
Why?

155
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:01,026
There's something going on in her heart.

156
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,760
Do you remember how old you are?

157
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,900
Yeah.

158
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,340
Have some shame.

159
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,706
These aren't things you should be talking about.

160
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:11,237
Wait, Papa.

161
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,570
Yes?

162
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,516
I can't give my Papa to anyone.

163
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,480
Don't worry.

164
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,316
Your Papa is only yours.

165
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,620
You do play quite well.

166
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,230
You've beaten me just now, haven't you?

167
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,226
Do you know why?

168
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,326
Why?

169
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:36,126
You don't want to beat me.

170
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,266
See you at dinner.

171
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,300
He says, 'See you at dinner'.

172
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:01,360
Know what...

173
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,926
What?

174
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:05,397
He's lying to you.

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,016
Actually, he's told you that there's something going on in <i>your</i> heart.

176
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,230
C'mon, mate...

177
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,326
Keep it simple, will you?

178
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:16,836
Go to Hania and say, 'Will you marry me'?

179
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,496
Shut up!

180
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:24,150
Or, come to my place.

181
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,980
Just think she'd gotten off her train at the wrong place.

182
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,850
The train left,

183
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,580
And she realised it wasn't her destination.

184
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,330
She's standing there, waiting.

185
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,766
Forgive her mistake and bring her back.

186
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,990
Hung up?

187
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,586
Yes.

188
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,276
And he said,

189
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:08,070
'I wanted you to',

190
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,980
'But now I want you to stay away from Papa'.

191
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,360
Blimey...

192
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,476
He said, 'I'm so mean, ain't I'?

193
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,366
Blimey, such a wee kid,

194
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:19,497
Saying such things. He even sai --
-Stop it, Hania.

195
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:21,810
You're laughing too much.

196
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,400
I get a feeling it's a new way of crying buckets.

197
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,776
Dinner's ready. Come.

198
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:31,790
Although one doesn't really feel hungry in such a situation.

199
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,911
Wait.

200
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,730
If I was laughing, it doesn't mean I was actually crying.

201
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,326
But I can cry for him, too.

202
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,030
And, because I don't love him,

203
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,500
It's true that I don't.

204
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,570
But I could as well be in love with him.

205
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:10,170
What I don't get is whether it's proper for someone who's loved so intensely the first time to love a second time,

206
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,986
And if it is proper, whatever is he left with to give this second time?

207
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,980
Come, let's have dinner. I'm starving.

208
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,970
What's a divorce, Maman?

209
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,960
Maman and Papa no longer remain friends?

210
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,160
And Maman leaves?

211
00:13:41,346 --> 00:13:43,876
What happens then?

212
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,820
Don't ask that, Rumi.

213
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,550
You won't get it.

214
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm the only one who's understood it, Maman.

215
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Everyone gets separated from everyone when Maman's left.

216
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,020
Please don't say such big words, Rumi.

217
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,960
Papa says the same - that I say big words now.

218
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,006
The two of you have made me grow far beyond my years.

219
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,437
Please, Maman,

220
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:11,758
I don't want to grow up just yet.

221
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,500
Get me through to your Papa.

222
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,326
He won't talk now.

223
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,990
Just ask him.

224
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,921
Just for once?

225
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,976
Won't you have dinner?

226
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,350
I'm talking to Maman.

227
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,800
Wait, Papa...

228
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,430
Maman wants to talk to you.

229
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,802
She's requesting.

230
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,626
He left with an angry look.

231
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,326
Alright, I'll go have my dinner.

232
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,391
Call your Maman.

233
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,706
Listen...

234
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,880
If you didn't get him,

235
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,440
Remember,

236
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,410
You'd miss him a lot.

237
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,730
And it's very improper of a woman

238
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,960
To marry one

239
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,766
And miss another.

240
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,376
You might as well die for him.

241
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:13,636
No.

242
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:17,610
I love to see how you might even die for him.

243
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,430
Mum used to say, 'When a woman repeatedly says that she dislikes someone',

244
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,020
'She's actually begun to like him'.

245
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,460
And when someone like you says, 'Whatever is left',

246
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,240
She actually wants to know

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,907
If there's anything left at all.

248
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,980
Embarrassed already?

249
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,580
Come.

250
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,404
Please, come in.

251
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,970
Call out to him.

252
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,917
Whom?

253
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,436
M. Diwan.

254
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,180
You used to call out to him the moment you entered.

255
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,970
M. Diwan!

256
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,461
M. Diwan!

257
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,861
He didn't come.

258
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,951
He's not coming.

259
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:54,471
His wife has a fever. He said he'd be with her tonight.

260
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,310
But

261
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,870
Now that you've come back,

262
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,427
I thought I'd give you your pride back.

263
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,300
Whether or not someone comes,

264
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,620
Just keep calling out, okay?

265
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,520
Honestly,

266
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,560
Have you grown fond of me, or are you having mercy on me?

267
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,630
Come. I'll tell you.

268
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,666
Here.

269
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,477
Sit here.

270
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,262
Please, sit down.

271
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,480
I've begun to believe you're a man.

272
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
Mum used to say, 'He's made men and women in pairs'.

273
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,450
'You find another when you've separated from one'.

274
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,600
I figured

275
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,740
That if I have to find another man after separating from you,

276
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,114
Are you so bad yourself?

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,006
Play it, will you?

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,440
I've heard

279
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,820
That you

280
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,196
Played the piano for Mehwish one night.

281
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,671
You danced with her late into the night.

282
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,950
Play the same tune today, will you?

283
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,366
Just forget Mehwish, will you?

284
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,368
Have you?

285
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:31,666
I have.

286
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,407
A lie.

287
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,906
Remember her so you can forget her.

288
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,809
You've got to remember someone to forget them.

289
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:44,323
Play the same tune.

290
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:48,774
Let us remember her together to forget her.

291
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,696
How do you like it?

292
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:35,686
Very good.

293
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:37,804
What?

294
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,086
Dancing with you.

295
00:21:42,488 --> 00:21:44,378
Not dancing.

296
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,766
Getting out of your cage at the lockup.

297
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,906
Finding what was lost again.

298
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,956
Honestly, Maham?

299
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,390
I can't believe it.

300
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,586
I can't believe it either.

301
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:11,386
You'd gone to Europe with her, too?

302
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:17,250
For two and a half months,

303
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,980
You've danced about in someone else's arms,

304
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,730
Intoxicated with another woman?

305
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,260
I'll apologise after the dance.

306
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,950
No.

307
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,580
Not just <i>yet</i>.

308
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,757
Apologise after a few years.

309
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,040
Right now,

310
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,926
You're on probation for this new relationship.

311
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,560
Someday,

312
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,450
I'll call out to you as I leave,

313
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,166
Saying, 'I forgive you, Shehwar'.

314
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:00,006
'You've become the chairman of the Shehwar group of companies again'.

315
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,800
Until your period of probation is over,

316
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,856
You're not our chairman.

317
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:22,390
From now on, you'd sit in the same chair, in the same room

318
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,650
Where I'd seen you work with all your heart,

319
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,340
Seeing which, I'd lost my heart to you.

320
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,446
I've begun to fear him, Mehwish.

321
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,496
He's trying to break me.

322
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,270
Thinking that divorce is some trifling crossness between two people,

323
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,670
He says, 'Why don't the two of you sort things out'?

324
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,100
Yes, why don't we sort things out?

325
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,846
Why don't you just agree to what he says?

326
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,956
Alright.

327
00:24:33,956 --> 00:24:36,290
Just act out a reconciliation.

328
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,900
Give me a place to stay in a corner of the house.

329
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,290
We'd have dinner together to show him,

330
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,660
Play with him,

331
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,986
And show him that we've not separated.

332
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,100
Soon,

333
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,330
He'd have grown up enough to understand the meaning of divorce.

334
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,640
He may even say himself,

335
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,510
'Why do the two of you live together'?

336
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,609
You're there, aren't you?

337
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:14,446
Even if he understood, he'd never say,

338
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,226
'Why are you living together'?

339
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:19,947
Alright, even if he doesn't say it, I'd leave myself.

340
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,436
You're laughing?

341
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:29,930
Because you're talking about leaving.

342
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,796
Of course, you know about leaving only too well...

343
00:25:34,996 --> 00:25:38,490
I wish you talk about it all over again,

344
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,570
And I die when I hear it.

345
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,560
You've brought tears to my eyes,

346
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,125
And I wouldn't like to cry over you.

347
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,090
<i>Of vexed hearts,</i>

348
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,340
<i>The path is straight</i>

349
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,507
<i>Never is it</i>

350
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:14,217
<i>That they look back.</i>

351
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:17,243
<i>The strands of love,</i>

352
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,500
<i>The bond of loyalty</i>

353
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:28,269
<i>Once broken, can never be mended...</i>

354
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,040
Thank you, Papa!

355
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,000
Thank you for what?

356
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,830
You've come to drop me at school. After a month!

357
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,500
Mind yourself, laddie. I'd be coming everyday now.

358
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,656
Then, just say that you've minded yourself!

359
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,130
Go.

360
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,400
Bye, Papa.

361
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,956
Bye.

362
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,110
Close the door.

363
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,910
Hi, teacher!

364
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,306
Let's get going.

365
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,096
Papa would come everyday now.

366
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:33,176
Earlier, Papa would just send me with the driver.

367
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,606
Your classroom.

368
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,486
Are you angry with me?

369
00:27:41,486 --> 00:27:42,946
Of course not.

370
00:27:42,946 --> 00:27:45,987
Why did you leave my hand, then?

371
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,090
This is not my classroom.

372
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,334
Oh...

373
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,045
I'm sorry.

374
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,074
See you.

375
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,686
See you.

376
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,840
Yes, Watira?

377
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,296
Did you see him?

378
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:02,930
Whom?

379
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,809
Danish, of course.

380
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,596
Don't be cheap.

381
00:28:06,596 --> 00:28:07,686
Cheap?

382
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,620
He knows you, you know him.

383
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,986
But you know neither me, nor him.

384
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:13,736
But I'd said 'Hi',

385
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:15,800
And waved, too.

386
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,460
Thank God...

387
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,426
Thank God?

388
00:28:18,426 --> 00:28:19,960
What?

389
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,660
Polar bear...

390
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,560
Polar bear is the most endangered animal.

391
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,476
Do you know

392
00:28:28,476 --> 00:28:32,367
Which one is the second most endangered animal?

393
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,720
Rumi?

394
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,459
Are you here?

395
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:44,849
No, I'm not.

396
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,960
I'm sorry.

397
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,730
Is there any problem?

398
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,880
Yes.

399
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,530
But I'm thinking about the solution.

400
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,810
You?

401
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,456
Yeah.

402
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:57,106
Think after the class.

403
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:59,891
Okay, fine, teacher.

404
00:28:59,891 --> 00:29:01,716
Right, where was I?

405
00:29:01,716 --> 00:29:05,776
You were saying that the polar bear is the most endangered animal.

406
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,220
Correct.

407
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,756
So...

408
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,320
Know what,

409
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,720
I can't look him in the eye now.

410
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,640
I feel like I'm looking at my Dad.

411
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,490
Seriously, mate.

412
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,850
I used to fear Dad a lot.

413
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,340
He'd get angry

414
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,150
At the slightest mistake.

415
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,160
He'd say, 'I'm going easy on you for now'.

416
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,327
After saying something sharp, he'd say, 'Where's your sense of humour now'?

417
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:35,168
So, what's new about that?

418
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,488
After so many months,

419
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:40,109
I'd gone to drop him at the school today.

420
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,949
He said as he got off,

421
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,388
'Thank you, Papa'.

422
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:45,029
So, what's the big deal?

423
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,268
That's what you don't know.

424
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:48,960
It was the same with Dad.

425
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,270
His 'Thank you' sounded like an insult.

426
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,026
His 'Thank you' sounded like an insult.
-Thank you.

427
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:55,490
When he got off the car,

428
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,510
Hania showed up.

429
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,988
Hania said, 'Hi',

430
00:29:58,988 --> 00:30:00,630
And - blimey - how the little bugger was looking at her!

431
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,806
And - blimey - how the little bugger was looking at her! Then at me, then her again.
-How?

432
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:03,876
And - blimey - how the little bugger was looking at her! Then at me, then her again.
-How was he looking at her?

433
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:05,710
Just try to understand it.

434
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,040
As if Dad's looking at her.

435
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,980
As if --

436
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm hitting on her.

437
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,680
Alright, leave Dad be.

438
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,310
If he was looking at her like that, it means he knows everything.

439
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,400
What does he know?

440
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,530
He must've seen <i>something</i>.

441
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,530
Seen -- where?

442
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,710
In Hania's heart.

443
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,020
In her words.

444
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,100
He's at school for 6 hours.

445
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,220
She's got 4 classes with her.

446
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,200
They must have talked sometime.

447
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,150
She'd have said everything, thinking of him as just a kid.

448
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,730
She'd have said everything, thinking of him as just a kid.
-What 'everything', mate?

449
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,500
What's there between the two of us?

450
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,150
Who's talking about the two of you?

451
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,600
Only the open book gets read.

452
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,466
You've sealed yourself shut.

453
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,936
He's her student.

454
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:46,626
He might've read her.

455
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,580
Latif! Get me a cup of tea.

456
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,760
Hi, Papa! Good evening.

457
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,586
Good evening.

458
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,016
Going somewhere?

459
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,606
Yeah.

460
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,280
I'm going to meet Hania.

461
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,747
Why?

462
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:27,726
Nothing, really. I thought I'd meet her.

463
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:29,141
Where'd you meet her?

464
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:30,496
At her place.

465
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:31,980
At her place. Of course.

466
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,590
You didn't even ask me.

467
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,056
Oh -- My mistake...

468
00:31:37,476 --> 00:31:40,277
Alright, may I go?

469
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,416
May I come along?

470
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:44,820
C'mon, Papa. It'd be suspicious if you came along.

471
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,960
Who'd grow suspicious?

472
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,426
What's it with suspicion, Papa?

473
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:49,640
I may grow suspicious, too.

474
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,870
May I?

475
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,286
See you at dinner.

476
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,816
Bye!

477
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,298
Bye.

478
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,320
Hello?

479
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,840
Hello.

480
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,590
It's Danish.

481
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,106
Yes?

482
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,190
Did you call Rumi?

483
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,340
No?

484
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,976
He called. Said, 'I'm coming'. I said, 'Alright'.

485
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:54,896
Didn't you ask him why he's coming?

486
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:56,006
Why?

487
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:57,937
Why would I ask that?

488
00:32:57,937 --> 00:32:59,616
You'd come, too.

489
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:02,570
Did I ask you why you were coming?

490
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,620
No, it's nothing like that.

491
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,100
I was just worried about him.

492
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,830
He's up to some fresh tricks.

493
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,970
Anyway...

494
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,520
Listen...

495
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,780
Yes?

496
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,410
What fresh tricks?

497
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,050
I mean --

498
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,750
Exactly --

499
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,466
Can't tell exactly...

500
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,400
Don't worry.

501
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm his teacher, not his student.

502
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,950
I'm his teacher, not his student. I'll take care.

503
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,321
Okay.

504
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,818
Send him back.

505
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:28,560
Sure.

506
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,926
Bye.

507
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,876
It's Danish.

508
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,896
Yes?

509
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,260
What's going on, Salman?

510
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,740
What's going on?

511
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,700
Rumi, mate...

512
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,110
He's gone to meet Hania so royally decked up as if --

513
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,620
He didn't even ask me.

514
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,340
You're suspecting him?

515
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,500
Oh, please, mate...

516
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,536
He's gone on a date, boyo. Simple.

517
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm serious, Salman.

518
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,750
Let me have dinner.

519
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,160
I mean, I'll think seriously after dinner.

520
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,950
I'll tell you why he's gone there.

521
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,967
Go to hell...

522
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,426
Guess

523
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:24,471
What's bothering him.

524
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:30,076
Rumi's gone to meet Hania decked up and all -- And he didn't even ask him.

525
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,856
Excuse me.

526
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,774
We'd decided we're friends, right?

527
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:52,621
Yes, we are friends.

528
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,760
So I can talk to you about anything?

529
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,560
Don't you remember you talk to me about everything?

530
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,126
I was just checking your memory.

531
00:35:03,596 --> 00:35:08,546
But what I'm about to say is the most important of it all, teacher.

532
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:11,856
Very serious.

533
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:12,927
May I?

534
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,006
Yes, go on.

535
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:17,557
May I hold your hand?

536
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,136
Yeah, sure...

537
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,190
Please, get up from the chair, will you?

538
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:44,120
Will you marry my father?

539
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,460
Come here right away if you haven't had dinner.

540
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,736
I've been waiting.

541
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:14,022
I haven't had dinner.

542
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:17,290
I'd promised I'd have dinner with you.

543
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,066
Good boy.

544
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,296
Actually, you weren't waiting to have dinner.

545
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:29,117
You couldn't bring yourself to eat.

546
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:30,916
Why?

547
00:36:31,077 --> 00:36:33,560
All the suspense...

548
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,876
What suspense?

549
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,180
I'd gone to Miss Hania's.

550
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,840
You must be thinking why I'd gone there.

551
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,156
Shall we have dinner?

552
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,870
So, no suspense?

553
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,786
No suspense.

554
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,000
Why'd you gone there?

555
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,180
I'd gone to convince her.

556
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,790
I said, 'Get married'.

557
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,277
I proposed to her.

558
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:13,788
What?

559
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,596
<i>You</i> proposed to <i>her</i>?

560
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:17,760
What did she say?

561
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,206
Look at your age!

562
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:23,440
Why are you so rude?

563
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,937
No, Papa, I was just saying it lightly.

564
00:37:26,937 --> 00:37:31,208
You'd hug me if you heard what I've done.

565
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,630
What've you done?

566
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,976
I've talked about the marriage, ol' chap.

567
00:37:35,976 --> 00:37:37,787
I seized her hand,

568
00:37:37,787 --> 00:37:38,810
And said,

569
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:41,666
'Will you marry my father'?

570
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,016
At least have your dinner, Papa!

571
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,046
Why are you shying away?

572
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,096
Papa...

573
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,381
You're laughing?

574
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:28,860
I thought you'd be angry with me.

575
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,580
No way.

576
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,380
I'm delighted.

577
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,800
I feel so good.

578
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,870
You're taking so much interest in my life.

579
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:39,996
Are you joking?

580
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:41,776
No way, mate.

581
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm complimenting you.

582
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,980
Go and call your Maman.

583
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,620
Say, 'I've found a match for Papa, and I will not rest until I've gotten them married'.

584
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,640
She'd be chuffed to hear that.

585
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,960
She'd give you a kiss.

586
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,710
No, she won't be happy to hear that.

587
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,500
She'd cry, but say, 'Splendid. Well done, Rumi'!

588
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,420
Then, go and tell her. Hear her compliments, too.

589
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,410
I already did.

590
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,596
I've already told her.

591
00:39:04,596 --> 00:39:07,456
I'd called her on the way.

592
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,270
She said, 'Go and ask Papa'.

593
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,372
Alright, I'll ask tomorrow. Have your dinner.

594
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:21,576
I'm starving.

595
00:39:22,936 --> 00:39:24,656
You're starving?

596
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,690
C'mon.

597
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,646
Let's have dinner.

598
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
