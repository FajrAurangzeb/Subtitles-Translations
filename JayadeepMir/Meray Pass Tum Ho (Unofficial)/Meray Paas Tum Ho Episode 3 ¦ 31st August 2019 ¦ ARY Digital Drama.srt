1
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,330
May I have this dance?

2
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,990
I know your husband doesn't like it,

3
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,760
But I want to.

4
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,050
I'm sorry,

5
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,880
But I can't.

6
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,590
Trust me,

7
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,760
My intentions aren't bad.

8
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,000
It --

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,940
It wouldn't exactly please my husband.

10
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,534
Okay.

11
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:30,158
Listen.

12
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:31,175
Please

13
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,575
Don't mind it.

14
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:35,394
Don't say that.

15
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:37,128
One who goes through

16
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:42,096
Such a heartbreak would mind it.

17
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,676
What was he saying?

18
00:02:09,676 --> 00:02:11,078
Nothing?

19
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:14,326
He asked, 'Where's your husband gone'?

20
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,799
And?

21
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,318
And what?

22
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,162
He just said, 'Why aren't you and your husband dancing'?

23
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:25,188
I said -- that you can't dance.

24
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,836
I can't dance?

25
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,160
Of course you can.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,910
I just said it to get rid of him.

27
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,437
Get up.

28
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:52,924
Come.

29
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:53,691
Where?

30
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:55,674
It's time to dance.

31
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,106
No, Danish!

32
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,439
Everybody's dancing; let's join in! Come.

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,423
And you sit here.

34
00:03:00,423 --> 00:03:02,331
Don't budge. Okay?

35
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:04,540
Rumi?

36
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:58,412
Don't worry.

37
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:01,242
Your husband's busy now.

38
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,326
When did you get married?

39
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:15,264
It's been 7 years.

40
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:16,749
What does your husband do?

41
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:17,593
He's --

42
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:21,333
He works at an office of the Government.

43
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:23,320
Was it a 'love marriage'?

44
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,333
Yes.

45
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,156
Why aren't you particularly happy, then?

46
00:04:29,156 --> 00:04:30,721
It happens...

47
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,280
I used to feel the same way in the beginning too,

48
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,452
That I have everything now that I've got her.

49
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:40,092
But it only took me a year to realise

50
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:43,440
That I'd actually lost everything.

51
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,873
But I'm okay.

52
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,780
Perfectly fine.

53
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,964
That's just what I say

54
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:53,194
If someone asks me.

55
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:57,227
After all, one's got to maintain one's esteem.

56
00:04:57,227 --> 00:05:00,068
They say

57
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,094
That matches are made in Heaven.

58
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,022
I don't believe it.

59
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,679
People do something stupid themselves,

60
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:09,889
And throw the blame on the Lord.

61
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,680
Excuse me.

62
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,237
Come.

63
00:05:52,923 --> 00:05:53,979
Danish?

64
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,600
Let's go home, shall we?

65
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,930
Pick up your bag.

66
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,132
Come, Rumi.

67
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,886
Care to tell me what happened?

68
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,647
Don't ask anything until we're home.

69
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:02,370
Please.

70
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,585
Danish!

71
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:04,339
Mehwish!

72
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,512
Where are you off to?

73
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,730
The thing is, I'm not feeling well.

74
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,246
We'll be there at the wedding tomorrow.

75
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:14,707
Let's get going.

76
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,881
Ah, right.

77
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:19,043
Take out the money.

78
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,880
Here's your 80,000.

79
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,029
I got late and she had to borrow it from you

80
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,071
To buy the necklace.

81
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,539
But thank you so much.

82
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,233
C'mon.

83
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,670
See you at the wedding tomorrow.

84
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,342
Bye.

85
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,568
Come.

86
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,690
Just there.

87
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,203
Alright, go to bed.

88
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:23,728
I'm hungry, Maman.

89
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:26,133
Ask your Papa to cook an omelette.

90
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,462
Wait, Mehwish.

91
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,025
You're being furious at me

92
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,182
Over what you should be ashamed at?

93
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:34,908
What have I done that's shameless?

94
00:07:34,908 --> 00:07:36,214
Stop it, Mehwish.

95
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,496
You know what you've done.

96
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:39,151
You were doing the same.

97
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:42,285
Weren't you dancing with your arms around Anoushay's waist?

98
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:43,449
Anoushay is like a sister to me.

99
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:46,478
As if he's my boyfriend!
-Stop it, Mehwish!

100
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,572
Shut up!

101
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:35,966
I know you must've done it to show your jovialty.

102
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:36,682
But --

103
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,137
It was a mistake, wasn't it?

104
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:52,102
Would it not infuriate me?

105
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:54,976
It's very natural.

106
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:57,193
Would the agony of it not kill me

107
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:02,490
If someone put his arms around my wife's waist?

108
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,055
These --

109
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:04,789
These hands,

110
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,585
These arms --

111
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:10,414
This waist -- all of it is mine.

112
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:13,030
I know I'm possessive.

113
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,037
Very possessive.

114
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:20,239
But does this love mean anything without possessiveness?
-Whatever!

115
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,793
You shouldn't have come back.

116
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:24,834
That's what I thought best at the moment.

117
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,637
I felt as it --

118
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:28,256
I'd brought you --

119
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,397
To a lair of wolves!

120
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:33,156
I'm sorry, Mehwish.

121
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,762
I wasn't exactly fair on Anoushay,

122
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:39,930
But the truth is that it hasn't been fair on me either.

123
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,623
I'd -- gone there to enjoy, but have come back afraid.

124
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,633
I'm the one who's afraid, Danish.

125
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:48,032
And it pains me that I'm afraid of you!

126
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:51,336
This is so unfair.

127
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:54,367
Instead of being ashamed at your mistake, you're saying --

128
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,571
That you're afraid of me?
-Danish, please leave me alone.

129
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,188
Let me take a moment to understand what has just happened!

130
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:03,758
I feel like I've had a nightmare.

131
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,976
I've had a nightmare, too.

132
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:10,038
I'm scared too, Mehwish.

133
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:12,115
For the first time, I felt that you

134
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:16,133
Aren't so strong.

135
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:22,618
Amidst jovialty, you forget a woman's dignity.

136
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,221
Pause and think for once.

137
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:33,676
Whoever, in love, thinks about what others would say?

138
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,940
You should just think about

139
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,299
What I'd say.

140
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:48,913
I'm going to the market.

141
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:51,864
I'll get something to eat.

142
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:56,710
And I'm sorry for shouting at you angrily.

143
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:12,284
Was it a 'love marriage'?

144
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:15,449
Why aren't you particularly happy, then?

145
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:17,174
It happens...

146
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:19,721
I used to feel the same way in the beginning too,

147
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,032
That I have everything now that I've got her.

148
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:24,203
But it only took me a year to realise

149
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:26,448
That I'd actually lost everything.

150
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:28,245
They say

151
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:30,214
That matches are made in Heaven.

152
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,221
I don't believe it.

153
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,849
People do something stupid themselves,

154
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:38,043
And throw the blame on the Lord.

155
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:18,326
I'm sorry -- I --

156
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,546
It's you!

157
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:22,782
I was just thinking of you!

158
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:23,742
I mean, yes.

159
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,779
I just met you a short while ago.

160
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,749
Why did you leave?

161
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,265
I'm not feeling well...

162
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,967
I can see that.

163
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:38,232
Come, I'll get you --
-No. Thank you.

164
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:39,607
Thank you.

165
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:42,672
Please, don't trouble yourself. I don't think you're alright.

166
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:46,186
What makes you think that?

167
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:49,454
What's wrong with me?

168
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:50,622
I'm alright.

169
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:52,966
Perfectly alright.

170
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:56,122
Please, get going.

171
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:00,952
What are you looking at like that?

172
00:13:00,952 --> 00:13:03,719
Please, go.

173
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,844
Okay.

174
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:09,187
I'll get going.

175
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,788
Alright.

176
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:35,956
Now, finish this milk too.

177
00:13:43,175 --> 00:13:46,137
What happened to you?

178
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,791
I'm not --

179
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,336
Feeling well.

180
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:54,468
Get me in bed, please, I'm very sleepy.

181
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,489
Finish all of this, alright?

182
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,674
What happened?

183
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:39,753
People have a lot in this world.

184
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,551
Mansions,

185
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,878
Luxury cars...

186
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:49,019
They'd hire whoever they want to,

187
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,092
And buy whatever they want to.

188
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:59,487
But I don't care about any of it.

189
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:05,954
Bless them all with whatever they have,

190
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:13,015
But I know I have the most precious thing in the world.

191
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:17,935
The most beautiful,

192
00:15:17,935 --> 00:15:21,654
The most invaluable...

193
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,874
Ask what I have.

194
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:26,909
What do you have?

195
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:32,287
I have you, Mehwish.

196
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:35,769
I have you.

197
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,854
What happened to you last night?

198
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,067
Last night?

199
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:20,165
What had happened?

200
00:16:21,669 --> 00:16:23,416
Ah,

201
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,040
The thing about the dance.

202
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,884
Leave it be.

203
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,259
Forget it.

204
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:31,272
You'd forget it too, right?

205
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:33,297
I've already forgotten.

206
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,720
Do you think I'd remember?

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,343
Do you remember where you'd gone after we returned from the Mehendi?

208
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,050
The three of us?

209
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,079
Not the three of us.

210
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,298
Just you.

211
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:45,236
Nowhere?

212
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,988
I retired right after coming back, Mehwish.

213
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:54,239
Don't you remember how sleepy I was?

214
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:57,058
You're testing me!

215
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,002
We used to play such tricks in our younger days.

216
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:00,704
This isn't a trick, Danish.

217
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,423
You'd gone to the market to get something to eat last night,

218
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:07,579
Because we'd come back from the Mehendi without eating anything.

219
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,938
So I'd actually gone to the market.

220
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:15,978
I thought we'd had nothing last night.

221
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,256
Tell me, what did I get from the market?

222
00:17:18,256 --> 00:17:19,426
Nothing.

223
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,656
You came back empty-handed.

224
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,673
In fact, you came back panting

225
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:27,188
As if the sight of someone had frightened you.

226
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:29,760
Oh...

227
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,698
So it wasn't a dream after all!

228
00:17:31,698 --> 00:17:33,563
Dream?

229
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:35,639
No, I remember now.

230
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:39,048
I'd gone to get something to eat...

231
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:43,018
What happend next?

232
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:46,299
Right...

233
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,174
I was just about to get there when a car bumped into me.

234
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,642
No, it didn't bump into me.

235
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:55,144
I felt it'd bumped into me, and I'd fallen down.

236
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,190
That's why --

237
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,049
I was frightened.

238
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,159
And you know what,

239
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,049
I ran away sharpish as if he'd eat me alive!

240
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:04,883
Who?

241
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,035
The driver.

242
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:08,142
He came over

243
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:11,693
To pick a fight with me.

244
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:15,551
But I didn't pick a fight with him.

245
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,799
So it wasn't a dream after all...

246
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,724
Rumi --

247
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,659
Must've fallen asleep hungry.

248
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:23,466
No,

249
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:26,050
I gave him some milk.

250
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,873
Good.

251
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,592
So I'd actually gone to the market...

252
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,654
So it wasn't a dream after all...

253
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,309
What are you cooking today?

254
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,936
Whatever you say.

255
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,063
Biryani, qorma and all?

256
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,117
No?

257
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:46,029
Alright, cook whatever you want to.

258
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,591
When would Rumi get up?

259
00:18:47,591 --> 00:18:49,208
We'd better rouse him.

260
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,102
At least he should have breakfast.

261
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,169
Rumi!

262
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:32,291
What's up?

263
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,634
Looking at you.

264
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,835
Now you'd look at me in photographs?

265
00:19:37,835 --> 00:19:40,447
You're never angry in photographs,

266
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,666
Nor vexed,

267
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,745
Nor talking roughly.

268
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:49,461
You're always smiling.

269
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,750
Honestly,

270
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,986
Why are you so insecure?

271
00:19:56,986 --> 00:19:59,220
What's this you're saying?

272
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,211
Why do you think that if someone grabbed my hand, he'd take me along?

273
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,594
No way, God forgive!

274
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,353
How could I think of that?

275
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:09,914
Then why are you so piqued?

276
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:12,265
If you think I made a mistake last night,

277
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,274
Alright, I'd say sorry.

278
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:17,404
You should forget about it too.

279
00:20:17,404 --> 00:20:19,993
It's okay.

280
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,433
Going to the office?

281
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:24,027
Yes.

282
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,375
Come back early.

283
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,314
Why?

284
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,980
Why should I come early?

285
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,872
We have to leave at 8.

286
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:31,904
Do you know how long it takes to get ready?

287
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:33,059
Where are we going?

288
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,167
To the wedding, of course!

289
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,152
Ah, right...

290
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,735
I'd forgotten it entirely.

291
00:20:39,735 --> 00:20:41,140
You're splendid.

292
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,222
Alright, tell me,

293
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:45,484
Should I wear the black sari tonight?

294
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,856
No.

295
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,723
Don't wear a sari with a half blouse.

296
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:50,629
It doesn't look nice.

297
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:53,528
Wait, Danish.

298
00:20:53,528 --> 00:20:56,106
You'd bought that sari for me.

299
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:59,779
But you'd had the blouse made, hadn't you?

300
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,485
It exposes 8 inches of your waist.

301
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:04,877
Look at what you're saying!

302
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:07,531
I'm right in saying so, Mehwish.

303
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:13,123
It doesn't look nice that the men should cover themselves and the women bare half their waists.

304
00:21:13,123 --> 00:21:16,345
It'd embarrass me if people would turn to stare at you.

305
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:17,780
And, on top of that,

306
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,450
He'd be there too.

307
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,637
He'd think you're wearing it for him.

308
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:23,530
What's this nonsense, Danish?

309
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,999
You know t --
-Please.

310
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,898
Don't be angry over it, Mehwish.

311
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:32,186
Women who bare their waists, or roam around wearing sleeveless clothes

312
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:36,113
Are like a bait thrown to ravenous men.

313
00:21:36,113 --> 00:21:38,924
I'm not insecure,

314
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:44,655
But I don't want that my wife should appear before a billionaire like a bait.

315
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:46,638
You're mad.

316
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,482
Raving mad.

317
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:58,316
How are you, Danish?

318
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:03,361
Honestly, mate,

319
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,051
This banger of a bike

320
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:08,916
Doesn't quite suit the sweet Madame.

321
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:11,300
Why are you talking about 'Madame'?

322
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,535
Does she drive it?

323
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:13,958
You don't quite get it.

324
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:14,659
I mean --

325
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,612
She must ride it sometimes.

326
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,936
A bike like this

327
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,993
Doesn't suit her.

328
00:22:21,993 --> 00:22:27,107
A car like yours doesn't suit her either.

329
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:28,754
Even if I had the money,

330
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:30,583
I'd not buy your car.

331
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:34,721
You may sell it to someone else.

332
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,520
Goodbye.

333
00:22:55,413 --> 00:22:57,867
Yes.

334
00:22:57,867 --> 00:23:00,256
He's been 'round the twist since last night.

335
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:01,616
He went to get something to eat,

336
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:04,087
But came back without getting anything.

337
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:06,242
He was panting when he came.

338
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:09,306
And in the morning, he didn't even remember that he'd gone to get something to eat last night.

339
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,554
What happened to him?

340
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:11,250
It's just

341
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,840
That your Monsieur Shehwar

342
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,758
Has gotten into his heart like a dagger.

343
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:17,118
You're laughing?

344
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:19,569
He's gotten on my wick here!

345
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:20,383
Know what,

346
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:22,982
He's stopped me from wearing the black sari.

347
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:23,679
Why?

348
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,133
He says, 'If you wore a sari with a half blouse, people would see your bare waist'.

349
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,789
Hey!

350
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:31,403
What do I do now?

351
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:33,788
One can't even get a full blouse stitched so quickly.

352
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:36,132
Do you remember when I'd first met him?

353
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:38,273
I'd told you back then,

354
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:40,462
'Your husband is very conservative, mate'.

355
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,899
But he doesn't agree that he's conservative.

356
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,107
Or perhaps he just loves me so much...

357
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:47,563
So, he's a tad possessive.

358
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:49,039
That's it with these men.

359
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,742
They become 'possessive' to enslave girls.

360
00:23:52,742 --> 00:23:54,476
Alright, whatever.

361
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,440
Do you know how much your thing upset M. Shehwar?

362
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,114
Why?

363
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:00,097
He was cursing himself.

364
00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:01,085
He said,

365
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:03,628
'All of this happened because of me'.

366
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,072
He said to me,

367
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:08,504
'I just wanted to dance with a beautiful lady',

368
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:10,133
'Nothing more than that'.

369
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,126
'But'

370
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,149
'Apparently, it offended her husband'.

371
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,471
What did you say?

372
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:15,842
What could I say?

373
00:24:15,842 --> 00:24:18,117
Just comforted him with lies.

374
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:21,659
'It's nothing like that'.

375
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,338
Will he be there at the wedding?

376
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,174
Of course, mate.

377
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,127
Mind if I request something, then?

378
00:24:28,127 --> 00:24:29,227
Not at all.

379
00:24:29,227 --> 00:24:31,324
Ask him to stay at an arm's length from me.

380
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:32,975
Why are you saying that?

381
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:34,689
Do you know what he'd think?

382
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,938
You don't know what he'd think!

383
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:40,455
In fact, in his madness, he may even ruffle his feathers!

384
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,446
Hey!

385
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:42,844
Alright, I'll disconnect.

386
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:45,970
I'll ask the tailor if I could get a new blouse before the evening.

387
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,909
Bye.

388
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:50,474
Okay, bye.

389
00:24:55,283 --> 00:24:56,486
May I come in, sir?

390
00:24:56,486 --> 00:24:58,970
Please, come in.

391
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,678
May take a seat, sir?

392
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,070
Please.

393
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,310
Monsieur, it's better if you don't ask about such trifles.

394
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,092
Thank you, sir.

395
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,632
Pray tell.

396
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:18,987
S -- Sir, I wanted to talk to you about something personal.

397
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:20,299
Please, go on.

398
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:22,422
What is it?

399
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:25,464
I'd want to...

400
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:27,518
Buy a car.

401
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:29,969
One of those -- luxury cars.

402
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:33,252
I mean, it's just something I'd wished for for long...

403
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:36,214
And I'd promised my wife when I got married

404
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,214
That I would

405
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:41,214
Get her a luxury car one day.

406
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:44,523
Is it not possible, sir?

407
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:45,415
Monsieur,

408
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:47,253
What isn't possible

409
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,768
In what you've ventured into now?

410
00:25:49,768 --> 00:25:51,688
Just tell Madame

411
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:55,401
To wait two months.

412
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:57,131
Two months?

413
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:58,776
Alright, make that one month.

414
00:25:58,776 --> 00:26:02,374
But you won't get a luxury car in one month.

415
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:03,376
Anyhow,

416
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:07,881
You shouldn't be owning a luxury car before you're promoted.

417
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,817
Why, sir?

418
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,626
Someone may file a complaint,

419
00:26:10,626 --> 00:26:13,360
And it may start an inquiry.

420
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,676
One's always got

421
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:17,736
So many enemies right under one's nose!

422
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,659
Th -- That's right, sir.

423
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,329
If you buy a small car for now,

424
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:25,184
Madame would begin to trust you.

425
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,439
She'd get confident that her husband's got the touch.

426
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:31,744
He'd buy a luxury car one day, too.

427
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:32,867
Of course, sir.

428
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:37,922
But never fear.

429
00:26:37,922 --> 00:26:39,087
Why would I fear?

430
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,358
There's also raids in this trade.

431
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:44,338
Sometimes, you slip by,

432
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:48,055
And sometimes, you get caught.

433
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:50,259
But as I told you, you need not fear.

434
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,276
You just

435
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,869
Have to be a bit practical.

436
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,383
Pra -- ctical -- how?

437
00:26:55,383 --> 00:26:59,524
Put aside 20% of whatever you earn.

438
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:03,073
Think as if you never earned it in the first place.

439
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:04,274
Why, sir?

440
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,983
To get acquitted honourably.

441
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:07,946
Before I came to the office,

442
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:10,505
I'd been to the court for my hearing.

443
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:11,532
Ah, right, sir...

444
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:14,074
What happened to your case?

445
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,851
I've been acquitted honourably.

446
00:27:16,851 --> 00:27:19,618
Congratulations, sir!

447
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:22,246
Thank you.

448
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,560
This TV...

449
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:45,812
Hello?

450
00:27:45,812 --> 00:27:49,049
I'm not wearing the black sari.

451
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:50,579
Alright.

452
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,766
Aren't you happy?

453
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,882
I am.

454
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,266
Should I wear the suit I wore to Meryem's wedding?

455
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,752
An old one?

456
00:27:58,752 --> 00:28:00,422
It isn't too old.

457
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:02,593
More importantly, Anoushay's never seen it.

458
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,187
I'll tell her it's a new one.

459
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:05,553
No.

460
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:06,688
No, as in?

461
00:28:06,688 --> 00:28:08,781
Why would you wear an old suit?

462
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:12,189
Go to the market and buy a new one.

463
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:14,204
I don't have so much money.

464
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:17,268
I'd deposited some money when I opened an account yesterday.

465
00:28:17,268 --> 00:28:18,451
They can't be withdrawn.

466
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:20,263
The money's no problem.

467
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,390
The inner pocket

468
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,330
Of my blue coat has the key to my cupboard.

469
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,079
There's some 3,500 in it.

470
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,266
Take all of it.

471
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:34,636
And forgive me if my words have ever hurt you.

472
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,859
Forgive me, too.

473
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,001
Silly lass!

474
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:36,383
Yes, did you find it?

475
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:39,130
Talk about what I've found besides the money.

476
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,959
What?

477
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,398
My necklace.

478
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,553
Why did you take it out of my cupboard and keep it in yours?

479
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:46,787
Where'd you get the key?

480
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,054
This isn't the necklace you'd bought.

481
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,334
Then?

482
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:54,521
It's the necklace I'd bought.

483
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,012
When did you buy it?

484
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,829
And why didn't you tell me?

485
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:01,481
How could I tell you?

486
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:03,684
I thought I'd surprise you.

487
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,083
I'd even come home early.

488
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,142
But you were away all day.

489
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,283
And when you did come back,

490
00:30:11,283 --> 00:30:14,624
You shoved your surprise in my face.

491
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:17,106
Oh God...

492
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,767
I'm so sorry, Danish.

493
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:20,911
It's okay.

494
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:23,538
Tell me, you have the money, don't you?

495
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:24,709
Yes.

496
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:26,337
Go to the market, now.

497
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:29,289
I'll be back by 5.

498
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:30,163
Okay, bye.

499
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:30,898
Okay,

500
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:31,537
Bye.

501
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:35,436
Listen.

502
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:38,908
I love you.

503
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:44,654
C'mon!

504
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:46,782
Greetings, Madame!

505
00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:48,074
Greetings. How are you?

506
00:30:48,074 --> 00:30:49,043
Never been better!

507
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:50,340
Are you going somewhere?

508
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,684
Yes, to the market.

509
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,094
I don't think I saw a rickshaw in the parking.

510
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:56,227
I'll hire one outside.

511
00:30:56,227 --> 00:30:57,700
Very bad.

512
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,921
Madame would hire a rickshaw when her brother-in-law has a car?

513
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:02,230
You're embarrassing me.

514
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,090
No, it's nothing like that.

515
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,026
If it's not, get in my car,

516
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:07,793
And command me, 'Monty',

517
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:10,106
'Drop me at the market'.

518
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:13,015
Oh -- No, it --
-No excuses, please.

519
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:16,355
Your brother-in-law insists.

520
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:22,185
Alright,

521
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,387
C'mon, my brother.

522
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:24,688
Now you're suckin' diesel.

523
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,952
C'mon, Rumi!

524
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,983
Come.

525
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:43,547
Don't you have a younger sister?

526
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:44,637
I do.

527
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:47,574
She must be just like you.

528
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,890
Not at all.

529
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,907
She's far prettier than I am.

530
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:52,574
I can't believe that.

531
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,238
She may be just like you,

532
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:57,322
But not prettier than you.

533
00:31:57,322 --> 00:31:59,907
But why are you asking about my sister?

534
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:01,255
Mum

535
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:04,373
Thinks I should get married.

536
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:05,950
I've said it plainly

537
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,421
That I would only if I found someone like you.

538
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:09,277
Hey!

539
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,481
I know

540
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,137
Yours and Danish's was a 'love marriage', wasn't it?

541
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:15,261
He didn't tell me.

542
00:32:15,261 --> 00:32:18,247
I just guessed.

543
00:32:18,247 --> 00:32:19,467
How?

544
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:23,949
You may feel bad about it if I told you.

545
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,044
No way.

546
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:26,532
I wouldn't.

547
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:27,977
Please, go on.

548
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,449
The thing is,

549
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,502
I can tell from my experience.

550
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:33,105
A beautiful girl

551
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:33,980
Errs

552
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,458
Either in the name of 'love marriage',

553
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,154
Or is forced by circumstances.

554
00:32:39,154 --> 00:32:40,673
What do you mean?

555
00:32:40,673 --> 00:32:43,124
I think -- It's a bit of a mismatch --

556
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:44,246
I mean,

557
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:45,302
Look at yourself,

558
00:32:45,302 --> 00:32:48,903
And look at Danish.

559
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,912
Did it hurt you?

560
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:01,905
Yes.

561
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:04,036
I'm sorry.

562
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:06,850
No, it's okay...

563
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,537
You didn't even tell where you'd like to go.

564
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:10,291
Right --

565
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,272
I thought I'd told you...

566
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:15,349
I'd like to go to the Forum.

567
00:33:15,349 --> 00:33:18,069
By the way, you're just bothering yourself for no reason...

568
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:20,723
It's nothing, really.

569
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:25,949
Honestly, it bothers me when you ride a rickshaw.

570
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:27,459
The thing is,

571
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,881
A rickshaw isn't your type of ride.

572
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:34,882
You should ride a Mercedes.

573
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:36,458
I'm selling this car, too.

574
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,209
I'm thinking I'd buy a Mercedes.

575
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,684
What do you do?

576
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:43,355
Whoever asks about work these days?

577
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,943
They ask, 'How much do you earn'?

578
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:46,820
Alright,

579
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,996
I'll ask that.

580
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:49,333
How much do you earn?

581
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,354
Just around

582
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:52,208
8 to 9 hundred thousand.

583
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,146
8 to 9 hundred thousand a month?

584
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:56,131
Yes.

585
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:58,131
Wow...

586
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,260
I'd even told Danish

587
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,526
To buy this car from me.

588
00:34:03,526 --> 00:34:05,294
It's only been owned once.

589
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,073
Then?

590
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:08,239
He said, 'I don't have the money'.

591
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,049
I'd even said, 'If you don't have it right now, you can pay me in parts',

592
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:13,886
And then?

593
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,198
He said, 'No'.

594
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:17,658
'I can't afford a car'.

595
00:34:17,658 --> 00:34:18,925
Please don't mind it,

596
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:22,916
But we're friends and he even talks about such personal matters.

597
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,416
What other personal matters

598
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,295
Does he talk about?

599
00:34:26,295 --> 00:34:27,073
Just --

600
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:28,486
The usual...

601
00:34:28,486 --> 00:34:30,265
About Rumi,

602
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:32,060
And you,

603
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,446
Or if the two of you ever have a row...

604
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:39,183
Although -- He generally conceals the thing about the rows.

605
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:41,637
Surely, I'm not saying too much?

606
00:34:41,637 --> 00:34:42,291
No.

607
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,338
Not at all.

608
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:48,517
Promise me, then, that you won't tell Danish.

609
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:51,652
I won't tell.

610
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:59,968
Is it him?

611
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:05,422
Don't tell him that you're in the car with me.

612
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:06,359
Hello?

613
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,032
Hired a rickshaw?

614
00:35:08,032 --> 00:35:09,390
No.

615
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,766
I'm in the car.

616
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:12,521
Anoushay's there?

617
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:13,689
Not Anoushay.

618
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,928
Monty.

619
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:17,619
He was insisting,

620
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,414
'I'm your brother-in-law; I'd drop you off'.

621
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:26,006
Who told you that sly devil's my f -- friend?

622
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,578
The blighter's an ace rogue!

623
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,377
And you got in the car with him without even thinking?

624
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:32,750
Get off the car! Get off!

625
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,440
I'll have him drop me at the Forum.

626
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,195
We'll talk about it when you're home.

627
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:37,974
Listen to what I'm saying, Mehwish.

628
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:41,538
Ask the bugger to stop the car!

629
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,630
Hello?

630
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:55,529
Tell the boss it's an emergency; I have to go.
-Alright.

631
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,476
How are you, Danish, mate?

632
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:13,104
How are you, eh, bugger?

633
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,833
How are you?
-Danish!

634
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:17,068
Danish! What's the matter?
-How are you, eh?

635
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:20,178
How dare you take my wife along for a ride?
-Da -- Danish! Mate --

636
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,284
As if I shoved her in! She came to me!

637
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:24,671
Danish, wait. I'll tell you!

638
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,823
Stay back! I'll tell you --

639
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,011
You can't control your bonny wife!

640
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:37,196
I didn't force her! Ask her when she gets back why she got in with me!

641
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:40,876
And I didn't take her along with any bad intentions! I see her as my sister-in-law!

642
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:42,845
Stop, Danish!

643
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,428
The poor man's right.

644
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:47,813
Maybe it's true that your wife asked him to drop her.

645
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:50,430
One doesn't take someone along by force like that.

646
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,381
There's nothing to worry about.

647
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:54,312
She willingly got in with him.

648
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,186
It happens among neighbours, M. Danish,

649
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:58,693
One sometimes thumbs a lift; one sometimes gives a lift...

650
00:36:58,693 --> 00:37:02,368
It's just the usual.

651
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
