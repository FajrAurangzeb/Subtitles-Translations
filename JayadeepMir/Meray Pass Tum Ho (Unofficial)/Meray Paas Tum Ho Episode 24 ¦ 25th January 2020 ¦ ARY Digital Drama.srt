1
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,886
Good evening.

2
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,186
Good evening.

3
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:00,136
I'm Ifrah.

4
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:01,526
Monty's wife.

5
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:03,546
Oh.

6
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,026
May you be happy.

7
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,486
Likewise.

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,600
Come.

9
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,960
Why are you washing your face again and again?

10
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,740
I haven't seen you like this before.

11
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,243
It's because he's gone to meet Mehwish, innit?

12
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,167
What are you looking at there?

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,820
I've begun to fear this door.

14
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>He</i>'d walked in through it.</i>

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,826
You'd walked out through it.

16
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,136
Please, Danish...

17
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,740
Have your tea, will you?

18
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,356
Thank you.

19
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,176
So you still put out your cigarette when you see me?

20
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,537
It felt as if you're scared of me even today.

21
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,586
Rumi said you looked dashing.

22
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,206
I don't like to look dashing.

23
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,375
Do you know the date?

24
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,800
17th November?

25
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,440
What'd happened today?

26
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,080
What?

27
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,915
We'd met for the first time today.

28
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,486
Oh, right...

29
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,326
Don't you remember?

30
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,236
No. I chose to forget it.

31
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,023
I just remember the day you left.

32
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,426
I can't seem to forget it.

33
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,920
<i>Of vexed hearts,</i>

34
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,750
<i>The path is straight</i>

35
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,910
<i>Never is it</i>

36
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,021
<i>That they look back.</i>

37
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,800
<i>Of vexed hearts,</i>

38
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,176
<i>The path is straight</i>

39
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:34,310
<i>Never is it</i>

40
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,338
<i>That they look back.</i>

41
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,539
<i>The strands of love,</i>

42
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,770
<i>The bond of loyalty</i>

43
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:57,056
<i>Once broken, can never be mended</i>

44
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,270
You're leaving?

45
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,636
No...

46
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,756
I was opening the door.

47
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,740
My heart grows restless...

48
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,510
Know what, everyone thought that if I met you,

49
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,920
I won't be able to leave you.

50
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,350
I never felt so.

51
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,746
But I feel so today...

52
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,101
This wind...

53
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,956
This cool breeze...

54
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,425
I want to live...

55
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,976
I was right there the other day, wasn't I, Mehwish?

56
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,351
Well, you didn't even look back at me.

57
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,680
I was right there, mate...

58
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,460
And I'd stopped

59
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,690
The man who thought himself to be a great businessman, saying,

60
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,600
'You're offering me 50 million for this worthless, unworthy woman'?

61
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,960
Know what, Mehwish,

62
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,940
Many people had said to me,

63
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,390
'Wives often forgive'

64
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,500
'When their husbands commit such sins.'

65
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,256
'Why don't you forgive her, too?'

66
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,456
I always said,

67
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:18,668
'I've already forgiven her'.

68
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,220
'If only she forgave me'...

69
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,007
'And spared my life'!

70
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,696
But you didn't spare my life.

71
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,040
Do you know, I believe

72
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,430
That once you've two-timed,

73
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,176
Just move on, mate.

74
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,540
If you've been two-timed yourself,

75
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,096
Don't look back at your old, loyal partner.

76
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,997
What could he do now?

77
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,890
But know what, I couldn't figure out to this day

78
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,270
Which of murder

79
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,096
And infidelity is the greater crime.

80
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,810
A murder just...

81
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,246
Takes a life.

82
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:53,550
But infidelity is a brutal murder

83
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,796
That spares the life.

84
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,236
No...

85
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,902
Please, Mehwish -- Please --

86
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,903
Don't come close to me. Don't touch me.

87
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,156
Please...

88
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,920
I realise today

89
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
That to touch

90
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,560
Is a gifted right.

91
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,796
One gets it only when one deserves it.

92
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,920
Just think about it -

93
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,966
Do <i>you</i> deserve it?</i>

94
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,629
You don't, do you?

95
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,706
Listen, Mehwish --

96
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,967
Please don't visit my grave if I die.

97
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,296
Alright, don't come too close.

98
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,490
I'm keeping my distance

99
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,020
From the disloyal.

100
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,926
I'll do to you what you did to love.

101
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,767
You'll lose me, never to find me again.

102
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,244
Forget finding me...

103
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,440
I wouldn't even pay you a visit in your dreams.

104
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,130
It's been two hours since I'd come, innit?

105
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,451
Rumi was supposed to come --

106
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,712
Rumi was supposed to come -- After two hours, Mehwish...

107
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,872
Please -- If he comes --

108
00:12:40,872 --> 00:12:44,047
Comfort him -- Take care of him...

109
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,010
He's gone through a lot more than me.

110
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,476
Please -- Don't touch me...

111
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,550
Please, Mehwish -- Don't touch me --

112
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,146
Please -- Don't touch --

113
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,630
Ifrah!

114
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,839
Monty!

115
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,266
<i>How would I</i>

116
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:29,080
<i>Heal the beats of this heart,</i>

117
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,076
<i>For like it,</i>

118
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:38,987
<i>I, too, am broken...</i>

119
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,089
<i>How would I</i>

120
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:50,060
<i>Heal the beats of this heart,</i>

121
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,670
<i>For like it,</i>

122
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,420
<i>I, too, am broken...</i>

123
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,626
He's had a severe cardiac arrest.

124
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,366
Give him entropy.

125
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:32,456
And start dopamine infusion at 10 ml.

126
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:34,656
And keep the AED ready, okay?

127
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:35,946
Okay, sir.

128
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,906
R --

129
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,856
Rumi...

130
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,886
My mistake, Maman.

131
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:10,620
Papa thought that if he met you,

132
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,956
He wouldn't be able to come back.

133
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,006
Rumi...

134
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,216
Who's Rumi?

135
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:02,647
Me.

136
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,416
Come. He's calling you.

137
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,086
Not you.

138
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,109
Just Rumi.

139
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:13,346
The patient has asked me to call just Rumi.

140
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,417
Please wait here.

141
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,736
Rumi...

142
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,516
Yes, Papa?

143
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,027
Are you crying?

144
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:22,946
No.

145
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,840
Remember...

146
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,197
Your Papa is your strength...

147
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,226
Yes, I remember.

148
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,563
I --

149
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:47,180
I've had a heart attack...

150
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,926
I know...

151
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,116
Don't laugh, Papa.

152
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:59,712
I will laugh, Rumi.

153
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,010
Your Maman's made me laugh...

154
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,401
His SPO2's dropping...

155
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,690
Please don't take it off. You need oxygen.

156
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,961
Please, doctor...

157
00:20:14,961 --> 00:20:16,921
I'm fine.

158
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,616
Alert everyone.

159
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,616
Monitor SPO2 and heart rate.

160
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,789
When I met your Maman today...

161
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,110
I saw --

162
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,480
She's not the same anymore --

163
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,190
Know what, she was trying to make it up to me...

164
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,891
Saying sorry...

165
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,610
Remember...

166
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,606
How I always used to make it up to her?

167
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,291
Saying sorry without reason?

168
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,196
Know what --

169
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,536
Sh --

170
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,380
She --

171
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,076
She's my weakness.

172
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,640
I never thought in 8 years --

173
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,720
That --

174
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,306
I'd ever have to live without her...

175
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,050
And --

176
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,049
I couldn't -- Could I?

177
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,306
That's why I'm laughing...

178
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,970
She used to scold me --

179
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:59,436
Put me to sleep --

180
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,946
Like she used to scold you to sleep --

181
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:09,047
Back then -- It felt --

182
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,996
She's not just your Mum --

183
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,526
A bit --

184
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:22,867
Mine too --

185
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,300
And when your Mum leaves you --

186
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,370
How would the kid live?

187
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,229
You're not crying, are you?

188
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,976
No, Papa...

189
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,477
G --

190
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,499
Good...

191
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,776
She --

192
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:57,536
She's back now --

193
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,840
She'd left us --

194
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,186
To do something --

195
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,150
It's done and over now --

196
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,246
She knows now --

197
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,920
By leaving Paradise in your search for Paradise --

198
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,430
You can never find it...

199
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,200
We'll talk over breakfast.

200
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,359
Get some rest, Papa.

201
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,560
No, Rumi --

202
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,936
Keep me awake...

203
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,227
Don't ask me to sleep --

204
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,976
I'll sleep --

205
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:44,596
Alright, sorry, Papa. Stay awake.

206
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:46,536
Eyes open.

207
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,850
Want to know a secret?

208
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,636
Yes, Papa?

209
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,466
I didn't usually remember my Dad...

210
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,224
Know why?

211
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:08,980
Why, Papa?

212
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,043
He'd pay me a visit in my dreams every day.

213
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,470
Wake me and have me sit for a chat --

214
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,110
He'd ask --

215
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,500
'What'd you do today?'

216
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,356
'You go to the office on time, don't you?'

217
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:28,107
'You don't take bribes, do you?'

218
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,999
'What about Rumi's admission?'

219
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,890
After your admission -- He'd ask --

220
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,606
'He's studying hard, isn't he?'

221
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,898
'Do you check his homework?'

222
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,003
He'd say --

223
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,310
Tell Rumi

224
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,306
To become a great man --

225
00:24:59,306 --> 00:25:03,036
I will become a great man, Papa.

226
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,956
But remember --

227
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,220
He'd say --

228
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,230
'A great man'

229
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,760
'Has his earnings in his pocket,'

230
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,296
'Not his price.'

231
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,299
Look --

232
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:44,180
That line --

233
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,216
That line --
-Prepare the AED.

234
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,980
Quickly!

235
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes, Papa.

236
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,131
Okay, sir.

237
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,180
It's --

238
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,130
The line of the heart.

239
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,053
Level --

240
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:53,594
Now --

241
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,176
Straight.
-Check his heart rate. Vitals?

242
00:25:56,176 --> 00:25:57,730
We're losing him, sir.

243
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,460
The heart's stopped --

244
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,926
But --

245
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,437
But -- I'm alive --

246
00:26:07,437 --> 00:26:09,830
My son --

247
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,826
In your heart --

248
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:14,977
Your --

249
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:18,309
I live in your heart...

250
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,696
Say 'Yes', will you...

251
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:27,236
Y -- Yes, Papa...

252
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:29,426
R -- Rumi!

253
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,256
We'll meet in your dreams...

254
00:26:34,256 --> 00:26:37,688
I'll be th -- there -- everyday...

255
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,381
Check vitals.

256
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,678
Check vitals.
-Rumi...

257
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,581
Papa...

258
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,242
Take the kid outside.

259
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:49,730
Clear the bed.

260
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,822
Clear the bed.
-Rumi...

261
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:51,740
Rumi...

262
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,990
We'll meet in your dreams...

263
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,760
Delivering the shock...

264
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,377
Rumi...

265
00:26:56,377 --> 00:26:57,650
Rumi...
-3...

266
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,020
We'll meet in your dreams...
-2...

267
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,626
We'll meet in your dreams...
-1...

268
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,980
3... 2... 1...

269
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,236
Rumi...

270
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,038
We'll meet in your dreams...

271
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,070
Papa's alright, isn't he?

272
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,057
Sorry, Ma'am...

273
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:33,526
He's no more.

274
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,006
Papa says he'll pay a visit in dreams.

275
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,550
He promised...

276
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>How would I</i>

277
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,436
<i>Heal the beats of this heart,</i>

278
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:06,417
<i>For like it,</i>

279
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:12,201
<i>I, too, am broken...</i>

280
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:18,407
<i>How would I</i>

281
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:23,420
<i>Heal the beats of this heart,</i>

282
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,981
<i>For like it,</i>

283
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:32,982
<i>I, too, am broken...</i>

284
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:41,011
<i>Granted, that I am</i>

285
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:48,461
<i>A bit angry with you,</i>

286
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>It is also with this life</i>

287
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:58,932
<i>That I am cross.</i>

288
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,546
<i>I have learnt</i>

289
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:12,436
<i>From the sin of disloyalty</i>

290
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:16,990
<i>That to part</i>

291
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:24,006
<i>Is to die...</i>

292
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,639
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

293
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:46,380
<i>Of forgetting as you leave;</i>

294
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:53,860
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

295
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:59,861
<i>From my life, now that you're leaving.</i>

296
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:07,016
<i>As nothing more than a formality, if nothing else,</i>

297
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:14,980
<i>Turn back and glance at me for a moment;</i>

298
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,726
<i>Fulfil the vows of our bond for once</i>

299
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:26,026
<i>As you break it.</i>

300
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,190
English translation: J. Mir

301
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,879

00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:49,360
