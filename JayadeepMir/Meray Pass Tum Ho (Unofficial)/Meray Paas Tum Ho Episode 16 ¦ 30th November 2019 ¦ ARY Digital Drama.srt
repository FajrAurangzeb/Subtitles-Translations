1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,591
So, I say --

2
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:11,610
What is going on?

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,130
What is going on?

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,280
What the devil are you doing in my room?

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,286
How dare --

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,710
Keep sitting.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,930
Sit down!

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,880
If anyone so much as moved a muscle,

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,679
If anyone so much as moved a muscle, he'd die by my hand!

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,333
Right, Shehwar Ahmed,

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,230
Chairman of Shehwar Chemicals,

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,091
We were to talk about something.

13
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,000
You don't know who you're messing with.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,720
I'll make an example of you for every pleb like you to watch.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,210
That's my line.

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,880
I'll say it today.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,290
What are you looking at?

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,479
Call the police!

19
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,930
That's the bleedin' limit -- What are you doing!?

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,548
The police come in <i>after</i> the incident.</i>

21
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:19,180
Let me create the incident.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,880
But first, tell me,

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,830
Tell me!

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,430
Say whatever you want to!

25
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,550
Tell them all

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,650
What you'd said over the phone!

27
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,040
Spill the beans!

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,740
Easy there, M. Danish, let go of my collar.

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,680
Easy there, M. Danish, let go of my collar.
-Tell them all!

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,090
Why don't you say anything?

31
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,080
What'd your lawyers do to me if they didn't meet within two days, eh?

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,260
They'd have my hide?

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,200
Look.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,150
I'm wearing a suit.

35
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,704
I figured I'd wear something nice before they have my hide.

36
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,193
Don't disturb me!

37
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,310
I'm in a meeting!

38
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,060
Come here.

39
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,040
What are you doing?

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,621
Danish -- Wh -- What is this?
-Here! Sit down!

41
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:02,060
Just pause and think for two minutes.

42
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,920
If you want to have my hide, you'd need your lawyers,

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,470
If you want to have my hide, you'd need your lawyers, or your hoodlums.

44
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,180
You'd call them. It'd take time.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,354
But I need only two minutes to expose you.

46
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:14,660
Look,

47
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,860
My ex-wife, who's with you today,

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,500
She's been sold.

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,720
You've bought her.

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,560
I said, 'Fine',

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,320
'What's sold belongs to the buyer'.

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,640
But now, you're talking about <i>my</i> son,</i>

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,320
And my son is all that remains of my pride.

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,700
You said that your lawyers would blow me to bits.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,660
You made a mistake there.

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,020
You reminded me that I am my son's strength, not his weakness.

57
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,000
So, remember, Shehwar Ahmed,

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,390
If you dared threaten me again,

59
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,070
Or tried to strike a deal with me about my son,

60
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,520
I'd drag you by this tie of yours,

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,800
And expose you before everyone for real.

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,850
This incident would benefit all of you, too.

63
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,260
He can't fire you now.

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,840
If he dares to shout at you,

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,590
Go and tell everyone

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,980
About what happened here today.

67
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,200
Understood?

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,690
Have a nice day,

69
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,952
Shehwar Ahmed.

70
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,023
Leave me alone.

71
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,910
And here...

72
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,450
Here he falls.

73
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,440
Didn't fall.

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,290
He didn't fall! He's walking alright, mate!

75
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,480
And there...

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,780
Papa, ice cream.

77
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,295
C'mon.

78
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,300
Here.

79
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,756
That's it.

80
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,229
Run, quick.

81
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,810
Here.

82
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,160
Honestly?

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm proud of you.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,820
You're the bravest Papa in the world.

85
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,350
Innit?

86
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,120
You kicked and flipped his chair.

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,500
Yeah.

88
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,820
He fell face-first on the floor. His legs were trembling.

89
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,627
Just keep on laughing like that.

90
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,380
I'll take care of everyone.

91
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,760
Take care of everyone, I'll keep on laughing like this.

92
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,960
You're proper clever, aren't you?

93
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,320
You even said 'Will you marry me' to the teacher, didn't you?

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,180
You rapscallion.

95
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,770
Should I get things started with her?

96
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,550
And if she agreed?

97
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,325
Rumi!

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,580
You're a proper rapscallion, aren't you!

99
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,290
Get things started with her, will you?

100
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,070
She's very sweet.

101
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,060
Or should I get things started?

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,400
What'd you say to her?

103
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,507
I'd say, 'Marry my Papa. My father is the best father'.

104
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,095
Alright, get off now.

105
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,230
What is it?

106
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm looking at you.

107
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,500
You look good.

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,930
Dashing.

109
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,290
Take care.

110
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,150
You too.

111
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,680
Bye.

112
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,530
Take care.
-Just a minute.

113
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:43,840
To be honest, if I were just a tad older, I would've married her.

114
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,950
Shut up, Rumi.

115
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,370
You're cross?

116
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,340
Yes.

117
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,928
Alright, sorry.

118
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,750
Okay.

119
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,901
Bye.

120
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,870
What happened?

121
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,010
Nothing.

122
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,240
Something's happened. One doesn't get injured just like that.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,410
Tell me, Shehwar!

124
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,550
It seems you've fallen face-first!
-C'mon, mate.

125
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,730
Please, tell me, Shehwar, the worry kills me!
-First, decide who else you worry for so much that it kills you!

126
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,296
Shehwar!

127
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,640
By the Lord, what happened?

128
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,020
I've fallen face-first while striking a deal between you and your son.

129
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,590
Had a row?

130
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,970
A row?

131
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,220
Who'd dare have a row with me?

132
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,610
The bugger attacked me suddenly.

133
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,310
I wasn't expecting this.

134
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,520
Well, it isn't anything serious.

135
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,170
Just a few drops of blood.

136
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,538
Get me some water.

137
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,069
What about Rumi?

138
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:08,320
Honestly? I feel pity for myself.

139
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,150
The woman who was dying for me until yesterday

140
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,630
Is in pain to remember her son today.

141
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,680
May I know where I stand?

142
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,640
He won't meet you.

143
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,480
I talked to the lawyer.

144
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,380
The two of you can't meet as long as Rumi doesn't want to.

145
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,370
And please,

146
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,500
Control your motherly affection.

147
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,420
I can't meet that pleb again and again because of you.

148
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,640
I mean,

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,560
If he grabbed me by the collar,

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,230
What'd be left of my dignity?

151
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,010
So, that's the reply he's given after two days.

152
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,270
He scared you and left.

154
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,410
He beat the chairman of Shehwar Chemicals

155
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,750
And left.

156
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,440
What should I do?

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,250
Go over to him with the police?

158
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,970
The chairman of Shehwar Chemicals has come to fight a pleb.

159
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,980
I could have him disappear

160
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,030
Without a trace.

161
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,690
But I've held back because of you.

162
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,220
When did I ask you to hold back?

163
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,740
If anything happened to the bugger,

164
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,746
You'd be the prime suspect.

165
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:20,940
The police will say plainly,

166
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,220
'This woman connived with her partner to kill him'.

167
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,600
And

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,310
The media!

169
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,530
If the media got wind of such a news,

170
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,340
They will spread it so much that even Trump would hear about it!

171
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,430
Your son is in his trap.

172
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,050
He teaches him not to meet his Maman.

173
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,040
He'd be a bit angry, too.

174
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,941
He'd say, too, 'I won't meet her'.

175
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,460
What are you looking at?

176
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,550
Try to understand.

177
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,330
Sometimes, it happens this way.

178
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,710
You'd said that it's your threat,

179
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,840
And your threat means something.

180
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,620
You'd have the bugger murdered by my hand.

181
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,900
Okay, I'll do something.

182
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,050
He'd bring his son to you.

183
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,370
I can't even meet someone in this condition.

184
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,740
What'd I say?

185
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,470
'My lover's ex-husband has beaten me'?

186
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,366
Sounds so cheap!

187
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,350
Why are you sitting here all alone? Why aren't you playing?

188
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,758
I'm resting...

189
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,295
When are you meeting your Mum?

190
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,920
I know...

191
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,150
You don't feel like meeting her now, but you have to sometime.

192
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,660
After all, she's your mother, innit?

193
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,850
She loves you so much.

194
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,590
I've seen it in her eyes.

195
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,660
I love her so much, too.

196
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,440
Didn't you see that?

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,990
My Papa loves her so much. You didn't see that either.

198
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,944
You've seen nothing.

199
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,620
Alright...

200
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,620
Let's talk about something else.

201
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,300
What?

202
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,280
Do you know

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,550
Your Papa called.

204
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,630
He said, 'He's very brave'.

205
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,430
He surprised me yesterday.

206
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,770
How?

207
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,360
The evil uncle, you know - my Maman's husband?

208
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,770
He beat him badly.

209
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,001
He used to threaten Papa a lot.

210
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,470
Don't you feel good?

211
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,540
I feel very good.

212
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,320
I know.

213
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,430
The three of us used to share a home.

214
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,481
Now, there's three different houses...

215
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,470
It's all because of that evil uncle.

216
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,963
It's all because of your Maman.

217
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm sorry...

218
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,930
I didn't mean it.

219
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,886
I know you're right.

220
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:10,820
No --

221
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,510
I'd just --

222
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,310
Anyway, let's talk about something else.

223
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,090
What?

224
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,520
Get your Dad married.

225
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,660
I talked yesterday, and he said 'Shut up'!

226
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,150
He says that once a year, when he's very angry.

227
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,380
However did it occur to <i>you?</i></i>

228
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,650
It just did.

229
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,120
I've found a girl who looks very good with him.

230
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,870
He's seen her face too,

231
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,708
But he didn't agree. Scolded me.

232
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,965
Who is it?

233
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:46,020
Someone I know.

234
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,800
Someone <i>you</i> know?</i>

235
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,756
Yes.

236
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,730
Is she sweet?

237
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,240
Very.

238
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
Why didn't he agree?

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
His heart's broken, teacher.

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,340
He won't get married now.

241
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,936
How say I talk to him?

242
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,220
Why are you laughing?

243
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,930
Nothing really. He'd scold you.

244
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,134
C'mon...

245
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,770
You'll see, he won't scold me.

246
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll talk to him.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,125
Laughing again?

248
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,113
I'm going to play.

249
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,860
Be done with it already.

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,530
A pleb's raised his hand on me because of you.

251
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,340
I took no action against him because of your son.

252
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,490
Now, if you're cross me like that,

253
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,310
Where'd I go?

254
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:44,040
And if you, being Shehwar Ahmed, are so helpless,

255
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,110
Tell me,

256
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,880
Where'd I go?

257
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,160
Helpless, as in?

258
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,450
I thought he'd be scared by your threat,

259
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,540
And out of fear, come running to me with Rumi,

260
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,320
And humbly say, 'Here'.

261
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,780
'Keep him with you'.

262
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,620
But you've come back with a broken nose.

263
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,073
You'd have him killed by my hand.

264
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,890
I want to meet Rumi.

265
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,304
Do whatever you must.

266
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,420
If you dared threaten me again,

267
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,130
Or tried to strike a deal with me about my son,

268
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,570
I'd drag you by this tie of yours,

269
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,315
And expose you for real.

270
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,417
What are you thinking?

271
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,438
I'm thinking of a solution.

272
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,220
Talk to him.

273
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,190
Explain to him

274
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,196
That he's being spared because of you and because of your son,

275
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:53,640
Otherwise, one can get a man killed for 30,000 in Karachi.

276
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,050
Say that you're his mother,

277
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,720
You have a right to meet him.

278
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,020
Tell him to be done with this lowly attitude,

279
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,040
Tell him to be done with this lowly attitude, or he'd be found in a sack somewhere.

280
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,230
What are you saying?

281
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,057
Just request him if you want to meet your son.

282
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:10,190
Even I'd go down on my knees for your sake.

283
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,680
I should go to meet him?

284
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,540
Yes.

285
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,120
Go.

286
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,860
I'd be done with the issues at the office by then.

287
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,610
Just see what I'll do.

288
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,700
What are you looking at?

289
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,460
So what, if it seems a bit cowardly

290
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,630
So what, if it seems a bit cowardly to request like this?

291
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,606
No problem.

292
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,360
Fine by me, for your sake.

293
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,430
I just want to see you happy.

294
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,610
But one thing's for sure, Mehwish,

295
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,601
I won't spare him.

296
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,747
We'd decided on 4,000. Alright?

297
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,170
He's leaving because of his wife.

298
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,920
Naturally.

299
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,040
A man's head sinks in shame.

300
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,460
It becomes difficult

301
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,240
To look those close to oneself in the eye.

302
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,690
But I didn't quite get it, Mr Sheikh.

303
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,880
All of it happened so suddenly.

304
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,720
Got wind one day that his wife's leaving,

305
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,230
And now that Mr Danish's following suit.

306
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,730
Why did she leave him?

307
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,118
She didn't leave him, Monsieur, she's eloped.

308
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:40,650
She had an affair

309
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,560
With her boss.

310
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,680
Oh...

311
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,890
Would you look at that!

312
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,260
Money can be so magnetic!

313
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,860
M. Danish is coming.

314
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,290
By the Lord, M. Danish, I'm very sad that you're leaving.

315
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,900
It feels like someone very dear to me is leaving.

316
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,780
Please forgive me if I've ever done something wrong.

317
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,340
Not at all, sir.

318
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,090
You were so saintly.

319
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,840
Please, forgive us if we've ever done something wrong.
-No. Nothing of the sort...

320
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,900
There's nothing like that.

321
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,096
You didn't mention where you're going.

322
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:21,321
I haven't really thought about it.

323
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:23,560
I'd keep my things at my friend's.

324
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,850
I might even leave the country.

325
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,150
But I'd come to meet you.

326
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,210
Sure, M. Danish.

327
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,450
We'll meet again.

328
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,786
If the Lord wills so.

329
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,850
I started a row with you,

330
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,340
Broke our friendship...

331
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,710
Please forgive me.

332
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,740
No, mate -- Danish --

333
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,630
We had a row because of me.

334
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,040
The fault was mine.

335
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,330
I don't even know what I've uttered just now --

336
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,170
Please forgive me.

337
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,571
If the Lord wills, we'll meet again.

338
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:59,970
Thank you so much for caring.

339
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,066
Take care.

340
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,570
Let me know if you need anything.

341
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,340
Alright?

342
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,300
Goodbye, M. Danish.

343
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,400
Goodbye.

344
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Show them this clause.

345
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,661
Sure.

346
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,440
And discuss it with the lawyers.

347
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,830
I will, and I'll submit my report.

348
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,690
Sir,

349
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,734
Please call the Stock Exchange.

350
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:02,540
What happened?

351
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,350
The share's fallen by 25 Rupees.

352
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,080
25 Rupees?

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,910
As in --

354
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,230
As in -- The market's crashing?

355
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,290
No, sir.

356
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,939
The market's rising by 14 points.

357
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,290
Hello?

358
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,661
I'm going.

359
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,260
Where?

360
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,550
To meet Danish.

361
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,526
Go, then. Why are you calling me?

362
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,510
What's going on?

363
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,170
And what about the strike?

364
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,021
The strike's been going on for two days.

365
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:33,887
So, there's been no work?

366
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:34,700
Obviously, sir.

367
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,010
How would there be any work when no one's working?

368
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,810
Why?

369
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,750
I'd revised their salaries.

370
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,530
I'd said, 'Give them a raise'.

371
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,520
No, sir, you'd strongly refused to give even a penny's worth of raise.

372
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,700
What's gotten into you, man!

373
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,450
I'm saying it now, 'Give them a raise'!

374
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,730
And call before revising the salaries.

375
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,360
Yes, sir.

376
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,950
Leave.

377
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,660
Madame!

378
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,541
Madame!

379
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:36,300
If you're here to meet M. Danish, he's not here.

380
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,350
What do you mean, 'He's not here'?

381
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,010
He's sold the flat and left.

382
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,190
What?

383
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,680
Where'd he go?

384
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,947
He didn't tell anything. Not even to me.

385
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,040
Does nobody know?

386
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,071
Nobody.

387
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,770
Is it over?

388
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,540
What's over?

389
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,410
I'm talking about the strike.

390
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,720
Are you alright?

391
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,630
Who is it?

392
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,590
What?

393
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,810
I'm asking who is it?

394
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,970
It's Mehwish, Shehwar.

395
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,020
Oh!

396
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,660
Why didn't you tell me?

397
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,450
What is it?

398
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,890
Danish has sold the flat and left.

399
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,555
He's left?

400
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,149
The gutless bugger's fled!

401
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,710
The GM called today.

402
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,810
Said, 'They're giving a raise to everyone'.

403
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,470
'Call the strike off'.

404
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,560
I said, 'Oh please',

405
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,670
'Send it in writing'.

406
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,395
Revise the salary

407
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:33,974
Of every single employee,

408
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:37,124
Show me the difference from the old salary,

409
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:41,324
And then, we'd call off the strike if we approve.

410
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,390
The shares have fallen by 2,500 Rupees today.

411
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,510
Monsieur le Chairman, I say, invest everything in your account.

412
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,980
I have, too.

413
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,580
Purchased shares worth 450,000 Rupees.

414
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,960
So have I.

415
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,413
Invested every penny lying in my account,

416
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:59,914
And whatever I got after selling my wife's jewellery.

417
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,000
Monsieur le Chairman, I say, invest everything in your account.

418
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,380
I have, too.

419
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,830
Purchased shares worth 450,000 Rupees.

420
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,130
So have I.

421
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,710
Invested every penny lying in my account,

422
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,176
And whatever I got after selling my wife's jewellery.

423
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,490
Enough with it already.

424
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,196
You've been drinking since 8 p.m.

425
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,030
Do you know,

426
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,055
I've lost in this business for the first time.

427
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:59,734
The wretched unionists won.

428
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,357
Cost me 132 million.

429
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:10,990
And I'd be robbed of it every year.

430
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,960
Once the salaries have been raised,

431
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,510
They don't come down.

432
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,420
You've just raised their salaries.

433
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,528
It's not a loss, Shehwar.

434
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,340
Technically,

435
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,510
It's a loss, sweetheart.

436
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,490
The more the salaries,

437
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,975
The less the profit.

438
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:36,460
Plus, live in constant fear of the buggers' strike.

439
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,070
Always thinking

440
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,490
When the next strike could be.

441
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,290
Alright, relax.

442
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,048
Go to sleep.

443
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,140
How can I sleep?

444
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,170
I'm so worried...

445
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,210
You're so worried...

446
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,206
How could I sleep?

447
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,880
And that bugger, your ex-husband,

448
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,786
Has fled.

449
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,465
You couldn't meet him,

450
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,670
Nor talk to him.

451
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,050
How would you meet your son now?

452
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,115
I can understand...

453
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,421
I know a mother's sorrow...

454
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,211
I know what you must be going through.

455
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,550
You don't need to worry about me.

456
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,970
I've left it to God --
-No.

457
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,120
Don't leave it to God.

458
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,270
He's not happy with women who go for a divorce.

459
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,460
Do whatever you do

460
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,315
Hiding from Him.

461
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,530
You're drunk, Shehwar.

462
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,200
No, I'm not drunk.

463
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm absolutely fine.

464
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
And

465
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,970
I'm planning

466
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,757
To go on a trip.

467
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,920
How say we go to London for a few days,

468
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,400
And forget everything that's happened to us?

469
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,060
Let's get married one of these days.

470
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,193
Then, we can go to London.

471
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,846
What is it?

472
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,580
I think...

473
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,875
I'm drunk...

474
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,230
I --

475
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,700
I should --

476
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,519
Catch some sleep...

477
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,623
Hello?

478
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:15,164
Salman Ibrahim?

479
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:17,180
Yes, who is it?

480
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,959
It's Danish, mate.

481
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,090
Danish Akhtar.

482
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,410
However did you remember me today, boyo?

483
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,480
I needed your help.

484
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,980
But first, how are you? And how's Mehwish?

485
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,310
And I heard you have a son?

486
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,160
How old is he?

487
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,496
6 years.

488
00:28:31,496 --> 00:28:33,260
Must be cute.

489
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,600
Yes.

490
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,460
And what about her?

491
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,770
Your English rose?

492
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,210
We'll meet

493
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,880
And talk.

494
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,420
Tell me,

495
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,270
You work at the stock exchange, right?

496
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,310
Work?

497
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,800
You're underestimating me, boyo.

498
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm a member.

499
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,460
Ayesha and I have bought a membership.

500
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,470
It's still going on with the two of you, eh?

501
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,000
I'd heard you'd gotten married.

502
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,380
Yes, I've gotten married,

503
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,060
But I've got love going on too.

504
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,720
Very bad, mate.

505
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,780
No idea what you folks mean by marriage and love...

506
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,475
Listen to the whole thing, mun, I've married her. Ayesha.

507
00:29:06,475 --> 00:29:07,883
Then, just say that.

508
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:10,230
I do have the licence to love now, don't I?

509
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,920
Openly.

510
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,990
Alright, what is it that you need?

511
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,240
I'll be coming to you tomorrow.

512
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,740
We'll talk then.

513
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,650
Come at 10 a.m.

514
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,725
Okay.

515
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,146
Done.

516
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:22,976
Bye.

517
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:24,125
Bye.

518
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:25,595
And give love to Ayesha.

519
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:29,295
I've given her so much love... I swear by you!

520
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,690
I'd like some tea.

521
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,210
Just one cup.

522
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,727
Thank you.

523
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,730
Teacher!

524
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:11,050
Teacher!

525
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,294
Hi, Rumi.

526
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,060
What is it?

527
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,840
Did you talk to Papa?

528
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,890
About what?

529
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,986
You'd said you'd tell Papa to get married.

530
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:31,365
I will, sure, but first, introduce me to the girl.

531
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:35,610
Teacher, trust me, she's super cute.

532
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,391
You're still a kid and you don't know.

533
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:39,850
Looks aren't everything.

534
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,776
It's time for Miss Zara's class. Double time!

535
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,680
If you want to see people running after money,

536
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,110
Come to the Stock Exchange.

537
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,090
I've seen it outside, too.

538
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,010
All people do is chase money.

539
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,620
Earning your riches, eh?

540
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,600
I've left my job.

541
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,980
Why?

542
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,070
I've come to earn my riches.

543
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,475
You're alright, aren't you, boyo?

544
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:35,680
Yes, I'm fine.

545
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,346
Nope.

546
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,200
There's something that I can see more visibly on your face than before.

547
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,588
What is it?

548
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,750
Tell me.

549
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,170
Specks of dust from my last journey.

550
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,760
I'll wash it off in a moment.

551
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,155
You've come here on a bike?

552
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,545
Anyway...

553
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,868
How are Mehwish and Rumi?

554
00:32:58,868 --> 00:33:01,010
All good and merry?

555
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,020
I've never asked Rumi,

556
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,186
But Mehwish sure is merry.

557
00:33:06,638 --> 00:33:07,160
Anyway,

558
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,100
Have something.

559
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,163
You've just had one sip of tea.

560
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:12,610
I'll have the tea.

561
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,910
Alright.

562
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,330
So, what brings you here?

563
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,390
I've come here to invest.

564
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,560
Right. How much money do you have?

565
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,814
7.8 million.

566
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:22,560
Splendid.

567
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,446
So, ol' chap's been earning his riches, eh?

568
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:27,470
I've sold my flat.

569
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,050
Dad had bought it.

570
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,620
Oh.

571
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,720
Alright, I'll get you through to my portfolio,

572
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,190
You can know which shares to purchase.

573
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,683
Just Shehwar Chemicals.

574
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,009
Shehwar Chemicals?

575
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:42,360
As in, you'd invest everything in Shehwar Chemicals?

576
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,540
Yes.

577
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,720
Did someone tell you to?

578
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,670
I'm telling you.

579
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:50,340
Its shares have dropped from 60 Rupees to 12.10 in 6 days,

580
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,050
And it's likely that it'll drop below face value.

581
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,670
It won't drop below face value.

582
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,450
How do you know?

583
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,850
Gut feeling...

584
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh!

585
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,740
You're telling me!

586
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,380
Alright.

587
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,550
Not bad.

588
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,370
Even if you face a loss, it won't be too much.

589
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,945
I said I won't face a loss.

590
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,783
Mustafa!

591
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:16,858
How much for Shehwar Chemicals?

592
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,694
11.20 Rupees.

593
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:21,620
Ask him to purchase as many shares as 7.8 million can get.

594
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,550
Wait for 2 hours, boyo,

595
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,530
It'll come down to face value.

596
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,670
It won't.

597
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,020
Tell him not to wait and buy them.

598
00:34:30,876 --> 00:34:32,671
Right,

599
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,050
Purchase 700,000 shares.

600
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,723
I'm saying, purchase them.

601
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,361
How much?

602
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,019
Don't look at me, just tell me the amount.

603
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,100
7.740 million Rupees.

604
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,460
7.740...

605
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,645
And your commission?

606
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:58,036
Shut up, boyo...

607
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,683
You can get this cheque encashed.

608
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,170
What's up with you?

609
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,010
Why have you left your job?

610
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,010
I thought that when everyone's earning his riches,

611
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,280
Do I have a screw loose?

612
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,130
And

613
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,694
Who's recommended Shehwar Chemicals?

614
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:24,894
Some people at the bistro

615
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,020
Where I have my breakfast were talking about it.

616
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,000
I believed what they said.

617
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,520
Rubbish.

618
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,780
Did you ask Mehwish?

619
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,980
I don't ask Mehwish anymore.

620
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,090
Oh?

621
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,950
When did that happen?

622
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,810
Ever since she divorced me and left.

623
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,570
What?

624
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,870
What's this cod? Where is she?

625
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,968
With someone else.

626
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:49,120
I'll take my leave.

627
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,873
What are you saying? Who's she with?

628
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,590
The owner of Shehwar Chemicals.

629
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,080
She's marrying him.

630
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,216
Well, if it isn't the Reverend from our University!

631
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,040
How are you?

632
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,250
How are you?

633
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,400
And how is that bonnie lass?

634
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,060
I have to go, Ayesha...

635
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,160
Where do you have to go? Sit.

636
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
No --

637
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,280
Let him go today.

638
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,770
Don't stop him today.

639
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,910
We'll meet again.

640
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,460
Alright?

641
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,870
Goodbye.

642
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,330
What's happened to him?

643
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,390
That which should never happen.

644
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,910
The two have been divorced.

645
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,170
Mehwish and Danish?

646
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,610
I don't believe you...

647
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,683
She's marrying the owner of Shehwar Chemicals.

648
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,940
Hello?

649
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,940
Hello?

650
00:36:54,426 --> 00:36:56,294
Hello...?

651
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,117
Yes?

652
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:35,950
I'm getting calls from America on the landline.

653
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:39,560
The bell rings, and I answer it, but nobody says anything.

654
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,820
Where's Diwan?

655
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,480
He'd be somewhere around here.

656
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,720
Alright, disconnect.

657
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,130
Don't answer the phone if you get a call again.

658
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,900
Why?

659
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,751
Didn't I just say, don't answer it?

660
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,796
Yes?

661
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,020
It's down to 10.30.

662
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,570
So?

663
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,470
There's still time. Bear this small loss and sell them.

664
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,390
How long before the market closes?

665
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,060
2 hours.

666
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,600
Then, ask how much the share costs when the market closes.

667
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,260
See you.

668
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,442
Goodness...

669
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,590
Yes, Mr Mushtaq?

670
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:12,652
It's 2 right now; I'd be there by 3.

671
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,920
I'll look for it.

672
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,750
Alright, bye.

673
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,146
Come.

674
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:38,302
You won't find a 500 sq. yard furnished home in Karachi at this rate again, M. Danish!

675
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:41,040
I can give it in writing.

676
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,518
150,000 a month?

677
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,356
Yes.

678
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,300
As if it's a small amount!

679
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,696
Plus, 11 months' worth of advance...

680
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:53,837
Don't you like it?

681
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,070
I do like it, but...

682
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,420
It's tiny.

683
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,650
This 500 sq. yard home is tiny?

684
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,030
Well, it'd do. It's fine.

685
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,090
Seal the deal for ten days from now.

686
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,090
But you'd said you're in a hurry.

687
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,905
I'm saying it because I'm in a hurry.

688
00:40:12,905 --> 00:40:14,933
Here...

689
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,259
Here's 50,000 in advance.

690
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,714
Just a minute.

691
00:40:23,483 --> 00:40:24,358
Hello?

692
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,630
Yes, Salman?

693
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,960
Honestly,

694
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,590
Who told you that the share would go upwards?

695
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,240
I'd told you, some people at the bistro were talking about it.

696
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,160
Why, what happened?

697
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,360
2.50 Rupees!

698
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,110
Sell them, Danish.

699
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,840
Sell them right now!

700
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,300
Whoever gave you that membership, mate?

701
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,410
You say, 'Sell them' when the share goes up,

702
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,020
And 'Sell them' when it goes down.

703
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,080
Just wait and watch what happens.

704
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,668
I'll sell them after 8 days.

705
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:53,850
How much is the rent for this again?

706
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,210
How much is the rent for this again?
-150,000 a month.

707
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:58,790
For a 500 sq. yard furnished home...

708
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,210
For a 500 sq. yard furnished home...
-Yes.

709
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,000
It's a trifle, Mr Mushtaq.

710
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
