1
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,600
Alright, Anoushay, they're waiting. C'mon.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,546
Alright, Anoushay, they're waiting. C'mon.
-C'mon.

3
00:00:21,546 --> 00:00:23,021
Right...

4
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,837
I'm Maham.

5
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:02,540
Shehwar

6
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,220
Shehwar Ahmed's

7
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,795
Shehwar Ahmed's wife.

8
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,050
What's up?

9
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,773
I'm beholding my affluence.

10
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:32,911
There, now.

11
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:34,404
I'm honest.

12
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:37,094
If I ever feel that I don't have much money in my pockets,

13
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:40,400
I pull out the wallet and look at your picture;

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,986
In but a moment, a gust of opulence overwhelms me.

15
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,940
There's nothing like that, my dear.

16
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,646
I'm happy with how you keep me.

17
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,778
I love you.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,366
Honestly, Danish?

19
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,650
We can't live together anymore.

20
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,720
Crazy lass, I can't live without you.

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,246
But I can.

22
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,096
And I want to.

23
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,890
Why do you trouble yourself for a woman

24
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,146
Who isn't even ready to be loyal to you?

25
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,536
Hello?

26
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:57,706
Hania here.

27
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,959
Yes, Hania? What is it?

28
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:01,856
Do you even bother about Rumi?

29
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:03,356
Why? What happened?

30
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:05,650
Did you ever feel that I didn't care about him?

31
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,596
Yes.

32
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:08,367
Where are you?

33
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,330
I'm outside.

34
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,648
And where is he?

35
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:13,948
He's at home.

36
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:15,909
So that's how you're caring for him.

37
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:23,249
A child of the age of 6 is alone at home, waiting for you, and this is how you think you're caring for him?

38
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,300
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

39
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,524
10 minutes from now, yes,

40
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:28,985
What'd you do tomorrow?

41
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,735
Or the day after?

42
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:34,786
Obviously, you'd be out of the house if you run a business.

43
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:37,005
You'd have to leave for work often.

44
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,950
Sometimes, you'd even like to hang out with the lads.

45
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,480
So, please look for a permanent solution, would you?

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,080
How?

47
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,906
Who's with the kid when he's at home?

48
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,740
His Mum.

49
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,800
Granted that his Mum's left and is never coming back

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,869
It's not as if the world has ended!

51
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,480
No, sir, the world is as it was!

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,390
The same old!

53
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,030
Get married ASAP!

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,920
You don't have to worry either,

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,980
He's found someone for you, too.

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,730
He's friends with her, too.

57
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,636
There won't be any issues with a stepmom.

58
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,177
Do you know her?

59
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:13,536
No.

60
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,818
But he does.

61
00:04:15,818 --> 00:04:19,729
Trust me, he's a rapscallion, but his choice ain't bad.

62
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,620
As in, you haven't the foggiest about who she is.

63
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,110
I just told you.

64
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,290
I've asked him to introduce me to her a few times, but he says, 'It's confidential. I won't introduce you to her'.

65
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,596
I've seen her.

66
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,347
Splendid.

67
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,068
I've met her, too.

68
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,118
Right...

69
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:37,930
How do you like her?

70
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,219
She's very cute.

71
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:42,046
Here's an idea - introduce me to her,

72
00:04:42,046 --> 00:04:44,487
I'll talk to her.

73
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:47,717
You won't be able to talk if you heard her name.

74
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,977
You're underestimating me.

75
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:51,387
Should I tell you her name?

76
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,937
Yes?

77
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:56,179
He's talking about you.

78
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,176
Who are you?

79
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:38,007
What are you doing at my house?

80
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,060
I think you don't know who I am.

81
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,708
Mr Shehwar, I've got an arrest warrant for you.

82
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,787
What warrant?

83
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,220
What have I done?

84
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,290
Fraud and forgery,

85
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,227
Illegal transfer of funds,

86
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:49,940
And...

87
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,490
And...
-And?

88
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,223
And transferring 1 billion US Dollars through an IOU.

89
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,100
Lies!

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,160
Baseless!

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,226
Prove that in court.

92
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,200
C'mon.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,466
Where?

94
00:06:00,466 --> 00:06:04,300
We're throwing a grand pre-wedding party for you at the lockup. Come,

95
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,260
Or these nice folks here would have to shove you into the car.

96
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,487
Who's the complainant?

97
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:09,848
Your wife,

98
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:10,910
Maham Syed.

99
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,740
Maham?

100
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,682
Have a good day, dear husband.

101
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,071
Enjoy the party.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,510
Shall we?

103
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,336
I want to talk to my lawyer.

104
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:28,536
Sure.

105
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:32,541
I'll get you through as soon as we get there.

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,346
What are you looking at?

107
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,690
Tell them to stand down.

108
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,626
It's so insulting!

109
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:48,739
Oh, this is just the beginning...

110
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:52,730
Just wait and watch what I'll do to you in court!

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,159
Now, get lost!

112
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,943
Should I drop you?

113
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,496
No. I've come on my bike.

114
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:57,580
Then, please get going.

115
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,210
The groom's left already.

116
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,896
Alright.

117
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,710
What are you?

118
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,090
In fact, ask yourself -

119
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,120
Whatever is left of you now?

120
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,950
Do you know why I didn't send you with your boyfriend today?

121
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,977
Because he's been caught today.

122
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:19,447
He'll be presented before court tomorrow and the trial will begin.

123
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:24,795
But it'd be months before he gets punished.

124
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:27,606
But you've been tried.

125
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,023
Sentenced, too.

126
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,725
Pack your things and get out of here.

127
00:09:36,725 --> 00:09:41,390
A long term of imprisonment awaits you outside.

128
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,927
But where would I go?

129
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:47,770
And -- How would I, I don't even --

130
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,276
Diwan!

131
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:52,377
Give her some money.

132
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:57,697
Give her far more than she's expecting.

133
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,990
I'd better not see your face

134
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,239
When I come upstairs again,

135
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,930
Because you're so beautiful

136
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,330
That I envy you,

137
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,610
Yet, so ugly

138
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,261
That I feel like spitting in your face.

139
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,240
Alright, Ma'am, you may get off here.

140
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,676
I'd been told to drop you here.

141
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,416
N -- No...

142
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,050
Please, not here.

143
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,830
Drop me over there --

144
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,206
At the building that used to be my home.

145
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,817
Alright, I'll take you there.

146
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:08,741
But you know that they've left.

147
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,730
Either way, please drop me there.

148
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,090
Alright, Ma'am. I'll take you there.

149
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,426
I've seen that man very closely, Mme. Maham,

150
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:58,610
His face would be drained of all its colour when he'd come here.

151
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,277
He'd be restless,

152
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:03,740
Laughing even at things

153
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,720
One would cry to see.

154
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,440
It was etched clearly on his face that his wife

155
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,306
Was cheating on him,

156
00:12:13,306 --> 00:12:15,626
And, even then,

157
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:18,180
He wanted to stop her.

158
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,950
Perhaps for his son,

159
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,791
Or his love...

160
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,816
Did he beat her?

161
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,440
No.

162
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,578
Looking at him, one wouldn't even think he'd ever raise his voice at her.

163
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:40,750
I wouldn't believe it even if someone told me so.

164
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,357
A man, yet so merciful?

165
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,920
You must be mistaken, Diwan.

166
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,230
If a woman gets such love,

167
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,261
She ignores everything she lacks.

168
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,500
The bloke must have been beating her,

169
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,929
Demeaning her...

170
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,946
That's why it happened -

171
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:13,690
The woman asked someone else her worth.

172
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,000
And how did <i>he</i> keep her?

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,016
Very happy.

174
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:23,287
Then, everything was fine, Diwan.

175
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,500
Why did you call me, then?

176
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,648
My heart felt

177
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:31,730
That it's all temporary,

178
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,900
That she's come here because she wants more than her husband can earn,

179
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,486
And he's brought her because he has a lot of money to give.

180
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,406
The poor woman.

181
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't pity her, Mme. Maham!

182
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,710
A woman who separates from her own

183
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,356
To seek a union with another man

184
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:59,426
Is never worth pity.

185
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,026
Then, why did I feel such pity for her when I sent her?

186
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:09,856
She'd fallen face-first when you'd seen her.

187
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:12,767
That's why you felt pity.

188
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,728
But when I'd seen her,

189
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,620
She used to soar high,

190
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,990
Without even bothering

191
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,746
To look at those on the ground.

192
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,660
Where'd she go?

193
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,380
I mean,

194
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,700
Where'd she go at this hour of the night?

195
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,056
I don't know, but

196
00:14:36,056 --> 00:14:37,630
Just for once,

197
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,446
She'd go

198
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,360
Where she'd come from.

199
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,967
Why?

200
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:46,850
After all, she'd divorced her husband.

201
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,726
What'd she get there?

202
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,816
Or is it

203
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:56,170
That he's the kind who'd take her back?

204
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,496
In either case,

205
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:01,947
<i>She</i> would go there once.

206
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:03,080
Why?

207
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,030
That's how it is, Mme. Maham.

208
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,786
If a murderer gets acquitted before completing his prison term,

209
00:15:10,786 --> 00:15:16,397
He visits the place where he'd committed the murder once.

210
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,930
Shall I serve dinner?

211
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,241
No.

212
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,870
I'm so satisfied today

213
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,260
That it feels

214
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,856
That I'm full.

215
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,390
Good evening.
-Good evening.

216
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:06,802
Where's he gone after selling the flat?

217
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:10,080
Didn't I tell you the other day that I don't know?

218
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,736
Please, find out.

219
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:13,906
I want to meet my son.

220
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:16,737
I can give you some money -- Here --

221
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,769
I have 10,000 here -- Please take all of it --
-No, Ma'am, I don't want any money.

222
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,550
Not a penny.

223
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,160
Just call him.

224
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,617
Ask him to tell you.

225
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,570
Even if I found out,

226
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,461
I won't tell you.

227
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,790
You may go, now, Ma'am.

228
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,071
Most people in the building don't know about <i>it</i>.

229
00:17:54,071 --> 00:17:55,690
All they know

230
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,546
Is that you've gone to another city

231
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,467
And he's gone to live with you.

232
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,357
So, it's better if you leave, Ma'am.

233
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:03,650
It's better if such things don't come out.

234
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,140
May the Lord help you.

235
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,766
May the Lord help you.
<i>I had been so blear-eyed</i>

236
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,816
<i>I had been so blear-eyed</i>

237
00:18:08,816 --> 00:18:12,587
<i>And a sinner all along</i>

238
00:18:12,587 --> 00:18:15,668
<i>Yet, all along</i>

239
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:21,019
<i>I've captivated your heart</i>

240
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:31,500
<i>Forgive my sins, thinking, if nothing else,</i>

241
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:40,009
<i>That you've missed me so much...</i>

242
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:54,087
What are you doing?

243
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:56,647
Taking the SIM out.

244
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,856
What happened?

245
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,011
Nothing, really.

246
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,212
I thought...

247
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:14,132
I have to talk to Dad's friends every now and then. I have to tell them that he's no more...

248
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:17,353
It hurts me so much.

249
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,137
Here.

250
00:19:19,137 --> 00:19:20,917
Keep it.

251
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:22,948
What happened?

252
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:25,940
What do you mean?

253
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,370
It's Danish who's been calling you on Dad's phone for the last few days,

254
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,096
Or Rumi, who called that one time.

255
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:37,026
Who's calling you every now and then that's hurting you so much?

256
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:38,826
I'm sleepy...

257
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,365
I can't think of a single night in the past year when you've gone to bed at 10.30.

258
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,210
Yes,

259
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,261
There was that one time...

260
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,103
You had a fever.

261
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,110
The doctor had given you sleeping pills.

262
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,816
I've taken sleeping pills.

263
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:57,463
Why?

264
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:03,607
Because -- I felt I'd have a fever.

265
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,231
You're hiding something, aren't you?

266
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,870
As if a fever's something one would hide...

267
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,210
Please, go now, I'm actually sleepy.

268
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,046
Should I give you Dad's diary?

269
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,246
Why?

270
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:23,667
Read it again before you go to bed.

271
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:27,597
Go through what Dad's written on its last few pages.

272
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,447
Good night.

273
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,856
I accept this proposal.

274
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,636
From now on, we're partners. 50-50.

275
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:58,156
Perfect.

276
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,676
Here, ol' chap.

277
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,199
Rumi!

278
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:13,257
Maman?

279
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,287
Why don't you meet me?

280
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,428
Papa's told you not to?

281
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:30,898
No. I'd told Papa not to.

282
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,620
Look over there. Papa's car.

283
00:22:40,142 --> 00:22:43,083
You may go. She's my Maman.

284
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,687
How are you, Maman?

285
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:53,854
I'm fine.

286
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:56,966
May I go? I'm getting late.

287
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,467
May I come sometimes?

288
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,937
Here?

289
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:09,667
No. My friends would ask me who you are.

290
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,230
Just tell them

291
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,490
'It's my Maman'!

292
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,026
I won't.

293
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:19,333
They'd ask me why you meet me at the school gates.

294
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,977
Give me your phone number.

295
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:25,141
I'll talk to you over the phone.

296
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,586
Don't you miss me?

297
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,907
I do, Maman.

298
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,956
Don't you feel like meeting me?

299
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:41,077
I do, Maman.

300
00:23:42,766 --> 00:23:44,566
Then, why did you say,

301
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,530
'I'd talk to you over the phone'?

302
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,946
I'm getting late, Maman...

303
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,861
What've you become, Rumi...

304
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,620
May I come to meet you once a week?
-Once a week?

305
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,136
A week goes by so quickly.

306
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,493
Once a month. Okay?

307
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,280
Bye!

308
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,146
A woman showed up at the school gates, sir.

309
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:27,792
She pulled li'l Rumi into an embrace the moment she saw him.

310
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,883
She started kissing his face and forehead. She was crying, too.

311
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:35,020
And Rumi said, 'You may go',

312
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,436
'She's my Maman'.

313
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,286
Oh?

314
00:25:40,286 --> 00:25:43,297
Is she actually his Mum, sir?

315
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,043
Yes.

316
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,130
Congratulations!

317
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,650
Thank you!

318
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,296
Come. Let me show you your office.

319
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,226
This is your office.

320
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:07,897
Good?

321
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:09,427
Very good.

322
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,017
Look at this painting here.

323
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:13,928
Guess who's made it.

324
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,328
You?

325
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,239
Yes.

326
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,380
In two days.

327
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,656
I've made it for you.

328
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:20,932
That's what you're like.

329
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,337
From the outside, and deep inside.

330
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,280
Surely, I'm not so colourful.

331
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,516
You are.

332
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,894
She's just drained you of all your colour.

333
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:29,846
So what?

334
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:31,913
Get your colour back.

335
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,626
Become colourful again.

336
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,397
Alright.

337
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:37,000
Come here. Sit.

338
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,157
Here.

339
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,616
I'll take a picture of you.

340
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,520
Come and sit.

341
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,980
Ready?

342
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,946
Just a second.

343
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,560
Ready?

344
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,157
At least smile!

345
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,240
Yes,

346
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,320
You'd manage the portfolio.

347
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,326
He'd just tell you which shares to buy and sell.

348
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:02,470
But what'd I do, Salman?

349
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,010
I mean --

350
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,110
I'd only be a portfolio manager in name.

351
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,136
Yes.

352
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:11,501
Just like I'm the CEO only in name.

353
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,711
Sit.

354
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:14,791
Please, boyo, sit.

355
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,796
Look,

356
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:25,677
One's got to understand a few things, learn some.

357
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:28,470
Do you play cricket?

358
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,980
Yes.

359
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,477
Haven't you seen

360
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,690
That the one-down batsman is not quite in form,

361
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,490
But number 9 does steals the show.

362
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,660
He may be batsman #10 of the stock market,

363
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,190
But he's in form,

364
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,070
And my intuition says he's on his way to score a century.

365
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,330
Just close your eyes.

366
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,786
If he says, 'Buy this share', buy it,

367
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:53,010
And if he says, 'Sell this share', sell it.

368
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,800
Let's see how your portfolio's been doing after 15 days.

369
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,720
I've not seen a man so superstititious as you at the Stock Exchange, Salman.

370
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,530
Just wait and watch,

371
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,937
If it turned out as I'm thinking, I'd tell you that I wasn't superstitious at all.

372
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,510
Sure?

373
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,190
Sure.

374
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,806
Rumi!

375
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,496
Yes, teacher?

376
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:07,066
What are you doing here?

377
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,920
I was reading... Fell asleep...

378
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,947
Do you know you've missed a class?

379
00:30:11,947 --> 00:30:14,070
I'm sorry...

380
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,726
Sit.

381
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,407
Are you upset?

382
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,838
Worried?

383
00:30:25,838 --> 00:30:27,652
Yes.

384
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,660
You've even met your Maman in the morning,

385
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,040
And you're still upset?

386
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:36,662
What happened?

387
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:38,233
Any problem?

388
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:41,480
She says she loves me so much.

389
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,230
What's wrong about that?

390
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,357
Maman always loves so much...

391
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,397
Not always, teacher.

392
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:54,330
She takes a 4-month leave. More than my summer holidays.

393
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,670
The thing is, there'd been some problems then...

394
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,957
When there's problems between Maman and Papa, there are 'holidays' like that...

395
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:05,167
The problem's still there.

396
00:31:06,428 --> 00:31:10,619
Maman's just met me. She hasn't met Papa yet.

397
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,340
Right...

398
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,800
The problem's still there...

399
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,196
Do you know that she was crying so much? She hadn't even come by her car.

400
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:19,340
Are you sure?

401
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,606
Yes, teacher. She'd left on a rickshaw.

402
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,196
How could that be...

403
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:28,760
Papa says they've got a lot of money.

404
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,640
She always used to come by car.

405
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,616
A big one.

406
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:37,547
That's why Papa's bought a big car.

407
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,517
It's time for my class, okay?

408
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,637
I'll get going.

409
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,546
Over here, Ma'am.

410
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,646
Shehwar...

411
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,056
You?

412
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:31,240
Here?

413
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,057
Why have you come?

414
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:35,118
Enough of -- Just go!

415
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:38,308
Go back to your husband.

416
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,636
If my wife found out you came here to meet me, she'd have me hung!

417
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:45,970
Just go, will you?

418
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,026
I can't even get a bail.

419
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:54,990
You didn't tell anyone around here your name, did you?

420
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,856
I've written my name - Mehwish.

421
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:01,717
Go back.

422
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:04,038
Get your name out of there.

423
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,770
Just say that your name's not Mehwish!

424
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,260
An --

425
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,960
Anoushay. That's right.

426
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,291
Just go, will you?

427
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,610
We have seen good moments together, mate...

428
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,332
Please do me this favour.

429
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,810
Who are you, Shehwar Ahmed?

430
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,336
Who?

431
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,816
Eh?

432
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:27,886
Who do you think I am?

433
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:30,486
Do I look like Danish?

434
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:33,707
Hey!

435
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,306
Who is she?

436
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,670
Please, take her away. I don't even know her.

437
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,316
Why have you come to meet me?

438
00:33:41,316 --> 00:33:43,596
Please, go!

439
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,170
Your wife was right.

440
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,430
She said to me, 'What are you'?

441
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,910
'In fact, how say you tell me',

442
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,300
'Whatever is left of you now'?

443
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,146
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

444
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:29,660
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

445
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:35,086
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

446
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:39,696
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

447
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:54,692
Maman, she's crying like you, too.

448
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,686
Come here.

449
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,597
Sit.

450
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,557
Hello?

451
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:31,036
Hello...

452
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:33,147
Is this Salman Ibrahim?

453
00:35:33,147 --> 00:35:34,697
Yes, who are you?

454
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:37,128
It's Mehwish, Salman.

455
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:39,509
Your class-fellow.

456
00:35:39,509 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey! Where'd you drop in from?

457
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,630
How are you?

458
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,830
I'm fine.

459
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,686
And you?

460
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,630
Fine...

461
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,730
And how's he...

462
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,511
Danish?

463
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,760
Don't ask about him.

464
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,370
Why?

465
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:03,036
He's alive, isn't he?

466
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,960
No -- We --

467
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,150
I'm in a problem, Salman.

468
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,320
Can you please help me?

469
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,862
Go on.

470
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:17,550
I need a job.

471
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,867
Where are you?

472
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:21,297
Nowhere...

473
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,970
Alright,

474
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,338
I'll text you my address.

475
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:28,200
Meet me in the evening.

476
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,131
We'll talk.

477
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,801
Thank you.

478
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,581
Yeah.

479
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,116
Papa!

480
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,166
Rumi!

481
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,700
What's up? You're extra loving today!

482
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,616
I've been missing you.

483
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,420
You liar!

484
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,926
Tell me,

485
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:08,977
What is it?

486
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:13,197
I'm honest, Papa, I was missing you.

487
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:16,870
Do you know what I used to think of you before sending you to school?

488
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,180
What?

489
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,160
A duffer.

490
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,810
But you're an absolute rapscallion.

491
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:27,207
You were just waiting for me to send you to school so you can give yourself airs.

492
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,321
Papa!

493
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,296
When I went to school today, Maman was standing there.

494
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:35,876
She hugged me and started crying.

495
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:38,901
She was crying so much, Papa.

496
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,626
I know.

497
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:54,347
Papa, I was thinking that if she hugged you and cried like that,

498
00:37:54,347 --> 00:37:58,840
You would've just said 'It's okay' and brought her home.

499
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,220
Done your homework?

500
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,670
A long while ago.

501
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,746
Alright, I'll go and change.

502
00:38:04,746 --> 00:38:06,137
We'll have dinner.

503
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:09,956
She didn't have her car, Papa. She'd come on a rickshaw.

504
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:12,540
She went back on a rickshaw, too.

505
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,256
It seemed like she'd come to say sorry.

506
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,336
Go and tell the cook to serve dinner.

507
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:21,446
I'm coming.

508
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:22,837
Okay?

509
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,380
She didn't have her car, Papa. She'd come on a rickshaw.

510
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,020
She went back on a rickshaw, too.

511
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,666
It seemed like she'd come to say sorry.

512
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,086
Hello?

513
00:39:02,086 --> 00:39:03,437
Watching TV?

514
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:05,872
No. I've just gotten home.

515
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:08,350
So, you haven't heard the news, have you?

516
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,980
What news?

517
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,608
The FIA [Federal Investigation Agency] have arrested Shehwar Ahmed.

518
00:39:13,608 --> 00:39:17,179
His wife's snatched everything from him.

519
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,902
No comments?

520
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,620
No comments.

521
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:25,840
Alright.

522
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,381
I'll disconnect.

523
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:29,262
Bye.

524
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
