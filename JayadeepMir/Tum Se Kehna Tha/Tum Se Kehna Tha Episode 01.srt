1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, Ruby, I want someone simple, mature, and modest who can take care of me... The household... And Faris!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... Yeah, I know there's many in the family... But you know about all their 'issues'!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll get back to you. Bye.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was wondering what's going on here... I heard everything.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it's Mission: Find a dream daughter-in-law these days!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, dream daughter-in-law?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the one I like is gonna be my dream girl, the one you like is gonna be your dream daughter-in-law, of course.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be good for you. I want the best for you.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember Mrs Chauhdry? The lady you met the other day?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's introducing us to someone tomorrow. She was praising her family so much!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've got such a vast social circle. Why don't you look there? You're trusting a complete stranger!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm not gonna pick someone who's so busy with herself she hasn't got a moment for you!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking for in her?
-Respect, simplicity, modesty... In other words, a family-girl.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow... Good luck with that...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, what's for dinner?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday roast.
-Blimey...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go change...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is so... Breathtaking... I could spend my whole life this way.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Live all your dreams with me...

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout we start right away?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa! Easy there!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jaysus, mate... What is it?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it, more like. Who are you dreaming of?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme sleep, Yusra...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up. I'm getting late for work because of you. You want to be late for college?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rabi!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, Rabi...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun's come up!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, it's such a beautiful thing!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't bother...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Mum... Seems she just wants to skive off...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- Why?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun doesn't wait to come up when you want. Quickly, now... I'll be waiting at breakfast.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget to have breakfast before you leave!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yusra...
-Yeah?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you come to the shop with me in the evening?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No... You know I'm knackered after office... I'll get what you want on the way back.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about... A friend's birthday... Gotta get her a gift... Would you happen to have some money? I'll go with Mum.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm... I don't think I've got any...

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate... I'm going to the bank. I'll transfer some to you. Get it from the ATM.

46
00:04:21,186 --> 00:04:24,956
Thank you so much. I know you started working just for me!

47
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:26,487
Of course.

48
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:29,027
Because you're my queen!

49
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:34,462
Thank you so much!
-Eww! Get off me! Go brush your teeth!

50
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:35,838
Go!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello... Ready to go to work?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. I'll get your medicines on the way back, but! Don't forget to check your blood pressure.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Doc.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I think of you as my sons...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I trust the two of you more than myself. That's why I let you work as you wanted.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, how are you going to the office?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Same as everyday? I've ordered a taxi and it's almost here... Okay, bye!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, take care!
-Take care.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your cuppa!
-Thank you!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's our young lad Rabi up to?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your lad's off her head. Still busy getting ready, I guess...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I'm waiting for you.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, come to the pinned location and call me.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rabi...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you too busy dressing up of late?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So mind yourself. You're grown up now!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grown-ups busy themselves with dressing up. Not kids!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lippy as always! You don't have to answer back every time!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... You only answer questions!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jaysus... When'll you grow up?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I'm saying...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, forget it... You'll say I'm being immature again!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could learn a thing or two from your sister.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think everyone who earns money is mature?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who said anything about money?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yusra's very practical. She's working because she wants to.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know just as well your Dad's pension is all we need.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww, turn the frown upside-down, Mum... Cheer up!

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now... You can stop buttering me up... And come have bread and butter!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't feel like having anything in the morning.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate it how these films and dramas are making unfed skeletons of girls! Have something before going to college!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not dieting or something, Mum... Just don't feel like having anything.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord... I pray we find a match for Yusra so I can get you married off as well!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I've sorted that out myself.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you done?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I contacted Fish Aplenty.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll be here anyday...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's Fish Aplenty?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll tell you everything you need to know. Don't worry.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Yusra tells me everything when she's back from work... Why don't you tell me anything when you get back?

94
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,685
What do I tell you about college? It's all classes, classes, and ah, yes, boredom that kills you!

95
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:13,205
Anyway, come have breakfast...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, not this one... Pack this.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack this one. Thank you!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean, 'Pack this one'?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm buying this one. Please pack it.
-Excuse me, but I told them to keep it for me...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean 'keep it for you'? I've picked this one after so much time!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was here before you. I told them to keep it for me. I don't know why it was even on display... Tell her, will you?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, ma'am, but he's already paid for it. Someone must've put it on display by mistake...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me! What d'you mean he paid for it? I'm paying for it right now. Pack it for me!

104
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:56,409
Just in case you didn't notice, it's for men.

105
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,409
Who are you to tell me that?

106
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:04,400
If you kept on bothering me, I'll raise a crowd right here!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's okay.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack this one.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, please...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.
-You'll have to pay for it over there.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not expect me to say thank you or something!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay...

113
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:34,241
Good afternoon. Saba Chauhdry. Mobile marriage bureau at your doorstep. Here with the best matches made in Heaven!

114
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,700
(No money back guarantee in case of divorces, estrangement, or cheating.)

115
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,591
May I come in?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't it a bit too hot in here?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scorching, yeah.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And look at me... Waiting for you in this heat...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's got brains, but few bother to use them! Who told you to wait right outside the door, Yasir? You could've waited in the car!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Worried someone may see you?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know I don't get worried.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but I do... So worried my heart skips a beat!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww... No need to get so romantic!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall we?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw you in my dream last night.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No surprise... You don't see me much when awake.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, you tripped and fell!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I fell for you long ago...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray someone comes with a proposal real quick!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to you in advance...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up! I'm talking about Yusra.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be my turn once she's been married off.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you're smart!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum doesn't think so. She thinks I'm immature.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because no one knows you better than me.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout we have some ice cream today?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd have lunch...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'd have to have whatever Mum's cooked... She won't let me go.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, before I forget again... Whose car is it?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mine, of course?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you have that white car?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to send it to the garage for repairs, you know... This one's mine - <i>ours</i> - too. Get it, smart girl?</i>

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't like, I'm sure I can get another --
-No way, I love it.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you. Shall we?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good afternoon!
-Good afternoon.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saba Chauhdry. I've got the perfect match for your daughter.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright... Please, take a seat!

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, I -- Sorry, gotta take this one...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, what's up, Shabana?

156

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your younger daughter Rabi got in touch with us. Sent us her sister's pictures too. For her marriage, you know...

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, we're looking for a match for her.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understand girls' parents have their hands full with worries, and I believe in lending a hand where I can.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, it doesn't look proper if they go about or come to our office to find a match for their daughters... That's why I provide this door-to-door service.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I appreciate your effort. It's so convenient for parents!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one thinks that way these days... Not for families with daughters, at least!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except me!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, I forgot to ask you... Would you like to have some tea?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thank you! Not in this heat! But yeah, I'd love it if you could get me a cold drink...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.
-Thank you!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What d'you do? Of course if you don't mind telling me...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would I?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm retired so... Not much these days...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, it's my health...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope it's nothing serious, I mean, like... Heart diseases... Kidney disorders... Or something?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness, no. Just... Allergies and the flu!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't see your daughters around. Where are they?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yusra would be at her office and Rabi at college.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very good... She's got a job... That's very nice...

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.
-Thank you so much!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. Your daughters are my responsibility now.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll find the best matches for them and get back to you!

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I said something, Mrs Chauhdry?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please come around when they're both home, so you can meet them yourself.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Their pictures won't nearly tell you well enough.
-Absolutely. I'll be back. Gotta pick my kids from school. I thought I'd drop by and see you first.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back. Thank you so much!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're welcome.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
-Bye.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Lord has been very kind...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, Yasir, bye!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi... You're?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saba Chauhdry. Mobile marriage bureau.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's you! How are you?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you meet them?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, just met your parents.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... You're Rabi? The one who got in touch with us and sent us your sister's pictures?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's he?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A friend from college...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's real handsome... Gimme his number. I've got many lovely matches for him!

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thank you, he's committed.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, you don't know how it is these days! Gimme his number.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you getting late, Yasir?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The thing is, they don't marry outside the family, so, you know...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cousin marriages, eh?
-Yeah.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His number plate's gonna tell me his number!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, give me yours?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My number? Come back and I'll give you.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, find someone good for my sister real quick!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, I'll do my best!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going. Bye.
-Okay, bye.

214
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:51,595
In'cha so clever, lil' wahn!

215
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,907
Wotcha?

216
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,987
Yeah, where's the bleedin' Jam Jar?

217
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,107
I'm at the front gate!

218
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:01,038
Quickly!

219
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,239
Jeez...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
