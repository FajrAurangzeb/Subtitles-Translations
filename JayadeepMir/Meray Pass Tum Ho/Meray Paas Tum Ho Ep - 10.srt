1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,397
Did you eat anything?

2
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,055
Didn't the maid cook anything?

3
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:29,160
She would've; I didn't take a look.

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,832
Alright, I'll get you some bread; you should have something.

5
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,742
No.

6
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,180
You're angry?

7
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,990
Yes.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,046
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,996
It's okay, Mehwish.

10
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,306
A --

11
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:02,626
Foreign delegation had come.

12
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,536
When Shehwar asked me to come,

13
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:08,976
I thought it'd be a good experience for me.

14
00:01:08,976 --> 00:01:11,322
Shall we sleep?

15
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:14,956
First, fix your mood.

16
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,520
What should I do? Laugh?

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,510
No...

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,376
Just smile in a way that feels like you're actually smiling.

19
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:27,294
Did you eat anything?

20
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,465
Yes,

21
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:31,205
On the flight.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,081
You must've travelled business class.

23
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:37,565
Yes.

24
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,150
Mind if I ask something?

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,920
Not at all.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,556
Didn't you think of how much I love you?

27
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,351
Oh, please leave that be.

28
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:11,671
When I said 'sorry', it means I made a mistake.

29
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:18,230
Tomorrow onwards, you're not going to office.

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,632
I'll manage everything.

31
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:24,052
How?

32
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:26,633
I'll take bribes.

33
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:30,233
I'll get you hundreds of thousands of Rupees a month if you want,

34
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,964
But you won't go to the office.

35
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,167
This brew is strong!

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,702
Would you like some butter on your slice?

37
00:03:23,702 --> 00:03:25,698
No...

38
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,942
How much

39
00:03:36,942 --> 00:03:40,792
Of the 500,000 is left?

40
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,484
I'd paid the school fees on my own.

41
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,420
Did you spend any?

42
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,348
Yes.

43
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,000
How much?

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,077
80 to 90 thousand?

45
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:01,267
No problem. It's not a big deal.

46
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:04,357
They'll be added up tomorrow.

47
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:05,985
And then?

48
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,926
Then, I'll give it to him,

49
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:11,356
And tell him that it's no longer needed.

50
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:16,285
Look, Danish, I've not committed a sin.

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,040
No, Mehwish,

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,050
Don't say that.

53
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,510
You have sinned,

54
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,867
It's just that I haven't said so.

55
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,796
Let's forget it.

56
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,990
Let's rewind our lives,

57
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,570
At least to the point

58
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,688
When there was no Shehwar Ahmed in our lives.

59
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:48,978
Let's start our life again.

60
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:51,262
He's a toff,

61
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:56,563
He's got a lot of money; he can even buy love if he wants,

62
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:00,460
But I'm wealthier than him, Mehwish,

63
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,440
For I can't sell my love.

64
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,009
It won't do this way.

65
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,630
Which way?

66
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,750
I can't live with my head bowed in shame before you.

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,960
No...

68
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,530
I can't hold my head high if your head is bowed.

69
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,130
Look up,

70
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,475
So I can hold my head high.

71
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,073
Do you know what he was saying on the way to the school?

72
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:37,300
'The two of you had a row, didn't you'?

73
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,641
I said, 'No'.

74
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,736
'When did you see us have a row'?

75
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,196
Do you know what he said?

76
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,427
He said,

77
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,462
'The two of you have a row'

78
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:52,037
'When you don't quarrel with each other'.

79
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,166
We'll have one to show him

80
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,310
When he gets back from the school.

81
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,817
He'd be delighted to see.

82
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:09,153
Why didn't you go to office?

83
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:10,700
It's nothing, really.

84
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,256
Mr Matin, you know,

85
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,700
The man in charge of the office?

86
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,526
He

87
00:06:15,526 --> 00:06:17,217
Notices me.

88
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:20,101
What does he notice?

89
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:22,321
If I get the chills,

90
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:23,598
Or I feel

91
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,528
That my heart's sinking, or if I have a headache,

92
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:29,420
He asks what the problem is.

93
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,130
He starts telling tales of himself two-timing.

94
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,086
He'd been disloyal to his wife.

95
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,896
Hearing it, I said,

96
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,767
'Mr Matin',

97
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,708
'I'm not your type'.

98
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,530
Go to the office.

99
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,670
But

100
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,686
It's 11 right now...

101
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,380
Just say that you've come now that you're better.

102
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,461
Oh, it's nothing like that... It's not as if the work comes to a halt if I'm not there.

103
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,070
And

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,707
I'd thought we'd spend time with each other

105
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,440
Before Rumi gets back.

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,267
I can even cook

107
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,176
If you like.

108
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:18,636
Don't say that, Danish.

109
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,369
I want no files for an hour.

110
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:50,276
Sure, sir.

111
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,306
I was in Islamabad yesterday; I was busy.

112
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:02,186
I'd disconnect right now if you go on with this cod!

113
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,200
Shut up!

114
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,493
Thank you very much.

115
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,430
Why have we come here?

116
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,800
There's no meeting here.

117
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,877
So?

118
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:47,230
Let's make it one

119
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,780
Between the two of us.

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,396
We'll sit,

121
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,500
Have tea,

122
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,870
And decide

123
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,786
Where

124
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,631
We're headed.

125
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,276
Where are we headed?

126
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,386
The return flight leaves at 6.

127
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,684
Doesn't it?

128
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,500
Get some rest.

129
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,020
You won't smoke.

130
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,456
The 6 p.m. flight's confirmed,

131
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,907
You'd land in Karachi at 8,

132
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,116
That's for sure.

133
00:09:31,116 --> 00:09:32,486
But

134
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:34,986
Must you go back to him

135
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:39,826
When we get back after going anywhere?

136
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:43,420
If you want to go back to him, why take the 6 p.m. flight?

137
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,140
Flights leave earlier, too.

138
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,595
Please, Shehwar,

139
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,840
He's very possessive.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,196
He won't let me go anywhere.
-The decision is always up to the one who goes, and not the one who stops.

141
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:58,977
I've seen it many times.

142
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:01,557
I'm sure you would've, too.

143
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:05,508
People get on the wrong train in their hurry.

144
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,468
What do they do?

145
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:09,447
Do they keep sitting?

146
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:12,937
Where'd they go if they kept sitting?

147
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:17,860
That is why they don't sit tight like you.

148
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:23,800
They wait for the next station, and get off the moment the train stops.

149
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:34,890
You have six hours.

150
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,818
Think about it and decide.

151
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:41,630
Just think

152
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,980
That we're almost at the next station.

153
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,156
Should I get off?

154
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:53,856
You'd have to, if you know you've gotten on the wrong train.

155
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,940
Knock on my door

156
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,790
If you decide to get off.

157
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,973
I have to get off, too.

158
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:10,809
I've left many stations behind, looking for you.

159
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,960
Have you fallen asleep?

160
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,116
No, I'm awake.

161
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:04,056
I'm going to get Rumi.

162
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:07,013
Okay.

163
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,830
Fix your mood, will you?

164
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,911
We're going out in the evening.

165
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,290
I'm alright.

166
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,836
Sir, I've talked to the driver;

167
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,476
He'd gone over to pick Ms Mehwish up,

168
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:12,186
But her husband sent him back.

169
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,000
He'd have said something about her health?

170
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, sir, her husband said, 'Don't come here again'.
-What?

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,381
Call her.

172
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,636
Wait.

173
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,741
Leave it be.

174
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,396
Hello.

175
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,307
There.

176
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,867
It's happened, innit?

177
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,188
What?

178
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,078
That's what I feared.

179
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:38,790
He'd shut every way out if he found out.

180
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,107
Would you keep fearing him like that?

181
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:47,106
What should I do?

182
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:52,546
Do exactly what you'd knocked on my door to tell me.

183
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,596
Do you remember?

184
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,697
I do.

185
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:04,327
But the sight of him at the airport is stuck in my eyes.

186
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:07,910
How did he figure out I'd be at the airport?

187
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:12,046
And that I'd be there right then?

188
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:15,470
This was bound to happen one day.

189
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,750
That day came too quickly, Shehwar.

190
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,530
I feel pity when I see him.

191
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,739
It's simple, mate,

192
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:27,570
You pity him, but you don't pity yourself.

193
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,517
Send in your resignation and live out your days with him.

194
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:33,190
I can change how you think,

195
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,110
But not your fate.

196
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,016
Why are you saying such things?

197
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,390
What should I say?

198
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,020
You don't pity me, you don't pity yourself,

199
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,770
But you pity the man

200
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,730
Who'd rather imprison the most priceless beauty of the world

201
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,121
In that rubbishy flat!

202
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,114
What's the solution?

203
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,140
Just get to the office.

204
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,730
That's not possible.

205
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,604
He'd have me write my resignation in the evening,

206
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:08,990
And leave the resignation with all of 500,000 on your table tomorrow.

207
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,970
Fair enough.

208
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,820
Nobody will stop me from smoking now.

209
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,560
Shehwar, please.

210
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,370
What should I do?

211
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,810
It's beyond me to come and take you,

212
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,740
Or ask your husband to take everything I have,

213
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,450
And give me my Mehwish.

214
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,470
Would you give him everything if he actually asked for it?

215
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,950
I swear by you, I would.

216
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,717
Are you there?

217
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,078
Yeah.

218
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,237
Do you know how I feel?

219
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,728
I've been distressed since the morning.

220
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:52,300
I'm furious every now and then.

221
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,670
I've smoked, too.

222
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:58,240
You're not going to smoke; full stop.

223
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,870
I think he's here; Bye.

224
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,563
Bye.

225
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,926
Hi!

226
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,360
Hi.

227
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,968
Where's good ol' Danish?

228
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,939
He's gone to get Rumi from the school.

229
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:28,080
Oh...

230
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,806
Tell him that the Building Management's meeting tomorrow

231
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:32,080
At 7 p.m.

232
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,010
Ask him to take some time out and come.

233
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,700
Sure, I'll tell him.

234
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,120
I'd like to tell you something if you don't mind.

235
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,070
Please, go on.

236
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:48,250
You're the most charming lady in the building.

237
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,536
Thank you.

238
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,066
Alright.

239
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,951
Alright, recite the poem for me, will you?

240
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,460
C'mon.

241
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,346
Go on.

242
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:32,745
Didn't you make any new friends today?

243
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:34,810
I did.

244
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,916
Who?

245
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,056
Almi, Hamza...

246
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:41,426
You mentioned Hamza yesterday. Didn't you say you make new friends everyday?

247
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:45,428
Maham, Raza, Mohammad Hasnain...

248
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,041
Greetings, Danish!

249
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,560
How are you, Rumi?

250
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,236
Ayat, Ayeza,

251
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,235
Maham, Raza, Mohammad Hasnain...

252
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,040
I'd like to tell you something if you don't mind.

253
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,836
You're the most charming lady in the building.

254
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,420
What should I say?

255
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,012
You don't pity me, you don't pity yourself,

256
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:13,772
But you pity the man

257
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:16,733
Who'd rather imprison the most priceless beauty of the world

258
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,903
In that rubbishy flat!

259
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,830
Rumi's back.

260
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,420
My sweet little one.

261
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,097
Got homework?
-So much!

262
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:41,390
What's this?

263
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,920
Burgers.

264
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,536
I thought

265
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,636
We won't cook at home today.

266
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:48,967
We'd have burgers in the afternoon and a pizza in the evening.

267
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,970
The pizza was my idea.

268
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,690
Okay, mate.

269
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,106
It was your idea.

270
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:57,386
Alright, have your burgers,

271
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,115
Do your homework, and go to sleep.

272
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:02,365
Okay.
-Alright; freshen up and come.

273
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,980
Why don't you have some, too?

274
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,226
They're delicious.

275
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,966
Yes, Mr Matin?

276
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,906
How are you, sir?

277
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:31,847
I hear you're not well?

278
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,448
I'm fine now.

279
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:36,970
I even thought I should come to the office, but my heart didn't quite agree to it.

280
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,746
I've grown rather close to you, Mr Danish; you're a proper good chap.

281
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,532
Seeing your chair empty,

282
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:45,567
I felt sad.

283
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,311
You're too kind, Mr Matin.

284
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,800
You sound like you're perfectly fine now!

285
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,036
Yes.

286
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:52,250
100%.

287
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,570
So, are we meeting tomorrow morning?

288
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,226
Sure.

289
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,967
And tell me about the cigarettes.

290
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,218
Do you still smoke?

291
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:00,840
I'd told you.

292
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,380
I don't smoke like the smokers.
-You hadn't told me, sir.

293
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,000
You'd told the peon and I overheard it.

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,610
I never smoke at home.

295
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,770
Oh!

296
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,370
So you fear your wife!

297
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,070
Yes -- Very much.

298
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,030
You're the first man I know who says that he fears his wife openly!

299
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,780
You'd live such a happy life! Take care.

300
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,640
See you in the morning.

301
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,197
Likewise.

302
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:26,751
Bye.
-Bye.

303
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,030
I want to get off at the next station, Shehwar.

304
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,136
Sure?

305
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,556
Sure.

306
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,696
Maman!

307
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:14,127
Maman, we're here and you didn't even realise it!

308
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,537
Alright.

309
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,536
Is there any problem? Why aren't the two of you talking?

310
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:02,777
No.

311
00:23:02,777 --> 00:23:04,160
It's nothing.

312
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,747
Say something, then, Papa.

313
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:11,134
You don't even say, 'Mehwish, you're spending so much'!

314
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,911
I would never say that.

315
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,382
Ice cream! Papa, ice cream!

316
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:47,933
Where -- Oh...

317
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,603
Stop here, will you?

318
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,536
Come here. Where are you off to?

319
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:04,087
Would you like to have an ice cream?

320
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,507
No.

321
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,821
Right...

322
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,260
Come.

323
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,820
How are you, Guard Uncle?

324
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,130
Fine!

325
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,960
We've just had an outing. We had pizza, too!

326
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,470
That's great!
-Here's an ice cream! Do you want some?

327
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,890
No, my wee Rumi will have this.

328
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,700
Rumi!

329
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,156
Come, quick!

330
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:52,389
Why are you scolding him?

331
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:55,166
Come, Rumi.

332
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,290
Didn't you see how he's befriended the guard?

333
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,160
Alright, don't be angry over it.

334
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,090
This isn't just anything, Danish.

335
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,400
Be stern with him.

336
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,530
I found it so weird.

337
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,106
Stop it, Mehwish.

338
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,490
He was the one who was with him that night.

339
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,936
We were both out of our senses.

340
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,380
By God, I didn't mean anything else.

341
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,910
I just said it,

342
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,666
But figured later that it isn't proper to say it like that.

343
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:56,560
Who knows how many years this will go on...

344
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,860
Just try to understand what I mean, Mehwish.

345
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,830
We'd -- forgotten Rumi that day.

346
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,360
Not me.

347
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,726
Alright, I'd forgotten.

348
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:09,710
The grief of your going had made me forget.

349
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,850
There!

350
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,300
You said it again.

351
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,196
Stop it, Mehwish.

352
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:15,726
It'll come up for a few days

353
00:26:15,726 --> 00:26:17,930
Now that it's happened.

354
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,250
Don't look at the words,

355
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,546
Look at my intentions when I say them.

356
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,419
So, what were your intentions?

357
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,828
You decided the moment I got back that I should not go to office.

358
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,996
What are your intentions?

359
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:32,250
You're not going to office, Mehwish.

360
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,120
No matter what happens.

361
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,943
You'd tether me here?
-Tether -- what?

362
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,851
We fell in love, got married,

363
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:42,322
We're the parents of a child.

364
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:44,562
These are relationships, Mehwish.

365
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,333
And relationships do tether us.

366
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,927
What'd I do when you're at the office and Rumi's at his school?

367
00:26:49,927 --> 00:26:53,900
This rotting flat suffocates me!

368
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,130
It's not a flat, Mehwish.

369
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,247
It's our home.

370
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,690
Whatever.

371
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,180
But I'm going to office from tomorrow, full stop.
-You're not going to office.

372
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,010
Please, don't even <i>think</i> about it.

373
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,734
Or else?

374
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,710
Would you beat me?

375
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,426
What are you saying?

376
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,127
Have I ever raised my hand on you?

377
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,577
Look at your eyes.

378
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:19,396
It looks like you'd eat me alive.

379
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:24,497
Looking at you, it looks like you'd slap me!
-No way, Mehwish, I'd never do that!

380
00:27:24,497 --> 00:27:27,290
You're picking a fight with yourself for no reason.

381
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,520
You think you've sinned because of a trifling mistake; it's not like that.

382
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,418
You're not a sinner,

383
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,189
And I have no complaints of you.

384
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,040
Alright, then.

385
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,400
Let me go to office.
-Didn't I say you're not going to office?

386
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,130
That --

387
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,380
Blighter, Shehwar Ahmed --

388
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,470
Is a wicked man --
-Don't insult anyone!

389
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,590
Don't look at anyone, Mehwish.

390
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,090
Look at me; I'm your husband.

391
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,250
I'm your other half.

392
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,610
As if I'm looking at anyone!

393
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,970
What are you saying?

394
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,976
What's up with you?

395
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,790
Honestly, Danish?

396
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,581
We can't live together anymore.

397
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,180
The same old anger.

398
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:21,204
We'll talk in the morning --
-I'll say the same in the morning - <i>we can't live together</i>.

399
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,001
Crazy lass, I can't live without you.

400
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:32,590
But <i>I</i> can.

401
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,070
And I <i>want to</i>.

402
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,195
I'm fed up of this relationship.

403
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,342
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

404
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:00,010
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

405
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,537
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

406
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,707
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

407
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:16,388
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

408
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:21,792
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

409
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,483
<i>What does it matter, if I don't have</i>

410
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:27,320
Honestly, Danish?
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

411
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,570
We can't live together anymore.
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

412
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,430
We can't live together anymore.
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

413
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:36,816
<i>That I had you;</i>

414
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,610
<i>But, from you, I have learnt</i>

415
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,350
<i>That, even in love,</i>

416
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,106
<i>One could rather betray,</i>

417
00:29:45,106 --> 00:29:46,330
<i>One could rather repulse.</i>

418
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,830
I'm fed up of this relationship.
<i>One could rather repulse.</i>

419
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,061
Mehwish.

420
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,341
He's fallen asleep.

421
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:34,102
Come.

422
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,116
C'mon, Mehwish.

423
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,836
Let's sleep in our room.

424
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,437
I'll sleep here.

425
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,147
You're mad, Mehwish.

426
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:17,469
Who knows what you're saying!

427
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:20,420
Do you know what you'd just said?

428
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,454
You'd said,

429
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:24,063
'I'm fed up of this relationship'.

430
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:28,155
Is that the kind of thing to say, even in anger?

431
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,470
Please,

432
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,960
Let's go and sleep; it's 2 a.m., and I have to go to office in the morning.

433
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,001
So do I.

434
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,046
Won't you let me go?

435
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:51,437
No, Mehwish.

436
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:54,330
That's the only thing I wouldn't agree to.

437
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,111
Go and sleep, then.

438
00:31:56,111 --> 00:32:00,640
I have nothing to do with that room, now.

439
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,190
Let's think about another option.

440
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,901
What other option?

441
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:09,284
You won't work at <i>his</i> office.

442
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:12,081
Work anywhere else.

443
00:32:12,081 --> 00:32:15,771
Does my handsome salary irk you?

444
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:18,860
Your stubbornness over working for him irks me.

445
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,917
The thing about going to Islamabad has hurt you.

446
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:25,490
Remember that I'd apologised for it the moment I'd come back.

447
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,205
Not the moment you'd come back.

448
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:31,290
I'd seen you at the airport with him.

449
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,549
You were very ashamed.

450
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:37,262
But I've forgotten that.

451
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:42,235
Now, I want to forget whatever I still remember.

452
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:44,605
Remember that we'd fallen in love,

453
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,776
Loved each other ardently,

454
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:51,701
We've shared our lives with each other and lived it together,

455
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:54,869
Never thinking that our wishes are much greater than my salary.

456
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:58,200
I never thought that.

457
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,460
Seeing that people had

458
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,506
Riches,

459
00:33:01,506 --> 00:33:04,530
Cars, mansions, businesses,

460
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,930
I'd say proudly

461
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,391
That I've got you.

462
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,340
And I don't need anything when you're with me.

463
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,557
There's a lot to life beyond you and me, Danish.

464
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:21,766
I hope you know that.

465
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,377
Beyond you and me --

466
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,401
There's Rumi, Mehwish.

467
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:28,997
Just look at him sleep peacefully.

468
00:33:28,997 --> 00:33:33,520
Perhaps children sleep with the belief that their parents are only theirs,

469
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,956
And that one of them will not have left them by the morning.

470
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,936
Please, come.

471
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,282
Good morning, Mr Matin!

472
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,364
Good morning.

473
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:45,353
'Morning.
-'Morning.

474
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,187
'Morning.

475
00:35:47,743 --> 00:35:50,925
How are you, Mr Danish?
-Fine.

476
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:53,561
Good morning, sir!

477
00:35:53,561 --> 00:35:54,641
Good morning.

478
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:56,101
Tea or coffee?

479
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:57,073
Coffee.

480
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,916
In a moment.

481
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,786
Is Rumi alright?

482
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,646
Fine.

483
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,860
Yes?

484
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,316
Mr Matin, this is Danish.

485
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,327
No --

486
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,246
Don't look at me.

487
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:35,160
I need a favour,

488
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,631
But I wouldn't be able to ask for it if you look at me.

489
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,306
Oh, well -- C'mon, mate...

490
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:44,196
What is it?

491
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:47,320
I need to borrow 80,000 urgently.

492
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,751
I'll return it in 3 months.

493
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:56,620
Sure, you'll get it.

494
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,491
Just

495
00:36:58,491 --> 00:37:02,681
Meet me in the canteen; I'll give you a cheque.

496
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,051
Thank you very much.

497
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:06,720
There's no thank yous

498
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,631
And sorrys in friendship, old chap.

499
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,881
I can't think of anything, Shehwar...

500
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:38,432
I don't feel like going home when I'm with you,

501
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,161
And --

502
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:43,582
My intentions begin to falter when I'm home.

503
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,251
He won't let me go to office.

504
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:47,214
He's firm about that.

505
00:37:47,214 --> 00:37:48,262
Then?

506
00:37:48,262 --> 00:37:50,182
What then?

507
00:37:50,182 --> 00:37:53,643
You'd have to decide.

508
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,090
Decide what?

509
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,470
Who'd you rather live with?

510
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,966
Me,

511
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:02,916
Or him?

512
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,396
Tell me,

513
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:13,460
Or I can disconnect while you sit back and think.

514
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,166
No, please don't.

515
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:20,666
Alright, tell me how much you trust me.

516
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,990
You shouldn't be asking this now.

517
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,430
Then, why do your intentions begin to falter?

518
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,790
Take the leash of 'marriage' off your neck

519
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,516
And shove it in his face.

520
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,076
What do you mean?

521
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:35,570
Ask him to divorce you.

522
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,010
Divorce?

523
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,701
Is there any problem?

524
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,514
He won't divorce me, Shehwar.

525
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:46,364
Leave that to me.

526
00:38:47,218 --> 00:38:48,925
What about Rumi?

527
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,235
What's with him?

528
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:51,930
Whatever does a kid want?

529
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,436
Things that he likes?

530
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:59,346
He'll get whatever he can lay his finger on.

531
00:38:59,346 --> 00:39:01,668
By the time he'd grow up,

532
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:06,450
He would've found out that there's something called 'divorce' too.

533
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,936
The times have changed.

534
00:39:08,936 --> 00:39:13,680
More than bonding with parents,

535
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,437
Kids look at what they're getting from them.

536
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:20,310
He's coming to return the 500,000 to you.

537
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,430
He may misbehave, too.

538
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,567
Just let him come.

539
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:31,970
If he misbehaves with me, the security guards will throw him out of the office.

540
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,148
Listen.

541
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,778
Yes?

542
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:38,939
Should I talk to him?

543
00:39:38,939 --> 00:39:41,990
What'd you talk about?

544
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,771
I'll ask him to strike a deal with me.

545
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,216
Take his money,

546
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,616
And set you free.

547
00:39:49,616 --> 00:39:53,227
Money for what?

548
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,737
You won't get it.

549
00:39:55,737 --> 00:40:01,018
A large sum of money crushes large sorrows under its weight.

550
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,940
Naturally, he'd feel the sorrow of leaving you.

551
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,456
So, let's buy that sorrow.

552
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:08,143
It'll lead to a fight, Shehwar.

553
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:12,567
Then, he won't think that your security guards might throw him out.

554
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:14,818
Just tell me this -

555
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,290
If he asked you,

556
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,547
'Do you want a divorce'?

557
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:20,809
You'd say,

558
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,176
'Yes'.

559
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:24,926
'I want a divorce'.

560
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:28,287
I'd said it last night, too.

561
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,858
But he didn't agree.

562
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:32,050
He started explaining to me like I'm a kid.

563
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,266
Well, then, we'll talk later.

564
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:37,177
And let him come to me.

565
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:39,330
Let's take a look at his price,

566
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:44,000
And see how much he sells for.

567
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
