1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,991
You're laughing?

2
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,666
I thought you'd be angry with me.

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,380
No way.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm delighted.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,650
I feel so good.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,660
You're taking so much interest in my life.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,850
Are you joking?

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,616
No way, mate.

9
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:31,630
I'm complimenting you.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,810
Go and call your Maman.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,440
Say, 'I've found a match for Papa, and I will not rest until I've gotten them married'.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,510
She'd be chuffed to hear that.

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,800
She'd give you a kiss.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,560
No, she won't be happy to hear that.

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,340
She'd cry, but say, 'That's great. Well done, Rumi'!

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,270
Then, go and tell her. Hear her compliments, too.

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,210
I already did.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,430
I've already told her.

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,236
I'd called her on the way.

20
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:59,048
She said, 'Go and ask Papa'.

21
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,186
Alright, I'll ask tomorrow. Have your dinner.

22
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:09,336
I'm starving.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,506
You're starving?

24
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:13,526
C'mon.

25
00:01:13,526 --> 00:01:15,367
Let's have dinner.

26
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,640
Maman had told me

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,530
That she thinks you like Miss Hania.

28
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,620
But you're so shy...

29
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,230
You can't bring yourself to say it.

30
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,500
What can't I say?

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,116
'I like you'.

32
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,646
So it's your Mum who's been feeding you these big words.

33
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:15,976
No, Papa.

34
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:18,396
These big words are all mine.

35
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,637
I'd told her about everything.

36
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:21,920
What did you tell her?

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,380
You'd gone to visit Teacher, right?

38
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,960
Sat there for a while, had tea...

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,973
You'd gone to say, 'Marry me'.

40
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,306
But you couldn't say it.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,576
Did Hania tell you this?

42
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,190
No.

43
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,506
Ms Watira did.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,540
I'm friends with her, too.

45
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,860
Why are you so shy?

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,520
Why don't you just say it?

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,750
Why do you stop eating in anger?

48
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,980
I haven't stopped eating.

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,606
I'm done.

50
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,358
Good night.

51
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,760
Wait, Papa...

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,716
Judging by the Teacher's smile, she'd agree.

53
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,686
You don't even say 'No', Papa...

54
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,610
Hania?

55
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,050
What's this?

56
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,961
What?

57
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,970
I'd heard you laughing when I came here, only to find out you're actually crying!

58
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,178
Ah --

59
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,196
I was laughing at the way he proposed to me on behalf of his father,

60
00:05:08,196 --> 00:05:11,317
And I'm beginning to tear up

61
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:14,907
At his helplessness, Watira.

62
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,026
What helplessness?

63
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:26,219
Back then, he was behaving like his Papa's Dad.

64
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:30,800
Like a father looking for life-saving drugs for his son

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
With no money in his pocket;

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,990
He was almost begging that someone save his father's life.

67
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,936
Then, save his life.

68
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,866
You'll get your due reward.

69
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:45,489
The Lord will save you in return.

70
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:49,460
I have no worry for my life.

71
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,290
That's what you think.

72
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,230
Otherwise, death stands just around the corner.

73
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,960
Remember, Hania -

74
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,460
It hurts far more to lose your love

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,188
Than to lose your life.

76
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,020
Bashir,

77
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,396
Is this Mehwish's bag?

78
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:29,019
Yes.

79
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:31,469
Is she going somewhere?

80
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:32,629
Yes.

81
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,700
Please, keep it in the car.

82
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,610
How much longer would I stay here?

83
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't like it

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,410
When you talk all day, before me,

85
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,140
To the one I want to talk to,

86
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,466
When he doesn't talk to me at all.

87
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,377
I'm leaving after breakfast.

88
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,010
Where are you going?

89
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,020
I have a place.

90
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,560
Besides that,

91
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,850
I can only go to my grave.

92
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,980
You'd live alone?

93
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,390
No.

94
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,220
He'd be with me.

95
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,790
I have countless memories of him.

96
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,540
I'd remember something about him every day

97
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,051
To while the day away.

98
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:18,000
That's my final punishment -

99
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
That I miss him every moment,

100
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,216
And he never miss me.

101
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,065
Please, Mehwish...

102
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,787
You didn't ask me

103
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,879
How I'd while away the nights

104
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,120
After spending my days talking about him.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,220
I've given him so much grief, Ayesha,

106
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,440
Hurt him so much

107
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,980
That the rest of the nights of my life

108
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,126
Will be spent shedding tears of repentance.

109
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,900
It's enough for this life for me to remember

110
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,120
That, deeply hurt, he used to say,

111
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,590
'I've got you',

112
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,130
And I knew all along that he was actually saying,

113
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,050
'I haven't even got you, Mehwish'...

114
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,836
Listen...

115
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,900
One's wife

116
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,390
Shouldn't really put a tie on him.

117
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,760
Why?

118
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,910
It's nothing, really...

119
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,270
If she remembered something

120
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,080
While tying its knot,

121
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,070
And got angry to remember it...

122
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,561
So?

123
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:13,826
It's not good for the husband.

124
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,388
You look very handsome.

125
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,106
Wait.

126
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,546
Your bag.

127
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,209
Go, now.

128
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,840
Aren't you coming?

129
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,600
No.

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,816
The staff goes first.

131
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,050
Didn't you always say,

132
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,620
'The Chairperson should always come an hour late'?

133
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,201
And, naturally, you used to go an hour late.

134
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,120
Bye.

135
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,603
Bye.

136
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,636
Go and sit there on the sofa.

137
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,956
Always up to his shenanigans!

138
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,733
Come here.

139
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,926
Yes?

140
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,186
How do I look?

141
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:22,976
Yes?

142
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,506
Look at me, will you?

143
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:27,356
Tell me.

144
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,262
Flirt with me.

145
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,456
What are you saying?

146
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:42,450
You're afraid today?

147
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,267
Crazy lad...

148
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:46,178
Danish ain't around anymore.

149
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:48,457
I'm all alone.

150
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:52,450
Take me out for coffee.

151
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,320
Just try and ask me out for once.

152
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm sorry, Mehwish.

153
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,536
I'm really sorry.

154
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:02,110
Alright, promise me, then.

155
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,040
Even if you have a row with your wife,

156
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,770
You'd never say to another woman,

157
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,419
'You look so beautiful'!

158
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,138
Never.

159
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,760
Well, the fault isn't entirely yours...

160
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,620
It's the fault of the likes of me, too.

161
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,810
A husband can't really say every day,

162
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,510
'You look so beautiful'!

163
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,660
'I haven't seen anyone like you'!

164
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,890
And the likes of me!

165
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,560
We'd believe it if someone else said it

166
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,386
That there's no one like us.

167
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,610
There are many of us.

168
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,650
Come with your wife sometime.

169
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,730
I'll tell her

170
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,690
That we're all very beautiful,

171
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,306
But not the most beautiful of them all.

172
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,800
What will I wear to her brother's wedding?

173
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,810
I mean, I've purchased all three artificial sets with her.

174
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,366
Her brother's getting married in such a haste th --

175
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,516
Alright,

176
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,266
What do I do?

177
00:13:37,266 --> 00:13:40,676
Selling the motorcycle won't get me enough either.

178
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,680
I don't have any friend except you.

179
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,890
I never thought I'd need any friend

180
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,666
When I've got you.

181
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
Tell me,

182
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,630
Have I ever gone to a friend?

183
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,586
I'm only friends with you.

184
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,486
You're very hungry?

185
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,580
Very.

186
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,156
Just...

187
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:41,947
It'll be ready in a while.

188
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,847
And Maman's here!

189
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,876
What's going on?

190
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,157
I'm making an omelette for Rumi.

191
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,857
Didn't he eat anything?

192
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,810
How could he? Nothing had been cooked.

193
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,081
Hey!

194
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:06,250
Didn't she cook food?

195
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,590
The maid left at 12.

196
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,110
She called,

197
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,376
Telling that her Mum's been rushed to the hospital.

198
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,946
Let's pause for a while, shall we?

199
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,086
Cheating, eh?

200
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,678
No, I'm very tired.

201
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,576
The thing is, I've got so many responsibilities...

202
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,356
Oh...

203
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:19,911
What time is it?

204
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:22,029
4.30.

205
00:16:22,308 --> 00:16:25,348
She hasn't called yet.

206
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:26,439
Who?

207
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,605
My teacher.

208
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:31,218
She'd said, 'I'll tell you tomorrow'.

209
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,284
Shall we continue?

210
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,606
Aren't you afraid?

211
00:16:35,606 --> 00:16:37,986
I mean, aren't you worried?

212
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,751
No.

213
00:16:39,751 --> 00:16:41,266
There's nothing to worry about.

214
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,326
I'm worried her smile may have been that kind of smile.

215
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,186
What kind?

216
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,860
Like, laughing it off.

217
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,136
Alright, Papa, let's continue.

218
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,566
Yes!

219
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,626
Did you see that? You lose!

220
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:19,390
You take the slightest thing to heart.

221
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,477
There was nothing like that in Teacher's smile.

222
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,980
C'mon, Papa, it's time for swimming.

223
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,160
Didn't I say you're not going to office?

224
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,920
That --

225
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
Blighter, Shehwar Ahmed --

226
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,010
Is a wicked man --
-Don't insult anyone!

227
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,090
Don't look at anyone, Mehwish.

228
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,996
Look at me; I'm your husband.

229
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,838
Honestly, Danish?

230
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,550
We can't live together anymore.

231
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,100
The same old anger.

232
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,680
We'll talk in the morning --
-I'll say the same in the morning - <i>we can't live together</i>.

233
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:36,950
Crazy lass, I can't live without you.

234
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,616
But <i>I</i> can.

235
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,570
And I <i>want to</i>.

236
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,176
I'm fed up of this relationship.

237
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,168
Good evening.

238
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:09,170
We thought we'd have dinner with you.

239
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,676
She's my wife,

240
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:11,686
Hello.

241
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,329
I'm Ifrah.

242
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,648
I suppose you'd know me?

243
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:18,959
Come in.

244
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,016
There isn't even a proper place to sit here.

245
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:30,456
We'd had chairs sent.

246
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,400
We forgot the table.

247
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:36,050
Please, sit.

248
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,886
I'll go get it.

249
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,466
You do know me, don't you?

250
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,937
Yes.

251
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,051
You would've heard my story, too?

252
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,020
No.

253
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,505
Look at me.

254
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:04,364
Take a good look at me and remember me.

255
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,490
Monty holds you in the highest regard.

256
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,966
He even told me about what he used to do.

257
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,570
He's ashamed of it.

258
00:20:24,496 --> 00:20:26,306
He even teared up

259
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,271
While talking today.

260
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,976
Careful.

261
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Right over here.

262
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,936
Right. Thank you, mate.

263
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,360
My things would be here by tomorrow.

264
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,470
My things would be here by tomorrow.
-The same old?

265
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,070
Nothing of the same.

266
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,286
Even you're not the same anymore.

267
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:52,046
You've become so good like me.

268
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,750
Do you know when we become so good?

269
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,410
When we've tried being bad.

270
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,790
But then, people don't believe that we've become good now.

271
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,340
Well,

272
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,020
You were just 'bad',

273
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,406
Not a two-timer.

274
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,090
Infidelity is like becoming piebald, Monty,

275
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,246
Even if your condition gets cured, its scars remain.

276
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,930
I'll get you some water.

277
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,210
Hello?

278
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,777
It's Rumi, teacher.

279
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,186
I know.

280
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:20,970
You'd said, 'I'd tell tomorrow'.

281
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,610
Sure, I will, but first, tell me what the gentleman says.

282
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,860
Gentleman?

283
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,566
Yes.

284
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,580
Oh, you're talking about Papa!

285
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,666
Yeah.

286
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,396
I'll ask him later.

287
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:34,710
Why, mate?

288
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,560
Why'd you ask him later?

289
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,640
You'd have me insulted?

290
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,260
How would you be insulted?

291
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,500
Splendid.

292
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,836
What if I said 'yes', and the gentleman refused, saying, 'I don't want to marry Hania'?

293
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:50,616
It'd be so insulting then, right?

294
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,336
He won't say that.

295
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:53,760
Believe me.

296
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,686
In fact, he'd even kiss my face.

297
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,707
Are you there?

298
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,458
Yeah.

299
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,680
So, tell me, would you?

300
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,207
You're saying 'Yes', right?

301
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,410
Give me an hour.

302
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,371
Another hour?

303
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:18,170
One doesn't hurry in these matters, Rumi.

304
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,151
Look at the gentleman. It seems you're already very late.

305
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,910
Alright, I'll talk later. The gentleman's coming.

306
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,956
Hey!

307
00:23:46,396 --> 00:23:49,496
You're doing the dishes at my place?

308
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:52,450
We're doing <i>our</i> dishes at <i>your</i> place.

309
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,110
Just think we're getting no water in our flat.

310
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,017
Besides,

311
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,298
I'm like your brother.

312
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,337
Just think that I <i>am</i> your brother.

313
00:24:01,337 --> 00:24:04,571
Brothers do so much for their sisters.

314
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:06,367
What else can you do?

315
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,287
Awaiting orders!

316
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:10,317
You won't be able to do it.

317
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,757
I'll get it done even if I couldn't do it.

318
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:14,147
I promise.

319
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,970
Would you go to <i>him</i>?

320
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,960
Would you beg him

321
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,956
To come and meet me once?

322
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:33,980
To visit this flat

323
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,360
Just for once?

324
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,950
It'd rid this barren wasteland of the stench of infidelity.

325
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,910
Would you do me this favour, Monty?

326
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,850
Mind if I ask something?

327
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,360
Would you go to him?

328
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,810
Don't just ask him to come and meet her.

329
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,670
Ask him

330
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,230
Why it is that she can't be forgiven.

331
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,200
Granted

332
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,060
That she'd made a mistake,

333
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,030
She'd sinned...

334
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,876
She's admitted it, too.

335
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,846
She's performed every penance and more.

336
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,360
So, ask him,

337
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,916
'Even the Lord would grant absolution',

338
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:55,686
'So why don't you'?

339
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,386
There are countless examples, Monty,

340
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:04,010
Of people marrying the one they divorced again.

341
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,857
Why can't he just...

342
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,016
There are divorces in marriages,

343
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:12,456
But not in love.

344
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:16,266
Seeking another man is plain infidelity,

345
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:18,840
And if he forgave her infidelity,

346
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,496
Wouldn't he become no less than the Lord Himself?

347
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,546
Such godhood

348
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,227
Is what he fears.

349
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,740
She's coming here? But why? Papa doesn't even know!

350
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,730
So?

351
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,160
It doesn't look good

352
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,886
That the lady comes all decked up and the gentleman's running.

353
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,270
Isn't she there yet?

354
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,486
Is she almost here?

355
00:26:57,486 --> 00:26:59,446
Oh my God...

356
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:04,009
Alright, please disconnect quickly. I'll ask Papa to get ready.

357
00:27:04,009 --> 00:27:05,979
Hold on, Ms Watira...

358
00:27:05,979 --> 00:27:07,280
Yes?

359
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,510
How's her mood?

360
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,446
Very good.

361
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,976
As in, she was very pleased.

362
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,690
There! So she'd say 'Yes', wouldn't she?

363
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,916
Not sure...

364
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,366
She can say anything when she's laughing.

365
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:21,778
Oh! She's here. Bye.

366
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,896
Oh, it's you, Teacher!

367
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,834
What a pleasant surprise!

368
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:48,550
You're quite the actor!

369
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,118
Actor?

370
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,860
I know.

371
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,677
It's no surprise. You knew I was coming.

372
00:27:55,677 --> 00:28:00,466
I knew it. But I didn't believe that you're <i>actually</i> coming.

373
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,430
How are the preparations?

374
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,981
Preparations?

375
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:06,900
Yes -- I mean...

376
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,056
How are the gentleman's preparations?

377
00:28:09,056 --> 00:28:11,056
I've just told him.

378
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,896
He ran into his room the moment he heard it.

379
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:15,626
Ran into his room?

380
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,860
He was running on the treadmill.

381
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,056
He was sweating.

382
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,640
What's it with you?

383
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,596
Hello?

384
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,310
Hi.

385
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,607
It's Hania.

386
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:44,930
Hi.

387
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,577
Please come downstairs.

388
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,729
We've got to meet.

389
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,076
Coming.

390
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,450
Listen...

391
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,881
Yes?

392
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,130
Rumi won't be there when we meet.

393
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,586
Promise?

394
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,700
He won't be there.

395
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,400
I promise.

396
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:04,308
Okay.

397
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,970
Is your Papa happy?

398
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,510
I didn't see.

399
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,876
I was not there.

400
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:29,530
Alright,

401
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,280
Don't be disheartened.

402
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,386
I should be saying that, right?

403
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,780
Please don't be disheartened, okay?

404
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,356
It happens.

405
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:43,722
What's she wearing?

406
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,386
She looks good, doesn't she?

407
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:48,376
It looks like she's here for her wedding!

408
00:29:48,376 --> 00:29:51,877
I swear, she looks right batty!

409
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,667
Maman?

410
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,799
Maman...?

411
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:17,790
Dad used to say,

412
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,427
'If you want to see your Dad's childhood, look at your first son'.

413
00:30:22,427 --> 00:30:24,720
'He's just like your father'.

414
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,240
My Dad used to say the same.

415
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,290
In fact, when Rumi was born,

416
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,660
He said,

417
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,880
'Don't think of him as Rumi'.

418
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,936
'This little rascal's Akhtar Ahmed'.

419
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:39,210
'Even if I die, now, never think that I'm gone',

420
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,236
'For you will find me in him'.

421
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:47,140
And, honestly? I've never felt

422
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,066
That Dad's no more.

423
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,610
So,

424
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,180
Your 'Dad' had proposed your marriage to me,

425
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,866
And he wanted me to say 'Yes'.

426
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,907
No way.

427
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,000
He --

428
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,100
The bugger!

429
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,850
Bad word for Dad!

430
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,800
In that moment, he was just... <i>Dad</i>.

431
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,520
I looked into deeply into his eyes,

432
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,409
Felt his love as he asked for my hand in matrimony;

433
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:30,600
Felt, also, that he was as self-seeking as a father would be for his son,

434
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,036
Which is why I just couldn't refuse.

435
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,440
So, I accept the proposal.

436
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,750
I've even brought an engagement ring.

437
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,210
Please,

438
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,620
Put it on if you accept.

439
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,987
Please call me when you've put it on.

440
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,506
Otherwise, I'll take it

441
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,747
That you didn't listen to your Dad.

442
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,166
What's this?

443
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,836
Your tiffin, sir.

444
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,126
But why?

445
00:34:07,126 --> 00:34:08,226
Who gave it to you?

446
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:09,956
I did.

447
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,820
Remember how you used to carry a tiffin?

448
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,421
With two <i>shami kebabs</i>,

449
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,470
Cucumber and tomato salad,

450
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,707
Two <i>rotis</i>, leftover curry, and sometimes a little <i>gulab jamun</i>, too...

451
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:25,486
You may go.

452
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,630
I thought I shouldn't have to remind you of the category you fall into now,

453
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,000
Of where you've fallen down from the chairman's position.

454
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,669
Stop it.

455
00:34:41,026 --> 00:34:42,916
I'm your husband, Maham.

456
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,370
Yes.

457
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,196
You are.

458
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:50,366
Be a husband at home all you want,

459
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:53,620
But you'd have to work at the office,

460
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,060
And, my dear husband,

461
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,110
You know just how important this job is for you.

462
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,757
Yes, I know.

463
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:10,086
Bye.

464
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,956
Wait.

465
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,940
A car's here to pick you up.

466
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,076
Messrs Hassan and Shamshad are waiting.

467
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:28,136
Have a nice chat with them on the way.

468
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,990
Your tiffin.

469
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,216
Bye, sweetheart!

470
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:45,256
Have a good day!

471
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,190
I felt she was right.

472
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,450
You'd be calling us,

473
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,990
But never calling upon us;

474
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,760
We'd talk about you,

475
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,350
But you'd never be there.

476
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,076
She'd be envious, wouldn't she?

477
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,020
It was Dad's flat...

478
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,170
She shouldn't have gone there.

479
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:37,420
<i>You</i> could've bought it.

480
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,950
You could buy the entire building.

481
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,391
I didn't want to buy it.

482
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,620
I wanted that someone <i>else</i> buy it and live there.

483
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,610
You're exacting your revenge?

484
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,426
By the Lord, I'm not.

485
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:56,540
I'm writing a story with the searing ink of my blood.

486
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,670
I'm writing, 'The choice to two-time was her right',

487
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,060
'And, having used her right in choosing that',

488
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,736
'She's lost every right she had over me'.

489
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,629
Yes?

490
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,400
What's his name?

491
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,876
Monty?

492
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,110
Okay.

493
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:49,986
Here's a glass of water.

494
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:57,470
Read this 7 times,

495
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,950
And when you have,

496
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,320
Blow over the glass 3 times,

497
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,436
And drink the water.

498
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,240
Hopefully, if the Lord wills so,

499
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,701
He'll be here.

500
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
