1
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,880
Who's with Mr Matin?

2
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,981
Yes?

3
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,580
I'm sorry,

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,880
We tried our best,

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,110
But he didn't make it.

6
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,690
As it pleases the Lord...

7
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,716
Please, be brave.

8
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,847
Her husband called the day before she died,

9
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:58,520
And said, 'Samina wants to talk'.

10
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,990
I talked to her.

11
00:03:02,571 --> 00:03:06,231
She was gasping for breath.

12
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:12,060
She asked me,

13
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:21,390
'Does one ever get punished for disloyalty'?

14
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,430
I said, 'Yes'.

15
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,957
She asked, 'How much'?

16
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,190
I said,

17
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,526
'Those who are loyal'

18
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:45,260
'Wouldn't even get so great a reward'...

19
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,980
She said,

20
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,490
'Alright, Matin Ahmed',

21
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,420
'I forgive you'.

22
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,636
If you're still awake, why aren't you answering your phone?

23
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:16,927
Phone?

24
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:17,926
Did you call?

25
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:18,916
Yes.

26
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:19,916
No?

27
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,456
It didn't ring.

28
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:23,607
Anyway, please, come.

29
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,986
Here.

30
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,816
The battery's dead...

31
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,410
But it was ringing just now.

32
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,146
You must've been somewhere else.

33
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:42,037
The thing is, a very close friend of mine passed away so suddenly...

34
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,790
I'm very upset.

35
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:48,176
Please, sit.

36
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,016
Thank you.

37
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm sorry but I can't offer you tea.

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,477
That will not be necessary, thank you.

39
00:04:56,477 --> 00:05:00,367
Tell me, should they come to pay you the advance tomorrow?

40
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,178
Yes.

41
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,288
But it'd be better if

42
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,759
We made it the day after tomorrow.

43
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,359
He was a very dear friend of mine.

44
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm missing him...

45
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,012
No problem; it's alright.

46
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,999
We'll make it the day after tomorrow. Please, get some rest.

47
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,369
Alright?

48
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,930
We'll meet the day after tomorrow.

49
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,711
And yes,

50
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:25,960
Once they

51
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,301
Make the full payment...

52
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,072
You do realise, right?

53
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,271
What?

54
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,240
You'd have to give them the keys and leave.

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,656
Yes. I know. I'd leave.

56
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,850
I can arrange something for you if you want.

57
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,150
I'll let you know the day after tomorrow.

58
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,330
I want to rest for now, Mr Jameel.

59
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,590
I'm very tired.

60
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,286
Sure, get some rest. We'll meet again the day after tomorrow.

61
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:49,170
Goodbye.

62
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,701
Okay.

63
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,510
May I bring Rumi over for a few days?

64
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,196
It's been a few months now

65
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,166
And I haven't even seen his face.

66
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,340
As if he'd come here!

67
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,956
His father would've made him your enemy over all these months!

68
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,120
He's not the type.

69
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,536
What?

70
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,657
I mean, he won't poison his ears.

71
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:35,506
I know him.

72
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,356
So, may I bring him over?

73
00:06:41,356 --> 00:06:44,446
You don't mind, do you?

74
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,526
Why would I mind, mate?

75
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,576
He can come and live with you.

76
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,027
I'd be happy.

77
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:52,930
Just... He'd better not stare at <i>me</i> every moment.

78
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,986
Why would he?

79
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:55,340
They do.

80
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,036
Stepsons stare at stepfathers a lot.

81
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,150
He won't.

82
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,286
I promise.

83
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,069
Alright, I have no problem.

84
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,099
You can bring him over today.

85
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,320
Then, just call him.

86
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,729
Ask him to drop him here.

87
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,410
Call who?

88
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,141
Danish.

89
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,492
That's his name, right?

90
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,102
Goodness...

91
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:23,982
As if I'd call such plebs

92
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:27,013
For such trifles!

93
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,892
You have his number, don't you?

94
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,830
Yes.

95
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,746
Then, just call him.

96
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:35,818
Tell him, 'I'm sending a car; send Rumi with the driver'.

97
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:39,047
You can go too if you like.

98
00:07:39,047 --> 00:07:40,878
Thank you so much!

99
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,839
Now, would you thank me for that?

100
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,820
You rule over my heart.

101
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,330
Reign like an Empress.

102
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,701
Don't ask for permission like the subjects.

103
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,182
Okay, I'm going to the office.

104
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,396
Here.

105
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,450
And why don't you ask me to come to office?

106
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,406
Would you rather come even now?

107
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,706
Alright.

108
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,216
Come to office

109
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:16,766
Once Rumi's left.

110
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:17,657
And yes,

111
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,080
Don't ask.

112
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,416
It's your office.

113
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,407
Mr Diwan!

114
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:25,627
Mr Diwan!

115
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,867
Just a minute, Diwan.

116
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,728
Give that to me.

117
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:33,129
It's no longer your responsibility.

118
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,516
There.

119
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,960
Hello?

120
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,506
Who is it?

121
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,641
Who are you?

122
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,698
This is Danish's number, innit?

123
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,934
No...

124
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:34,647
This is my father, Mr Matin's number.

125
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,588
How's it possible?

126
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:39,498
This is Danish's number.

127
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:42,050
Honestly - who are you?

128
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,116
Shut up!

129
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,817
Who are <i>you</i>?

130
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,979
Whoever you may be,

131
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:11,750
Give the phone to Danish.

132
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,910
Or tell him that I want to meet Rumi.

133
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,220
Rumi?

134
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,430
Look,

135
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,436
I told you, this is not Mr Danish's number.

136
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:24,966
Please don't call me again and again to disturb me.

137
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,170
How many times do I have to tell you that this isn't Mr Danish's number? It's my father, Mr Matin's number. Why can't you just understand?

138
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,656
It's you, Madame!

139
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,257
'Madame'?

140
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:56,980
Who?

141
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,966
I'm the dealer, Madame. Khwaja Jameel.

142
00:10:58,966 --> 00:11:00,850
I'm selling your flat, remember?

143
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,970
I'd called because I wanted to talk to Mr Danish.

144
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,947
Is he sleeping?

145
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:09,080
Do <i>you</i> think this is Mr Danish's number, too?

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,786
So it isn't his number?

147
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:11,650
Not at all.

148
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,590
Sorry -- Sorry, Ma'am...

149
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,536
6 p.m.?

150
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,650
Mr Danish?

151
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,356
Who's this Mr Danish?

152
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,290
Hello?

153
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:10,021
Hello...

154
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,051
Right...

155
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:15,221
A Mr Danish had called me from this number.

156
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:17,050
I, too, got a call

157
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,480
From a Mr Matin from your number.

158
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,466
Mr Matin?

159
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,286
It's Hania, Mr Danish.

160
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:26,586
Oh...

161
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:29,400
I think the two of you have identical cell phones.

162
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,401
Yes.

163
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,500
They're identical.

164
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:37,010
It seems you've accidentally given me your phone,

165
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,940
And kept Dad's phone with you.

166
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,550
Oh...

167
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,597
Alright, I'll come and give it to you in a while.

168
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:45,766
Okay.

169
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,602
Thank you.

170
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,570
Hey...

171
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,330
Danish is not answering his phone.

172
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,140
A woman's answering.

173
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,960
So?

174
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,310
Just go, mate. How many times have I told you not to ask?

175
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,978
Okay.

176
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,720
I hear you're selling the flat, sir?

177
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,910
Yes.

178
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,560
Why, sir?

179
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,418
I had to, mate.

180
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,500
Don't you have the keys?

181
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,060
I don't live here anymore.

182
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,220
I know.

183
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,167
The good sir had told me that you were posted in another city,

184
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:24,530
And wee Rumi had gone with you.

185
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,650
Rumi?

186
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,550
W -- Where'd he gone?

187
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,141
With you?

188
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,036
Where's Danish?

189
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:35,567
He just left on his bike.

190
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,710
When would he be back?

191
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,640
No idea. Sometimes, he's back quickly, but sometimes, he gets very late.

192
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,349
I'll be waiting in the car.

193
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,650
He's not at home.

194
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,610
Where are you?

195
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,670
I'm in the car, waiting for him.

196
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,260
Why are you waiting?

197
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,570
Just meet Rumi.

198
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,870
Or just bring him along and come.

199
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,660
He's sent Rumi somewhere.

200
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,530
Sent Rumi somewhere?

201
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,400
He's told everyone here that I've been posted in another city

202
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,120
And I've taken Rumi along.

203
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,290
He would've felt embarrassed to say his wife's left him...

204
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,860
The same old

205
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,170
'Honour' problem...

206
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,660
Well, no problem...

207
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,360
There is a problem, Shehwar.

208
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,980
Where's he sent Rumi?

209
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,780
Where would he send him?

210
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,737
What's the worst that a bitterly defeated pleb and a wounded husband can do?

211
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,790
He'll try to leverage his son to hurt you,

212
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,330
Or, more accurately,

213
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,916
Blackmail you.

214
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:36,280
What else can he do?

215
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,301
But don't worry.

216
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:40,860
If Rumi didn't meet you within two days,

217
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,876
He'll get a notice from your lawyer on the third day.

218
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:45,986
You'll see,

219
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:49,996
I'll blow the bugger to bits.

220
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:52,137
Come back.

221
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:54,556
Don't wait for him.

222
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:56,270
No, Shehwar -- please.

223
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,020
Just wait a while.

224
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,560
I'll come back right after meeting him.

225
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,496
I'll come back right after meeting him.
-Goodness...

226
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:04,870
You're ruining such a fantastic evening.

227
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,740
Do you know,

228
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,061
I was enjoying thoroughly

229
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:12,270
Before you called?

230
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,870
At the slightest rustle,

231
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,940
I felt that you're back.

232
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,716
But now

233
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:26,960
My eager glances at every rustle would be wasted.

234
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,941
Okay, fine.

235
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,502
Wait for him...

236
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,430
Your phone.

237
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,660
Thank you.

238
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,507
Here's Mr Matin's.

239
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,507
Thank you.

240
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:18,728
Sugar?

241
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:22,098
No, thank you, I won't have tea.

242
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,097
How could I?

243
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:28,267
It's...

244
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:31,267
Just been three days...

245
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:35,377
I miss him so much...

246
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,990
I miss him a lot, too.

247
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,230
I was reading his diary today.

248
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,946
There wasn't a single one of its last ten pages that didn't mention you.

249
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:58,316
He'd even mentioned having tea with you at the bistro.

250
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,356
One teaspoon.

251
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,900
When you came to the school the other day,

252
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,100
You didn't mention that you

253
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,140
Were Dad's colleague?

254
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,810
I couldn't even imagine you were his daughter.

255
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,670
I'm sorry about that day.

256
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,260
Why?

257
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,740
That's what a good teacher should have done.

258
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,947
No compromise.

259
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,576
It's good.

260
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Mehwish is your wife, right?

261
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,556
<i>Was</i>...

262
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:43,690
Yeah, about that...

263
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,720
She called today. I happened to answer.

264
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,390
Heaven knows what she thought about it.

265
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,060
I'm sorry,

266
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,591
But she's rather insolent.

267
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,430
Why

268
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,416
Are you selling the flat?

269
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,330
Don't be surprised.

270
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,186
Your dealer called in the morning. He told me about that.

271
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,340
And I'm asking you because

272
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,590
Dad was greatly worried about you.

273
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,170
He'd written in his diary, 'I'm worried about my friend'...

274
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,080
'He's in a fit of rage',

275
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,206
'And in his state',

276
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:30,767
'One is strong, but never sensible'.

277
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,840
Has Rumi improved?

278
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,510
Yes.

279
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,610
You were right that if he promised it, he'd get good results.

280
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,960
He's doing well.

281
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,930
In fact,

282
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,580
He now talks, laughs, and plays pranks and all...

283
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,200
Oh, <i>those</i> monkey tricks!

284
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,570
When I gave him a star on his hand the other day,

285
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,170
He said, 'Will you marry me'?

286
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,040
<i>What</i>?

287
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm honest!

288
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,430
I said, 'You're too young, lad',

289
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:03,027
And he said, 'Just wait a while; I'll be old enough in time'.

290
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:07,886
Then, get married.

291
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,376
It'd delight my son.

292
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,830
I'll meet your wife someday.

293
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,520
I'd like to see

294
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,930
If one who could cheat her own son for her own self

295
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,876
Could look just like any other woman.

296
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:38,177
I'll take my leave.

297
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,821
As you please.

298
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,996
Bye.

299
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:49,576
Bye.

300
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,213
Listen...

301
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,870
Don't worry about Rumi's studies.

302
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,740
He's my responsibility now.

303
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,350
I'll make sure he improves,

304
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,716
Even if I have to marry him.

305
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:12,766
Bye.

306
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:14,456
Bye.

307
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,730
Good evening!

308
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,170
Evenin'!
-How are you?

309
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,420
Fine, thank the Lord!
-Who's in this car?

310
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,750
A guest.

311
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,520
For?

312
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,840
Mr Danish.

313
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,171
Oh, Mr Danish's guest --
-Wait, Monty.

314
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:36,080
Yes?

315
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,376
It's a lady.

316
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,998
Oh...

317
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,339
Good ol' Danish's here.

318
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,350
How are you, Danish?

319
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,560
Someone's come to meet you.

320
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,200
Over there in that car.

321
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,481
It's a lady.

322
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,586
It's Madame!

323
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,156
Where's Rumi?

324
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:14,546
Why are you here?

325
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,940
I had to come here because you didn't answer your phone.

326
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,470
I didn't have the phone with me.

327
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,520
I know.

328
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,026
It was with a girlfriend of yours.

329
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:26,070
Come upstairs. Then, we'll talk.

330
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,710
I'm not coming upstairs.

331
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,220
You'd have to, now that you're here.

332
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,916
Otherwise, there'd be a scene for everyone to watch right here.

333
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,806
Good evening, Madame.

334
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:56,060
Nobody here knows that you've left forever,

335
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,666
Or that we've been divorced.

336
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,640
And look at yourself, waltzing right in,

337
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Almost as if to tell everyone that you're nobody to those who live in this flat.

338
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,680
Who am I to you?

339
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,720
Believe it now, it's all over.

340
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,700
Why do you want to hide it?

341
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,050
I won't hide it for long,

342
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,980
But if anyone here found out, I'd be embarrassed greatly.

343
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,930
That's how I feel.

344
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,430
Where's Rumi?

345
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,877
In boarding school.

346
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,138
<i>What</i>?

347
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:29,467
You got him into boarding school?

348
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,610
You got him into boarding school?
-Yes, he felt he's better off in a boarding school.

349
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,140
I agreed when he said so.

350
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,840
I want to meet him.

351
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,440
Why, sure.

352
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,190
He must be missing you, too.

353
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,820
I'd take him along on Saturdays and Sundays.

354
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,760
Where?

355
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,650
To my home.

356
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,810
No. He's not going there.

357
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,210
Why?

358
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,950
I won't let him.

359
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,150
You're his mother. Meet him whenever you want.

360
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,110
But I wouldn't like it one bit if he met <i>that</i> sort of people because of you.

361
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,076
'<i>That</i> sort of people'?

362
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,430
As in, Shehwar?

363
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,140
You're just creating a problem for no reason.

364
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,720
I thought I'd never see you now that you've left.

365
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,890
That's why I sent Rumi off to a boarding school

366
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,040
So that you can meet him whenever you like.

367
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,990
I meet him there, too.

368
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,150
Rumi's hostel is very good.

369
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,430
It's large,

370
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,410
And there's no problem

371
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:26,076
About calling, meeting, or even playing with him.

372
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:28,016
I play with him for hours.

373
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,980
He'd be with me on Saturdays and Sundays.

374
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,520
Didn't I just say?

375
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,390
He won't!

376
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,940
Never.

377
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,200
Besides, nothing like this was decided at the time of the divorce.

378
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,780
Remember, then,

379
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,820
You're the one creating problems.

380
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,340
I'm going to court on Monday if he didn't come tomorrow.

381
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,290
Court?

382
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,810
Are you out of your mind?

383
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,530
Remember, Mehwish,

384
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,239
Have I never done anything good for you in these 8 years?

385
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,520
It'd be better if you decided right away.

386
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,476
From now on, neither will I wait in the parking in front of your flat,

387
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:04,950
Nor hear your girlfriend's voice over the phone.

388
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,000
She's not my girlfriend...

389
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,410
She's Mr Matin's daughter.

390
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,870
Mr Matin passed away,

391
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,640
And we switched phones at the hospital by mistake.

392
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,770
Our phones are identical.

393
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,796
Whatever.

394
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,580
Aren't you sad at Mr Matin's death?

395
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,861
May the Lord give him Paradise.

396
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,826
Sit.

397
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,810
Danish, I don't want to go to court,

398
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,450
Nor make the headlines with this story,

399
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,630
So, it'd be better if you just agreed that he'd be with me on Saturdays and Sundays.

400
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,010
Never.

401
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,160
You'll regret it.

402
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,790
You'd spend every penny of your salary paying your lawyers.

403
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,500
Please, Mehwish...

404
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,000
He's mentally unstable.

405
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,150
He'd be furious if he saw you with Shehwar.

406
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:01,302
His progress report just a month ago was so bad that I was worried he may not be able to continue in the school.

407
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,596
He's just begun to get better.

408
00:29:03,596 --> 00:29:07,322
Started enjoying things, having fun, playing tricks...

409
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:08,590
Please...

410
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,320
Please, do go and meet him,

411
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,430
But don't be adamant about taking him along.

412
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,570
If that's your reply, remember,

413
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,510
We're meeting in a few days in court.

414
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,746
A bitter defeat awaits you there, Danish.

415
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,817
Please, show yourself out...

416
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:28,146
Please show yourself out!

417
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:30,329
Out!

418
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,026
Y --

419
00:29:56,026 --> 00:29:58,440
You're leaving already?

420
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,182
Where have you been posted?

421
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,706
Get moving.

422
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,766
Shehwar Ahmed, as in,

423
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:19,986
The Shehwar Ahmed of Shehwar Chemicals?

424
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,737
Yes.

425
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:25,216
So she's marrying him.

426
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,077
Yes.

427
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:30,488
What do you do, Mr Danish?

428
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,820
I'm an officer of the Government.

429
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,907
17th grade.

430
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:35,280
How much do you earn?

431
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,340
About 65,000.

432
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,220
How old is your son?

433
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,710
6 years.

434
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,920
Right...

435
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,716
So you don't want that he should be with her at her place.

436
00:30:46,716 --> 00:30:48,590
He won't live there.

437
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,266
Speak for yourself, Mr Danish.

438
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,456
I don't want it either.

439
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:54,216
The thing is, my son

440
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:55,600
Is very intelligent

441
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,839
And sensitive.

442
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,580
He'd be upset if he saw his mother with another man.

443
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,210
Such things affect his studies.

444
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,996
So,

445
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:07,866
Look for a middle path.

446
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,800
No, she's adamant that he'd be with her at her place on Saturdays and Sundays.

447
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,860
Then, just let him.

448
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,970
I can say from my experience

449
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,040
That it'll only be a matter of 2 or 3 Sundays.

450
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,440
He'd never tolerate his lover's son

451
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,950
Spending Saturday and Sunday nights clinging to his mother.

452
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,010
Why are you saying such things?

453
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,720
I won't let it come to that.

454
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,400
I'd fight him in court.

455
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Mr Danish,

456
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,390
You'd lose if you chose to fight.

457
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,440
He'd hire the top lawyers,

458
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,206
And level accusations so low and base on you

459
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:47,667
That you'd be ashamed to be yourself.

460
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:51,540
Your son, being sensitive, won't be able to listen to any of it either.

461
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,320
And if you don't earn anything above your salary,

462
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,156
You'd be spending every penny of it paying your lawyers and on the court proceedings.

463
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:03,010
Don't look at the court.

464
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,178
Look at who you're up against.

465
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:07,860
And honestly?

466
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,246
A bitter defeat awaits you.

467
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,176
Here.

468
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,950
What am I looking at, Mr Rehmati?

469
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,010
Shehwar Chemicals' share

470
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,500
Has fallen by 2.25 Rupees

471
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,241
Even when the market's risen by 95 points yesterday?

472
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,001
If the banking sector's doing well, do you want me to start a bank?

473
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:59,751
I want to know the reason.

474
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,141
We're working on the report. So what if it's late by 3 weeks?

475
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:06,452
The company's goodwill matters, too, doesn't it?

476
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:07,970
No.

477
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,257
I want to know the actual reason.

478
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:13,509
Alright.

479
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:16,270
Meet me at 12 today.

480
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,701
What?

481
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,010
Why aren't you having your breakfast?

482
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,830
The same Saturday-Sunday thing?

483
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,950
Jeez, mate, get a grip on yourself.

484
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,426
Should I care about the business,

485
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:40,650
Or waste all my time with you at the court, just to fix that wretch?

486
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,200
You've threatened him, right?

487
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,663
That should be enough.

488
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,000
Didn't I tell you last night

489
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,256
That he'd cling to you every moment if he stayed here on Saturdays and Sundays.

490
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,450
What about me?

491
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,600
I don't have anything except Saturdays and Sundays.

492
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,540
And would you look at the state of the company!

493
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,030
I left home for two and a half months,

494
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:08,376
Only to find out today that the company's share has fallen by 2.25 Rupees.

495
00:34:08,376 --> 00:34:09,290
As in,

496
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,406
I've fallen in the eyes of the stock dealer.

497
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,510
Alright, fix your mood.

498
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,910
You can call him here once he's grown up.

499
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:23,751
I'll give him a bedroom of his own.

500
00:34:24,211 --> 00:34:25,420
But

501
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,000
He'd just be a bother for now.

502
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,090
He'll keep calling 'Maman' all the time,

503
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,610
And I'd be left looking at him.

504
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,130
As in, I'd lose both ways.

505
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm adamant about it, Shehwar.

506
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,730
When he heard the threat, he said,

507
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,630
'Get out'!

508
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,640
He's so cheap...

509
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,686
Mr Diwan!

510
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,726
Here.

511
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,070
It's good if he's gone to a boarding school.

512
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,880
Go and meet him.

513
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,076
Take him in the car,

514
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:57,666
Take him on a drive, go shopping,

515
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,627
That's enough.

516
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,911
I'd like it

517
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:05,030
If you remained a lover.

518
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,010
If you act like a mother,

519
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,836
I'd feel you've aged 50 years over one night.

520
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,466
Alright, send her in. Thank you.

521
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:33,327
Alright, I'll come back later.
-No, please, keep sitting. I'd need your help.

522
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,377
Good morning, Ma'am.

523
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:41,986
Good morning. Please, come in. Come and sit down.

524
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,390
Miss Mehwish...

525
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,740
Please, sit.

526
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,056
This is Miss Hania,

527
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,390
In-charge of Rumi's class.

528
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,716
Hi.

529
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,340
Hi.

530
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,140
I suppose we've met before?

531
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,546
No.

532
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:02,266
We've talked over the phone before.

533
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,367
So, you've come to meet Rumi?

534
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,960
No, I've come to take him along.

535
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll take him with me when school's over at 1.30.

536
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,356
I'd leave him here before the evening.
-Of course.

537
00:37:15,356 --> 00:37:16,880
Would you like some tea?

538
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,060
No, thank you.

539
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,420
Okay.

540
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,670
Have you got a permission letter

541
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,000
From his father?

542
00:37:25,146 --> 00:37:27,666
Permission letter?

543
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,090
I'm his mother, Ma'am.

544
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,740
Of course, you may be,

545
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,120
But how'd I know that?

546
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,036
I'm meeting you for the first time.

547
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,700
Please call Rumi; he'd tell you.

548
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,730
If Rumi said you're his mother, I could allow you to <i>meet</i> him,

549
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,516
But I can't <i>send</i> him with you.

550
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,510
If he told you I'm his mother,

551
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,980
Why can't he come with me?

552
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,340
Look...

553
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,780
If you don't have a permission letter,

554
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,440
I can't send Rumi with you.

555
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,336
I'm sorry, but these are the rules. We have to follow them.

556
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,010
I'm surprised.

557
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,286
I'm sorry.

558
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:22,710
Call his father.

559
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,720
Ask him.

560
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,590
We can't depend on phone calls.

561
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,130
You know very well

562
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,890
That anyone can say anything over the phone.

563
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,710
Besides, just a few days ago, his phone had accidentally ended up with

564
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,857
Besides, just a few days ago, his phone had accidentally ended up with Miss Hania.

565
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,360
I need a letter.

566
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,890
A permission letter,

567
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,960
Or...

568
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,490
Or?

569
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,000
Or an order from the court.

570
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
