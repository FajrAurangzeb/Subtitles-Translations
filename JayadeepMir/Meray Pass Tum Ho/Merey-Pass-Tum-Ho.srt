1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,351
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

2
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:15,017
<i>Of forgetting as you leave;</i>

3
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:22,507
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

4
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:29,142
<i>From my life, now that you're leaving.</i>

5
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:35,667
<i>As nothing more than a formality, if nothing else,</i>

6
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:43,568
<i>Turn back and glance at me for a moment;</i>

7
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:50,343
<i>Fulfil the vows of our bond for once</i>

8
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:55,939
<i>As you break them.</i>

9
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,764
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

10
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:19,312
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

11
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:24,746
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

12
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:29,548
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

13
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:32,331
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

14
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:37,673
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

15
00:01:37,673 --> 00:01:40,504
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

16
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:43,217
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

17
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:45,998
<i>Bless you with this parting,</i>

18
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:51,428
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

19
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:57,462
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

20
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:02,591
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

21
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:29,586
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

22
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:32,208
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

23
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:40,091
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

24
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,951
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

25
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:48,641
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

26
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:54,019
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

27
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,749
<i>What does it matter, if I don't have</i>

28
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:02,243
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

29
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:05,004
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

30
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:10,373
<i>That I had you;</i>

31
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,193
<i>But, from you, I have learnt</i>

32
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,889
<i>That, even in love,</i>

33
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,647
<i>One could rather betray,</i>

34
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:24,337
<i>One could rather repulse.</i>

<i>Just until yesterday,</i>

37
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,256
<i>Your hand was in mine,</i>

38
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:10,355
<i>And your heart beat in mine;</i>

39
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:13,110
<i>These ebrious eyes</i>

40
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,520
<i>That have altered beyond recognition -</i>

41
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:26,794
<i>There was a time when I was their ardent devotee.</i>

42
00:04:26,794 --> 00:04:32,222
<i>Should you chance upon me somewhere,</i>

43
00:04:32,222 --> 00:04:39,540
<i>Surreptitiously, turn your gaze the other way, and move away.</i>

44
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,191
<i>I have to live out my days</i>

45
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,065
<i>Without you</i>

46
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:48,799
<i>I have to live out my days</i>

47
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,464
<i>Without you</i>

48
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:59,087
<i>I am destined, now, to live out my days without you.</i>
