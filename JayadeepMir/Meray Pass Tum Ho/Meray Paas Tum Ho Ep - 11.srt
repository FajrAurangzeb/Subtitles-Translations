1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,810
I can't think of anything, Shehwar...

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,460
I don't feel like going home when I'm with you,

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,200
And --

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,630
My intentions begin to falter when I'm home.

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,230
He won't let me go to office.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,246
He's firm about that.

7
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:24,326
Then?

8
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,160
What then?

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,640
You'd have to decide.

10
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,099
Decide what?

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:34,429
Who'd you rather live with?

12
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,010
Me,

13
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,686
Or him?

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,416
Tell me,

15
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,396
Or I can disconnect while you sit back and think.

16
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:52,160
No, please don't.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,660
Alright, tell me how much you trust me.

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,020
You shouldn't be asking this now.

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,430
Then, why do your intentions begin to falter?

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,870
Take the leash of 'marriage' off your neck

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,516
And shove it in his face.

22
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:09,076
What do you mean?

23
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,510
Ask him to divorce you.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,036
Divorce?

25
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:16,740
Is there any problem?

26
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,530
He won't divorce me, Shehwar.

27
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,250
Leave that to me.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,916
What about Rumi?

29
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,210
What's with him?

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,980
Whatever does a kid want?

31
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,440
Things that he likes?

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,380
He'll get whatever he can lay his finger on.

33
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,670
By the time he'd grow up,

34
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,440
He would've found out that there's something called 'divorce' too.

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,966
The times have changed.

36
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:49,580
More than bonding with parents,

37
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,467
Kids look at what they're getting from them.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:56,342
He's coming to return the 500,000 to you.

39
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:58,530
He may misbehave, too.

40
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,576
Just let him come.

41
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:08,936
If he misbehaves with me, the security guards will throw him out of the office.

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,126
Listen.

43
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,826
Yes?

44
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:14,980
Should I talk to him?

45
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,187
What'd you talk about?

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,790
I'll ask him to strike a deal with me.

47
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,211
Take his money,

48
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,646
And set you free.

49
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,597
Money for what?

50
00:02:29,226 --> 00:02:31,760
You won't get it.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,000
A large sum of money crushes large sorrows under its weight.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,910
Naturally, he'd feel the sorrow of leaving you.

53
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,476
So, let's buy that sorrow.

54
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:44,166
It'll lead to a fight, Shehwar.

55
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,579
Then, he won't worry that your security guards might throw him out.

56
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,860
Just tell me this -

57
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,300
If he asked you,

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,620
'Do you want a divorce'?

59
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,877
You'd say,

60
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,148
'Yes'.

61
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,940
'I want a divorce'.

62
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,260
I'd said it last night, too.

63
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,846
But he didn't agree.

64
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,066
He started explaining to me like I'm a kid.

65
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,220
Well, then, we'll talk later.

66
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,200
Just let him come here.

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,300
Let's take a look at his price,

68
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,466
And see how much he sells for.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,762
Mr Danish!

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,666
Here.

71
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:39,417
There's a cheque for 80,000 Rupees in this.

72
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,230
Please, don't say 'Thank you'.

73
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,986
Alright, I have to go.

74
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:45,980
I'll be late on the way back.

75
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,026
Alright.

76
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:47,956
No problem.

77
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:49,986
Wait.

78
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,433
You're fine, aren't you?

79
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,372
Yes.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,476
I can come with you if you want.

81
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,236
No.

82
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,136
I thought I'd ask because you seemed a bit worried.

83
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:03,979
It's --

84
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:06,247
Just that I'm a bit late.

85
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,936
Alright, go.
-Okay, then.

86
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,700
Is he there?

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:00,900
N

88
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,190
No

89
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,380
Not

90
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,580
Not 

91
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:01,900
Not y

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,110
Not ye

93
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,550
Not yet

94
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,216
Not yet.

95
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,360
He's left the bank; he'll be there anytime.

96
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,806
Just let him come.

97
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,890
Yes?

98
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,036
A certain Mr Danish is here, sir.

99
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,137
Have him sit. Let him have some tea...

100
00:06:46,137 --> 00:06:47,967
Send him when I ask you to.

101
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,898
Okay, sir.

102
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,902
Please wait a while. The boss is busy.

103
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:57,642
Okay, I'll wait.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,586
Hello?

105
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,920
He's here.

106
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,880
Before you?

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,480
No.

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,170
I've had him sit at the reception.

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,430
He'll understand his place when he'll wait a while.

110
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,600
Pack your bags.

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
Why?

112
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,220
He'll divorce you today,

113
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,810
And I'll come to take you home myself.

114
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,280
The home that you deserve.

115
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,600
But, Shehwar --
-Don't think about Rumi.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,346
I won't let there be any problem for him.

117
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:15,926
I hope you trust me.

118
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,550
Yeah...

119
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,598
I do trust you.

120
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,910
Leave your money and jewellery there.

121
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,180
It'll help him.

122
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,396
I will, sure,

123
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,430
But my heart doesn't quite think

124
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,770
That he'll divorce me so easily.

125
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,606
But mine does,

126
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,216
And I know

127
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,190
Exactly what I have to say.

128
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,060
He'll be knocked for six to hear it.

129
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,646
Hear what?

130
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,807
My words.

131
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:49,120
It's words that can win a heart,

132
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,346
And words that can take a life.

133
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,756
Okay, bye.

134
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm calling him.

135
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,520
Shehwar --

136
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,030
Be careful.

137
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,956
Wish me luck.

138
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:13,219
Good luck.

139
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,956
Right.

140
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:31,876
Send Mr Danish in.

141
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,620
Please, come.

142
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,179
Right.

143
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,470
Won't you take your bag?

144
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,676
Are you Ms Mehwish's husband?

145
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,206
Yes.
-Please, come.

146
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,950
Come in, Mr Danish. What a pleasant surprise!

147
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,930
Sorry, but I had an important meeting.

148
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:08,810
Come. Please, sit.

149
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,061
Tell me, sir,

150
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:13,376
What'd you like to have? Tea or coffee?

151
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,606
Nothing; thank you.

152
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,413
I won't have anything at your place.

153
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:20,161
Oh --

154
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,810
Alright, Mr Danish,

155
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,556
Pray tell what brings you here.

156
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:33,000
You've been too kind to Mehwish.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,020
I'm here to return every bit of that kindness that I can.

158
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,026
Such as?

159
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,146
Such as

160
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:43,140
500,000 here,

161
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,890
This necklace...

162
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,526
You gave her this necklace,

163
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,436
But it's an albatross around my neck.

164
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:58,197
I've come to take it off.

165
00:10:58,197 --> 00:10:59,187
I figure

166
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:03,740
You've been angry with her for going to Islamabad without asking.

167
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,980
There's a lot I'm angry at, Mr Shehwar.

168
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,696
But I'm no longer in a position

169
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:15,027
To be angry with her for going to Islamabad.

170
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:19,120
The thing is,

171
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,820
That ours was a 'love marriage'.

172
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,160
We've got a son, Mr Shehwar.

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,766
We've got dreams we've cherished for ages.

174
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:36,510
A fear of those dreams shattering has struck me.

175
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,040
So, take these things of yours,

176
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,640
And hand me the receipt.

177
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,560
I won't even look back at you when leaving.

178
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,133
But she will.

179
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:55,550
She'll look for me,

180
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,130
And when one's looking for someone,

181
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,980
One can't see anyone else on the way.

182
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,180
Neither an old 'love marriage',

183
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,210
Nor sweet Rumi,

184
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,150
Nor dreams that could never have been fulfilled.

185
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,480
You're crossing the line, Mr Shehwar,

186
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,530
And I want this conversation to end with a 'Thank you', 'It's okay', and 'Bye bye'.

187
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,710
I want the same -

188
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,580
That you divorce Mehwish,

189
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,566
I say 'Thank you' to you,

190
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:28,016
You say 'It's okay', and leave with a 'Bye bye'.

191
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,929
That's the spirit.

192
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,460
Otherwise, she was worried you'd be furious to hear something like this.

193
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,960
Who?

194
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,986
Mehwish, of course.

195
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,426
Take all of this,

196
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,730
And give me the receipt.

197
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,016
I'd need it.

198
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,150
I couldn't even complete my line.

199
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,130
I'd known that you'd come to return the money

200
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,350
And the necklace to me,

201
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,970
But didn't know that you'd

202
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,627
Still hold on to Mehwish.

203
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:06,880
Let go of her, too, sir.

204
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,340
What good is holding on to a wife who isn't even yours in the first place?

205
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,000
The fact is that she isn't yours anymore.

206
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,650
Don't strive for her.

207
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,996
I have a compliment for you.

208
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,700
Yes, please?

209
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,506
You're the most vile person in this world,

210
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:31,597
Sinking in this arrogance, intoxicated with wealth.

211
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:34,500
What are you, then?

212
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,990
You're holding fast to a woman who doesn't even want to live with you

213
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,860
Just because of the fact that you're married to her.

214
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,980
She made a mistake --

215
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,910
She went to Islamabad with you without asking me.

216
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,380
She's very sorry about it, in fact --
-Oh?

217
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,700
Is this how she's sorry?

218
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,976
Just a minute.

219
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,376
Here.

220
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,050
You'd see when you take a look.

221
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,120
Have some water.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,946
I said she's made a mistake.

223
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:51,750
With a trader like you, a woman's delighted

224
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,870
To hear a higher price.

225
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,980
This delight leads one to make a mistake.

226
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,520
Only later does one realise

227
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
That, no matter the price, if a woman's sold,

228
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,576
She becomes cheap.

229
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:11,406
I can offer you 50 million.

230
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:14,126
For what?

231
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,576
For divorcing Mehwish.

232
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,909
Don't trouble yourself.

233
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:31,980
You'd be wishing, right now, to throw that glass in my face,

234
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,970
Or sap away my blood,

235
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,990
But that's not wise.

236
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,210
Why do you trouble yourself for a woman

237
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,940
Who isn't even loyal to you?

238
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,920
She's forgotten your 'love marriage',

239
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,570
And that you've got a son,

240
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,420
And that there were dreams the two of you cherished.

241
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,180
You may still cherish them, mate,

242
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,680
But she's jumped ship to fulfil them.

243
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,270
Didn't I show you something

244
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,470
A short while ago?

245
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,860
Here's something for you to hear.

246
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,286
Our conversation over the phone.

247
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,050
He's here.

248
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,950
Before you?

249
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,530
No.

250
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,200
I've had him sit at the reception.

251
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,439
He'll understand his place when he'll wait a while.

252
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,660
Pack your bags.

253
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,836
Why?

254
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,950
He'll divorce you today,

255
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,550
And I'll come to take you home myself.

256
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,540
The home that you deserve.

257
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,300
But, Shehwar --
-Don't think about Rumi.

258
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,030
I won't let there be any problem for him.

259
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,920
I hope you trust me.

260
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah...

261
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,390
I do trust you.

262
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,730
Leave your money and jewellery there.

263
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,050
It'll help him.

264
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,230
I will, sure,

265
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,250
But my heart doesn't quite think

266
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,050
That he'll divorce me so easily.

267
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,840
But mine does,

268
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,526
And I know

269
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:20,480
Exactly what I have to say.

270
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,330
He'll be knocked for six to hear it.

271
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,970
Hear what?

272
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,080
My words.

273
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,440
It's words that can win a heart,

274
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,240
And words that can take a life.

275
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,990
Okay, bye.

276
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm calling him.

277
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,530
Be careful.

278
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,116
Wish me luck.

279
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:46,616
Good luck.

280
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,010
Pack your bags.

281
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,710
Why?

282
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,200
He'll divorce you today,

283
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,760
And I'll come to take you home myself.

284
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,720
The home that you deserve.

285
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,960
Why do you trouble yourself for a woman

286
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,710
Who isn't even loyal to you?

287
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:29,590
She's forgotten her 'love marriage' to you,

288
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,270
And that you've got a son,

289
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,120
And that there were dreams the two of you cherished.

290
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,960
You may still cherish them, mate,

291
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,730
But she's jumped ship to fulfil them.

292
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,790
But my heart doesn't quite think

293
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,470
That he'll divorce me so easily.

294
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,240
Wish me luck.

295
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,296
Good luck.

296
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,957
Okay,

297
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:22,676
Monty,

298
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:23,866
You may go.

299
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:24,820
Are you sure?

300
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,034
You won't trip and fall now, would you?
-No -- I'm alright.

301
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,912
Alright, here's your medicines,

302
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,666
And your bag.

303
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,956
Okay.
-Thank you.

304
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,640
What happened, Papa?

305
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,800
Has Maman left?

306
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,290
No, she's sitting in the room.

307
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,330
Tell me, Papa, what happened?

308
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,670
Nothing, my dear...

309
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,890
Tell me, how did you get injured?

310
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,576
I had an accident.

311
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:07,136
Fell from the bike.

312
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:10,916
Don't you know how to ride a bike?

313
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,752
Maman, look, Papa's gotten injured again!

314
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:19,640
The bandage looks bigger

315
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,376
Than the wound.

316
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:22,766
Did you see a doctor?

317
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,330
That's where I'm coming from.

318
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,216
He gave me a shot, too.

319
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:27,996
And

320
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:31,979
He's told me to apply this medicine to it.

321
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:36,556
Could you get me a cup of tea?

322
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:38,966
I will.

323
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,397
Did you run into a car?

324
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:44,416
Did you run into a car?

325
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,040
Yes.

326
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,440
Did you bleed, too?

327
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,470
A little.

328
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,279
I'll be fine by tomorrow morning.

329
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,450
Just a minute.

330
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,030
Yes, Mr Matin?

331
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,340
You didn't come.

332
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,630
What do I tell you, Mr Matin...

333
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,820
I had an accident.

334
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,020
My head's been wounded.

335
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,270
I've just gotten it dressed and gotten home.

336
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,500
Sorry.

337
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,310
No, it's okay.

338
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,370
Take care of yourself.

339
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,080
Right...

340
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,280
You were a bit worried today.

341
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,616
I was a bit worried, seeing you leave.

342
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:35,560
You ride your bike so fast, too...

343
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,436
Yes, sometimes...

344
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:40,540
But I won't, now.

345
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,000
Take good care of yourself.

346
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,426
Listen...

347
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:45,896
Yes?

348
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:48,287
I'll return your 80,000 tomorrow.

349
00:21:48,287 --> 00:21:50,486
So quickly? How?

350
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,786
You'd said it'd take a couple of months.

351
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,080
It didn't.

352
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,260
A couple of months passed in a moment.

353
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,396
I picked up my 80,000 and came back.

354
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:02,716
Surely,

355
00:22:02,716 --> 00:22:05,615
Mr Danish, you're alright?

356
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,570
Yes, it's --

357
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,130
Just this injury; otherwise, I'm fine.

358
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,826
Are you coming to office tomorrow?

359
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:12,596
Yes.

360
00:22:12,596 --> 00:22:14,617
Sure.

361
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,437
See you, then.

362
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:19,327
See you.

363
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,160
Did you finish your homework?

364
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,937
A long while ago.

365
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,470
Go to bed early.

366
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,596
Yes, Mr Shehwar?

367
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:47,570
Hope everything's fine.

368
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,680
Yeah.

369
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,950
Fine.

370
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,210
So, when should I come?

371
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,610
After 10 p.m.

372
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,489
Rumi goes to bed at 10.

373
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:59,180
Anything I could do for you?

374
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,210
You're so intelligent, Mr Shehwar,

375
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,550
But sometimes, you say such strange things.

376
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,860
Pray tell,

377
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,190
What else could I do for you?

378
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,340
You wound with every word.

379
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,430
I'd like you to hear a saying before you hang up -

380
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,530
'When one's wife chooses to let go',

381
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,870
'Do not stop her',

382
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,826
'For she's left before she lets go'.

383
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,320
I'll call before coming,

384
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,980
Or you can call me

385
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,590
When Rumi's gone to bed.

386
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,760
Bye.

387
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,981
Okay.

388
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,931
Bye.

389
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,626
Hey!

390
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:55,772
Sit.

391
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,786
I've listened to your call.

392
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,410
You, talking to Shehwar

393
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:17,770
Before I got there.

394
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,880
He'd recorded everything.

395
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,960
I even saw the selfies you clicked

396
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,740
With Shehwar at the hotel in Islamabad.

397
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,740
As I saw them, I didn't see

398
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,890
That you weren't wearing the black dress;

399
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,270
I saw

400
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,786
How you were truly smiling.

401
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,950
You're blooming.

402
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,440
That's exactly what I wanted -

403
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,840
That when you laugh,

404
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,050
It feel like there's no sorrow in the world,

405
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,930
And when you're blooming,

406
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,320
I tell the world that that's how flowers bloom.

407
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,020
But that bugger turned the tables on me.

408
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,610
He gave you everything I could only imagine,

409
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,886
But never give.

410
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:30,730
That was the day I surrendered before him.

411
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,390
I said,

412
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,930
'I've lost',

413
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,006
'And you've won'.

414
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,130
I'd gone there to save love,

415
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,680
But I could barely try to save my honour,

416
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,451
And I'm not sure if I've saved it.

417
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,970
People will start asking me tomorrow,

418
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,256
And I'll start lying.

419
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm worried more about Rumi.

420
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,200
He'd sleep for now,

421
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,500
But I don't know what I'd tell him

422
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,290
When he'd get up and ask where Maman is.

423
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,856
Tell him I'm out of the country.

424
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:27,797
I'd stay there a few days.

425
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,470
I'm sorry, Danish,

426
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,796
But I have to go.

427
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,990
What are you looking at?

428
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,370
I see that Rumi hasn't gone to sleep yet.

429
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,180
It's 8 right now.

430
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:10,140
Rumi doesn't sleep before 10.

431
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,420
Alright, pack your things.

432
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,230
Don't leave anything that's yours.

433
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,128
Ask --

434
00:28:20,128 --> 00:28:24,548
Me if you need any help.

435
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,370
I'll try and put Rumi to sleep.

436
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,237
Does it hurt?

437
00:29:08,237 --> 00:29:11,818
Yes, a lot.

438
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,100
Danish!

439
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,700
Rumi's fallen asleep.

440
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,956
He has?

441
00:29:57,956 --> 00:29:59,956
Good.

442
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,904
He's snoring.

443
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,986
It's almost 10.

444
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,246
Packed your things?

445
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:36,300
Yes.

446
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,790
I'll call Mr Shehwar.

447
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,640
Where's my cellphone?

448
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,227
Over there.

449
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,891
Listen...

450
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,826
Can you do me a favour?

451
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,380
Go on.

452
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,881
Just a random thought.

453
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:10,359
Don't leave tonight.

454
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,690
I'm not stopping you.

455
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,846
Just requesting.

456
00:32:16,846 --> 00:32:19,226
You can leave in the morning.

457
00:32:19,226 --> 00:32:21,436
Rumi would've gone to school,

458
00:32:21,436 --> 00:32:23,646
And I, to office,

459
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:27,707
And you, <i>home</i>.

460
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:30,140
The night is a long one, Mehwish,

461
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,210
And it feels like it'll never pass.

462
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:37,130
The night will fall tomorrow, too.

463
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,776
But a day will dawn before that.

464
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:44,270
I would've gathered the courage by the time the day would pass.

465
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,953
I would've told enough lies to Rumi

466
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:51,703
To while the night away acting them out.

467
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,964
Please.

468
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,937
It'd seriously help me a lot.

469
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:06,180
Tell Rumi the truth after a few days.

470
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,420
If he came across me somewhere,

471
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,790
It'd hurt him.

472
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,050
Right.

473
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,806
So, you'd leave in the morning, wouldn't you?

474
00:33:23,616 --> 00:33:26,000
Talk to Shehwar.

475
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,816
Of course, I'd have to.

476
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:30,346
I will.

477
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,646
Hello?

478
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,178
Danish.

479
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:48,116
It's Danish, Mr Shehwar.

480
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,880
Yeah, I know.

481
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,576
Has Rumi gone to bed?

482
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,456
Yes, he has.

483
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:56,926
But I'm a bit afraid.

484
00:33:56,926 --> 00:34:00,700
No -- Not like <i>that</i>.

485
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,170
I figured that Mehwish should leave in the morning

486
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:06,840
When Rumi's gone to his school,

487
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,306
And I, to office...

488
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,390
Sometimes, he gets up in the night.

489
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:17,050
He searches for his Maman when he's up.

490
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,360
It doesn't happen everyday,

491
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,990
But I fear it'll be very difficult for me

492
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,986
If he got up tonight.

493
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:25,760
Ask Mehwish.

494
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,381
What does she say?

495
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:31,670
She's asked me to ask you.

496
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,276
Oh --

497
00:34:33,276 --> 00:34:34,606
Be a man.

498
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,240
You sometimes talk like kids.

499
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,940
I know.

500
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,090
Please, do me this favour.

501
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,250
I'd be delighted.

502
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,757
I'd bless you from the depths of my heart.

503
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:47,427
Okay, fine.

504
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:49,750
I'll come at 9 a.m.

505
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,380
Perfect.

506
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,206
Thank you.

507
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,976
Thank you so much.

508
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,326
He's agreed to it.

509
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,500
Have you struck a deal with him?

510
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,550
Deal?

511
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,120
Have you taken money to divorce me?

512
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,350
No?

513
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,780
Why are you asking that?

514
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,230
It just occurred to me...

515
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,390
Seeing how you were pleading,

516
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,340
And thanking him when he agreed,

517
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,926
I thought there was something like that.

518
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:41,340
I haven't taken money to give you to him.

519
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,409
It was something he said -

520
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:47,400
'When one's wife chooses to let go',

521
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,710
'Never stop her',

522
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:57,990
'For she's left before she lets go'.

523
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,100
Although, yes,

524
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,680
He'd offered me 50 million...

525
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,970
Come again?

526
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,926
50 million.

527
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,720
It'd hurt me

528
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,520
That you'd landed straight in the market when you left home.

529
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,466
Shut up!

530
00:36:13,466 --> 00:36:15,430
Do you know how much 50 million is?

531
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,646
I know.

532
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:20,880
I could buy a lot,

533
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,170
But not that one moment

534
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,490
When I'd be eager to get back home,

535
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,200
When I'd see you open the door

536
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,960
For me...

537
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:38,330
I just saw you.

538
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,876
I never put my needs above you.

539
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,190
I can understand.

540
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,267
Stay in your well,

541
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:58,117
Croaking like the proverbial frog.

542
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,021
Listen!

543
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,410
Should I get something to eat?

544
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,910
Should I get something to eat?
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

545
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,840
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

546
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:19,509
<i>Of forgetting as you leave;</i>

547
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:26,230
<i>Fulfil the vows of our bond for once</i>

548
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,340
<i>As you break it.</i>

549
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:45,830
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

550
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,604
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

551
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,668
Stay in your well,

552
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:53,390
Croaking like the proverbial frog.

553
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,180
Croaking like the proverbial frog.
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

554
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,210
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

555
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,960
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

556
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,690
<i>Bless you with this parting,</i>

557
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,262
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

558
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,227
He's gone to the market.

559
00:38:10,227 --> 00:38:11,967
He said, 'I'll get something to eat'.

560
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,410
For you?

561
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,370
I'm not hungry at all.

562
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,590
He's a proper character, mate.

563
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:22,550
I've never seen a man like him before.

564
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,056
Like what?

565
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:28,870
When he sat in my office, it seemed as if he'd kill me.

566
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,030
Don't even ask about his furious eyes.

567
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,530
After he heard the phone recording,

568
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,260
He was relaxed.

569
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,650
He cooled down.

570
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,600
He looked at me when the recording ended,

571
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,495
And smiled, saying...

572
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,380
She has such a beautiful voice.

573
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,640
Yeah.

574
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,370
She studied with me at University.

575
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,870
Know what,

576
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,200
I hadn't seen her face first.

577
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,420
The sound of her voice had startled me.

578
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,706
I turned back

579
00:39:17,706 --> 00:39:20,600
And found her on one of the seats behind me.

580
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,000
She looked back,

581
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,270
And curled up, unsettled,

582
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,070
As if my gaze had pinched her.

583
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,670
I listen in on her at home

584
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,090
When she's talking to Rumi.

585
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,500
I call her from the office every now and then, everyday.

586
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,080
When she answers the phone

587
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:55,070
With a 'Hello',

588
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,780
I quiver for a moment.

589
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,290
But now,

590
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,839
Even her 'Hello' has lost that touch, as in --

591
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,015
Lost it <i>for me</i>.

592
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,700
Anyway, what do you think?

593
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,660
Do women two-time?

594
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,360
They do.

595
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,426
There are scores of examples.

596
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:20,120
Oh...

597
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,220
I used to think that only men two-time.

598
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,866
But

599
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:29,070
I'm noticing something -

600
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:32,500
When a woman two-times,

601
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,480
She goes the whole nine yards.

602
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,000
Didn't you get it?

603
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,830
I mean, she completely turns away.

604
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,470
Sometimes, I think

605
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,240
That she'd remember my name in the morning,

606
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,100
So that she may not slip and utter someone else's name.

607
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,476
Smile, would you? I'm talking about <i>your</i> name.

608
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,570
What have you thought?

609
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,457
I'm thinking...

610
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:16,270
Let me just grasp it...

611
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,000
Alright, tell me - When she went to Islamabad,

612
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,506
Did she agree, like, instantly, without any hesitation?

613
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:25,410
Yes.

614
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,750
She hesitated a bit.

615
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:31,410
But you know very well there's no hesitation in love.

616
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,530
She must be a bit afraid when she stepped inside the hotel room.

617
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,590
Leave it be... What are you talking about?
-No.

618
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,110
I'm just reassuring myself.

619
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,071
Yes.

620
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:45,651
She wasn't afraid.

621
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:47,338
But a bit nonplussed.

622
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,280
She must be taking a good look at the room.

623
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,310
She's never seen the room of a 5-star hotel.

624
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,650
I could never show her one.

625
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,570
Dad would come at my throat.

626
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,350
If I so much as thought of taking a bribe,

627
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,010
He'd stop and scold me.

628
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,046
Just a few days ago, I thought I would,

629
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:14,460
And even brought a million home,

630
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,840
But he created such a scene

631
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,126
That I had to return it.

632
00:42:20,126 --> 00:42:26,152
But as far as I know, your father passed away almost 5 years ago?

633
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:28,212
Yes.

634
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:32,310
It's been four and a half years.

635
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,310
But if I think about doing something wrong,

636
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,000
He shows up in my dreams,

637
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,860
And slaps me right in the face.

638
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,420
You're not well.

639
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,990
No, I'm perfectly alright.

640
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,790
I'm just asking for my knowledge.

641
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,934
The thing is

642
00:43:00,934 --> 00:43:02,747
That I'd just

643
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,150
Heard about it.

644
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:10,120
I'd never seen it before, Mr Shehwar.

645
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,700
It's alright...

646
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,510
She's decided...

647
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,420
You can take her.

648
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,700
I'll go home and call you.

649
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:25,571
I'll tell you when you should come.

650
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,051
Take care of her.

651
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,971
Sure.

652
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,080
Bye.

653
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,731
Just a minute.

654
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,120
This...

655
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,580
This is mine; I'd borrowed this from someone.

656
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,000
Goodbye.

657
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
