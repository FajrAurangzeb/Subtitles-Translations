1
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,030
He used to ask everyday;

2
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,890
Then, he'd ask

3
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,630
Whenever he'd see her picture,

4
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,470
Or anything related to her;

5
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,542
He's stopped asking now.

6
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,450
It was he who said to me one day,

7
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,730
'Get me into boarding school, Papa'.

8
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,600
'I'd come to you'

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,984
'When I've grown up'.

10
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,323
That was the day I felt he'd grown up.

11
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,051
Just look at your condition!

12
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:42,380
That's what I'm thinking.

13
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,680
A few months of grieving is enough.

14
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm thinking I'd change my condition.

15
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,300
Please, help me, will you?

16
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,131
Do you need money?

17
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,850
Yes.

18
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,868
How much?

19
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:04,820
Some 200 to 250 million?

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,000
Perhaps even more.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,369
Not on loan. Personal.

22
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,340
What'd you do with it?

23
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,281
I'm thinking what I'd do without it.

24
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:26,974
I want to be a businessman, Mr Matin.

25
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,500
Have everything I want -

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,440
Friendship, loyalty, love...

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Everything sells; I'll buy it all.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,581
You're angry.

29
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:40,960
You're angry.
-No.

30
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,648
I'm fully in my senses.

31
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:50,551
She opened my eyes as she left.

32
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,540
I swear, Mr Matin,

33
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,100
I was not angry with her one bit when she was leaving.

34
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,521
I was angry with Shehwar.

35
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:09,090
You bugger, if you've actually fallen in love,

36
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,360
Talk about someone

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,302
Who'd stay true to her vows of loyalty.

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
It is not in a woman's nature to be disloyal,

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,410
And one who's disloyal is unworthy of being called a woman.

40
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,030
See for yourself.

41
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,650
Good men

42
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,230
Don't make this world go round.

43
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:45,081
Good women do.

44
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:48,140
You only need to move on.

45
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,460
Surely, you'll find someone

46
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,286
Who'd tell you, 'I make this world go round'.

47
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,130
Could I get the bill, lad?

48
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,270
I'll pay.

49
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,660
Leave it be, Mr Matin.

50
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,190
What does it matter?

51
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,182
Just think about how one could get 200 million.

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,062
240 Rupees, sir.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,810
We'll meet again, Mr Matin.

54
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,938
Please, do think about it.

55
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,300
Good morning, Danish.
-Good morning.

56
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,390
Please, come and sit.

57
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,470
Please call Miss Hania.

58
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,150
Please call Miss Hania.
-She's coming.

59
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,690
She's coming.
-Okay.

60
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,706
You may leave.

61
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,876
Right...

62
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,130
Mr Danish...

63
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,504
This is your son's progress report...

64
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,071
Exams...

65
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:17,790
Average marks - 42%.

66
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,151
Attitude...

67
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:22,530
'Does not cooperate'.

68
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,710
Games, sports...

69
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,680
'Does not participate'.

70
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,010
Student interaction...

71
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,616
Zero.

72
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,520
May I come in?

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,880
Please, come in, Miss Hania.

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,030
Please, sit.

75
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,830
Good morning.

76
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,690
This is Miss Hania. She's in charge of Rumi's class.

77
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,920
And he's Rumi's father, Mr Danish.

78
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,550
Yes, I'm his father.

79
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,360
First, I'd like to know why you've chosen to get him into boarding school.

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Because he'd suggested it himself.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
God...

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,430
<i>He</i> suggested it to you?

83
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,840
And you agreed?

84
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,040
How many children do you have?

85
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,812
Just Rumi.

86
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,920
He suggested it, and you got him into boarding school.

87
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,950
I think I was wrong...

88
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,100
Wasn't I?

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,430
And I think he won't able to continue in this school.

90
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,543
No -- surely -- please...

91
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,416
With respect, sir,

92
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,490
I think he has a problem.

93
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,666
He'd pull a long face when you talk to him, sits all alone in recess, and homework?

94
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,120
He'd pull a long face when you talk to him, sits all alone in recess, and homework? Always incomplete.

95
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,900
He doesn't answer when you ask him,

96
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,250
And thinks for long before saying anything.

97
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,886
Mostly, he just goes on thinking. He never says anything.

98
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,440
Please --

99
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,266
Give him one chance...

100
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,861
Just one chance.
-With all due respect, sir,

101
00:07:55,861 --> 00:08:01,220
It's affecting the other students very much.

102
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,680
In fact, a few of them have even said

103
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,880
That they're afraid of him.

104
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,560
Why are they afraid of him?

105
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,580
Is he the Dracula or something?

106
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,140
No...

107
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,510
He's absolutely normal.

108
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,781
Intelligent.

109
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:20,600
There's just been -- some problems -- and he's been behaving like this because of that.

110
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,695
Just give him one chance; I assure you -

111
00:08:23,695 --> 00:08:26,320
If he didn't improve,

112
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,096
I'd withdraw him from here myself.

113
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,300
Alright,

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,590
Please ask his mother to come and state her committment.

115
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,770
I can give him a chance.

116
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,495
How would I ask his mother?

117
00:08:41,495 --> 00:08:44,950
She's divorced me and left the country.

118
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,260
How'd you have her commit?

119
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,364
I'm sorry...

120
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,610
The thing is,

121
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,770
I can't hear anything against my son.

122
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,060
He's my son.

123
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,020
Look,

124
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,460
I know he's very intelligent.

125
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,120
He's just grieved about being separated from his mother,

126
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,350
That's why he's been performing like this.

127
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,230
I'll meet him today,

128
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,676
Talk to him,

129
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:17,110
And if he promised me, you'll see,

130
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,870
He'll be fine.

131
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,240
His results will be good, too.

132
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,105
It's okay, Mr Danish.

133
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:28,560
We understand.

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,090
Take your time.

135
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,566
It's okay.

136
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:33,545
Thank you.

137
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:36,263
Thank you so much.

138
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:40,209
And I'm sorry again,

139
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:41,052
I --

140
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:45,102
Spoke a bit too loudly.
-No, it's okay.

141
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:46,090
Okay,

142
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,963
Good day.

143
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,201
Good day.

144
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,164
Papa!

145
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,840
Your Principal had called me.

146
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,180
I know.

147
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,500
And your class teacher...

148
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,997
She said that you can't continue in this school.

149
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,588
I've seen your report card.

150
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,980
Exams? Only 42%.

151
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,470
Attitude? Not satisfactory. Debates...

152
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,660
You don't participate...

153
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,710
Interaction? Zero!

154
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,385
You don't talk to anyone, do you?

155
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:24,656
Don't answer questions when asked.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,380
Do you know,

157
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,280
My grief is greater than yours.

158
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,017
A mother's a mother even after she's left.

159
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:42,180
A wife's no longer a wife when she's left.

160
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,260
Still, I go to office everyday.

161
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,630
Work hard.

162
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,250
Go home and cook myself food.

163
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,240
And what are you?

164
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,610
A coward?

165
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,660
Accepted defeat at the slightest scratch?

166
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,990
You didn't even think

167
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,150
That Papa would be insulted when he'd be called to the school.

168
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,080
Tell me, can't you continue here?

169
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,810
I was furious when I heard that.

170
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,100
I said to the teacher angrily, 'My son is very intelligent'.

171
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,670
'Give him one more chance'.

172
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,370
'He's grieving over being separated from his mother',

173
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,870
'So, he's not performing well'.

174
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,720
'Just give him a chance',

175
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,121
'He'll give you results'.

176
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,648
Was I wrong in saying that?

177
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,000
No problem.

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,010
One's got to say something to save one's honour.

179
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,100
Do you know,

180
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,120
I too, cried once out of this grief.

181
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,130
I felt like I'm a coward.

182
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,270
But then I thought that I've got Rumi.

183
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,523
Rumi is my strength.

184
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,263
But know what, you're my weakness.

185
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,520
Okay.

186
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,808
Come and give me a hug.

187
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,990
Don't take anything I've said to heart.

188
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,963
One can study at another school.

189
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,950
Go now, it's time for your class.

190
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,566
I'll come and get you on Saturday.

191
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,934
Wait!

192
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,147
Your chocolates.

193
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,418
Thank you, Papa.

194
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,939
Listen, Papa...

195
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,500
Rumi is not your weakness.

196
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,461
Rumi is your strength.

197
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,290
Don't ever cry again, Papa.

198
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,902
Maman's no longer Maman when she's left.

199
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:53,554
Good morning, sir!

200
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:54,837
Good morning.

201
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,945
Tea or coffee?

202
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,023
I'd like some tea.

203
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,012
In a moment.

204
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:27,930
I got very late...

205
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,204
No problem.

206
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:31,813
I'd gone to Rumi's school.

207
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,477
His Principal had called me.

208
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:35,899
Look at this envelope.

209
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,197
Guess what's in it?

210
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,620
What is it?

211
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,710
You've been promoted, Mr Danish.

212
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,330
By the Lord's grace, you've become a 17th grade officer!

213
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,491
Oh!

214
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,830
Just an 'Oh'?

215
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,573
At least be delighted properly, Mr Danish!

216
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:01,058
I'm delighted.

217
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:02,990
Very delighted.

218
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,790
Then, how about some sweets?

219
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,228
Get some, quickly.

220
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,026
Alright, my good man, over here.

221
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,461
Here.

222
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,032
Here.

223
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,250
Get me some sweets.

224
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,480
Please, sit, will you?

225
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,088
His progress report's not very good.

226
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:33,173
As in, it's very bad.

227
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:36,380
And the teacher's said

228
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,080
That he's not normal.

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,250
Then?

230
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,980
Then, I met him.

231
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,180
I talked to him.

232
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,740
He's promised to me as I left.

233
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,690
Mr Danish,

234
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,430
You've been promoted.

235
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,120
What good is that, Mr Matin?

236
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,400
I mean, I --

237
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,390
I'm happy.

238
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,680
I've been promoted...

239
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,160
But his teacher's said...

240
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,927
That he can't continue in the school.

241
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,960
Yes?

242
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,630
No, I'm not in such a hurry.

243
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,120
Yes, I go to bed by 10 to 11 p.m.

244
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,650
Sometimes 12.

245
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,451
Okay.

246
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,341
Goodbye.

247
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,360
Mr Matin!

248
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,260
Haven't you had lunch?

249
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,820
I'd been waiting for you.

250
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,564
I've gotten habituated to your company.

251
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,424
Are you buying something?

252
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,370
No, I'm selling something.

253
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,220
What?

254
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,651
My flat.

255
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,520
But --

256
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,350
But you used to say...

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,058
But you used to say...
-I used to say a lot, Mr Matin.

258
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:26,946
But what does it matter if a man like me says anything?

259
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,771
Why are you selling your flat?

260
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:33,329
I kept on thinking when I got back after meeting you last night.

261
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,320
I remembered something someone had said once -

262
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,140
'In business, your first hundred thousand is the only thing that matters'.

263
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,380
But that's an old saying.

264
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,910
So, I figured that it's the first 10 million that matters,

265
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,990
And I thought I'd earn the first 10 million by selling the flat.

266
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,760
But that bugger's just giving me 7 million.

267
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,800
You'd start a business?

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,060
Didn't I tell you?

269
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,550
But Mr Danish,

270
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,190
One can't run a business along with a job.

271
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,630
I'll quit my job.

272
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,726
Mr Danish,

273
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,776
You've just been promoted today,

274
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:10,292
And now you're saying...
-Why are you getting so emotional, Mr Matin?

275
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,990
What do you think?

276
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,510
That I won't be able to live if I left this job?

277
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,170
Don't worry, then.

278
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,010
I'd live on.

279
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,110
But it'd surely kill me, Mr Matin, if I didn't get

280
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,420
My 250 million.

281
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,460
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

282
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,950
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

283
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,330
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

284
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:59,140
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

285
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,840
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

286
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,190
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

287
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,060
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

288
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,823
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

289
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:15,553
<i>Bless you with this parting,</i>

290
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:20,259
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

291
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,140
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

292
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,220
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

293
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,492
How are you, Mr Diwan?

294
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,575
What?

295
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,080
You're such an amazing partner!

296
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,930
And you're such a --

297
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,797
What?

298
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:12,371
Why aren't we getting married?

299
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:18,022
I want to call you 'hubby' too.

300
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Why are you laughing?

301
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,880
Have you grown tired of love?

302
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,959
Look at what you're saying!

303
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:32,965
I've only just realised what love truly is.

304
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,415
Tell me, when are we getting married?

305
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:42,360
Mind if I ask something?

306
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,560
Not at all.

307
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,330
Why do we want to get married to live together?

308
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,700
Why can't we just love and live together?

309
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,120
You're kidding.

310
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,830
No.

311
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,350
I'm not kidding.

312
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,673
It's a million dollar question.

313
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,280
We've been together for so many months,

314
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,330
We've toured all of Europe,

315
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,180
And it never felt for once

316
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,021
That one needs to marry to love.

317
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:16,730
Have you ever felt my love lacking?

318
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,906
Tell me.

319
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,330
Am I ever tired of you?

320
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,350
That's alright,

321
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,410
But --
-Why this 'but' when it's alright?

322
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,010
Why do you think like lower-middle class women,

323
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,800
Who'd pray to get married

324
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,241
To get to love?

325
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,270
Shehwar...

326
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,605
Didn't I just say...

327
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,971
Let there be just love...

328
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:52,250
When it seems important that we get married, we would.

329
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,610
And sweetheart,

330
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,404
There are divorces in marriages,

331
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:05,169
But none in love.

332
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,320
Sorry, I got a bit late.

333
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,050
It's no problem.

334
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,990
Has your anger cooled off?

335
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,680
Anger?

336
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,640
When was I angry?

337
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,800
You were

338
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,660
Talking about quitting the job the other day. I got a bit worried.

339
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,330
I didn't get worried at all.

340
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,120
I've talked about the flat.

341
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,780
The old dealer was tricking me.

342
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,224
The other one got me 8 million.

343
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:02,010
Sold the flat?

344
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,820
No.

345
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,160
Not yet.

346
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
I will, 10 days later.

347
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,600
I'd get the advance tomorrow, and resign after 10 days.

348
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,954
Please think again, Mr Danish.

349
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:22,026
I used to think too much, Mr Matin.

350
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:23,750
But now, I feel

351
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,785
That He gets angry when you think too much.

352
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:32,580
He just wants man to keep on working.

353
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,750
I'd like some tea.

354
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:37,122
And two <i>aloo parathas</i>.

355
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
Where'd you live after selling the flat?

356
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,280
I'd rent a flat.

357
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,030
And where'd you work?

358
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,306
I'd think about it when I've got the money in my account.

359
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:56,460
May I suggest something?

360
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,580
Why, sure, that's what I come to you for!

361
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,310
Please don't resign until your business is up and running.

362
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,509
You've grown old, Mr Matin.

363
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:11,859
Cowardly.

364
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,450
If one started a business thinking it'd not go well,

365
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:20,430
It would <i>never</i> go well,

366
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,720
And if I'm dishonest with my job,

367
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,000
I'd be earning what I don't deserve.

368
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,484
I can't do that.

369
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:31,640
I'd dive right into the sea, confident that I can swim;

370
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,320
I'd never wear a life jacket.

371
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,710
I'll get your <i>parathas</i>.

372
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,588
Alright.

373
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,301
Get married.

374
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,951
Why?

375
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:56,537
One needs a woman behind him to move on.

376
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,066
Do you believe that?

377
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,731
No one could believe it more than me.

378
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:05,137
But I don't.

379
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:08,230
Even if it is true,

380
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,370
I'll prove it wrong.

381
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,459
You should see a psychiatrist.

382
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,654
One often loses

383
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:24,940
One's battles because of anger.

384
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,450
She's left,

385
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,280
Just bless her.

386
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,550
If she gave you grief,

387
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,340
If she gave you grief, she also took your grief along.

388
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,040
Give her a salute and say,

389
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,930
'If you aren't mine, my dear',

390
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,441
'Know that I'm not yours either'.

391
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,790
Eight years ago,

392
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,270
When I said I'd 'met' my wife, I hadn't actually met her.

393
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:04,050
It had struck me down, and I realised that I'd fallen at her feet.

394
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,740
Her husband was with her.

395
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,140
Still, it pained her to see me hurt.

396
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,540
She picked me up from the footpath, supporting me,

397
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,330
And cleaned the wound on my feet.

398
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,240
Meanwhile,

399
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,130
Her husband had gone to get medicine for my wound.

400
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,060
I asked her,

401
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,526
'Didn't you feel the slightest hatred for me'?

402
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:47,640
She smiled,

403
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,740
And said,

404
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,210
'One pities the disloyal, Matin Ahmed',

405
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,835
'One doesn't hate them'.

406
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,008
Cigarette?

407
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,160
Her husband called the day before she died,

408
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,300
And said, 'Samina wants to talk'.

409
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,930
I talked to her.

410
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:53,459
She was gasping for breath.

411
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,000
She asked me,

412
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,796
'Does one ever get punished for disloyalty, Matin Ahmed'?

413
00:31:07,796 --> 00:31:12,819
I said, 'Yes'.

414
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:20,650
She asked, 'How much'?

415
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,610
I said,

416
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,884
'Those who are loyal'

417
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:31,330
'Wouldn't even get so great a reward'...

418
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,870
She said,

419
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,360
'Alright, Matin Ahmed',

420
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,026
'I forgive you'.

421
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,050
Her husband told me later, 'She asked me'

422
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,860
'Before she died',

423
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,140
'"When I said I'd forgiven Matin Ahmed, do you think I'd <i>actually</i> forgiven him"?'

424
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,658
Have your <i>parathas</i>. I won't be able to eat.

425
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,066
Could I get the bill,

426
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,876
My good man?

427
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,150
Bye, Mr Matin!

428
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,366
Mr Matin!

429
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,756
Mr Matin!

430
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,720
Quickly! Come here.

431
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,240
You too!

432
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,610
You too! Hurry!
-What happened?

433
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,460
It's the good sir!

434
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,760
Get him out quickly!

435
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,750
Here.

436
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,331
Quickly!

437
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,651
Careful there!

438
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,949
Mr Matin!
-What happened?

439
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,539
Careful!

440
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,850
Sir!

441
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,468
Are you alright, sir?

442
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,480
He's a very good man.

443
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,510
Right...

444
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,310
He's had a heart attack before.

445
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,130
At our bistro.

446
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,210
He used to smoke a lot back then, too.

447
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,490
Why don't you inform his family?

448
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,210
Do you know their details?

449
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,959
No.

450
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,056
Are you with Mr Matin?

451
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,190
Yes.
-Who would you be to him?

452
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,390
He's alright, isn't he?

453
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,270
He hasn't come to yet. Who are you to him?

454
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,221
I'm his friend and colleague.

455
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:28,450
Alright. Submit your ID card at the counter, and take his cell phone and purse.

456
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,776
Okay?
-Alright.

457
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,566
Thank you.

458
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,571
He lives in Gulshan.

459
00:37:43,571 --> 00:37:44,834
Call them, will you?

460
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:45,491
Who?

461
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:46,843
His family.

462
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:49,290
We'd called from his phone back then, too.

463
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,463
Look for 'My Daughter' on his phone.

464
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,530
Hello?

465
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:17,870
It's Danish here. Mr Matin's colleague.

466
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,100
You're his daughter, right?

467
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,400
Mr Matin's had a heart attack.

468
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,930
He's in the hospital's CCU.

469
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,980
Talk to her.

470
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,525
Hello?

471
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,224
Good evening.

472
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,090
Doctor,

473
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,485
How's Mr Matin?

474
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,750
Unfortunately, he's not good.

475
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,400
We're trying the last thing we could,

476
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,779
Just have faith.

477
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:14,500
Who's with Mr Matin?

478
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,546
Yes?

479
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:17,170
I'm sorry,

480
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,460
We tried our best,

481
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,701
But he didn't make it.

482
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,310
As it pleases the Lord...

483
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:25,178
Please, be brave.

484
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,142
Dad!

485
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,856
Dad!

486
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
