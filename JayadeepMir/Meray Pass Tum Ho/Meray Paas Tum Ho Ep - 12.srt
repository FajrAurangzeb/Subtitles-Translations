1
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,670
He's gone to the market.

2
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,380
He said, 'I'll get something to eat'.

3
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,840
For you?

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,810
I'm not hungry at all.

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,130
He's a proper character, mate.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,990
I've never seen a man like him before.

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,540
Like what?

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,280
When he sat in my office, it seemed as if he'd kill me.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,490
Don't even ask about his furious eyes.

10
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,970
After he heard the phone recording,

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,720
He was relaxed.

12
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,090
He cooled down.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,030
He looked at me when the recording ended,

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,580
And smiled, saying...

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,840
She has such a beautiful voice.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,896
Yeah.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,969
She studied with me at University.

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,300
Know what,

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,780
I hadn't seen her face first.

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,096
The sound of her voice had startled me.

21
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:31,190
I turned back

22
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,060
And found her on one of the seats behind me.

23
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,457
She looked back,

24
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:41,750
And curled up, unsettled,

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,631
As if my gaze had pinched her.

26
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,141
I listen in on her at home

27
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:56,530
When she's talking to Rumi.

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,969
I call her from the office every now and then, everyday.

29
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,546
When she answers the phone

30
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:08,560
With a 'Hello',

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,247
I quiver for a moment.

32
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:14,760
But now,

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,340
Even her 'Hello' has lost that touch, as in --

34
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,666
Lost it <i>for me</i>.

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,136
Anyway, what do you think?

36
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:28,130
Do women two-time?

37
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,820
They do.

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,900
There are scores of examples.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,626
Oh...

40
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:37,677
I used to think that only men two-time.

41
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,330
But

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,543
I'm noticing something -

43
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:46,034
When a woman two-times,

44
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:49,489
She goes the whole nine yards.

45
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,140
Didn't you get it?

46
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,320
I mean, she completely turns away.

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,980
Sometimes, I think

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,717
That she'd remember my name in the morning,

49
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:10,596
So that she may not slip and utter someone else's name.

50
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:15,890
Smile, would you? I'm talking about <i>your</i> name.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,990
What have you thought?

52
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,856
I'm thinking...

53
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:29,800
Let me just grasp it...

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,450
Alright, tell me - When she went to Islamabad,

55
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,986
Did she agree, like, instantly, without any hesitation?

56
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,890
Yes.

57
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,250
She hesitated a bit.

58
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,890
But you know very well there's no hesitation in love.

59
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,950
She must be a bit afraid when she stepped inside the hotel room.

60
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,060
Leave it be... What are you talking about?
-No.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,566
I'm just reassuring myself.

62
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,531
Yes.

63
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,110
She wasn't afraid.

64
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,856
But a bit nonplussed.

65
00:04:00,856 --> 00:04:03,807
She must be taking a good look at the room.

66
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:07,820
She's never seen the room of a 5-star hotel.

67
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,100
I could never show her one.

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,030
Dad would come at my throat.

69
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,860
If I so much as thought of taking a bribe,

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,510
He'd stop and scold me.

71
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,530
Just a few days ago, I thought I would,

72
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,970
And even brought a million home,

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,340
But he created such a scene

74
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,590
That I had to return it.

75
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,650
But as far as I know, your father passed away almost 5 years ago?

76
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,806
Yes.

77
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:45,890
It's been four and a half years.

78
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,840
But if I think about doing something wrong,

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,580
He shows up in my dreams,

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,266
And slaps me right in the face.

81
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,126
You're not well.

82
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,450
No, I'm perfectly alright.

83
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm just asking for my knowledge.

84
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,456
The thing is

85
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,230
That I'd just

86
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,640
Heard about it.

87
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,646
I'd never seen it before, M. Shehwar.

88
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,190
It's alright...

89
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,010
She's decided...

90
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,940
You can take her.

91
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,180
I'll go home and call you.

92
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,466
I'll tell you when you should come.

93
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,550
Take care of her.

94
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,638
Sure.

95
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,516
Bye.

96
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,356
Just a minute.

97
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,626
This...

98
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:25,070
This is mine; I'd borrowed this from someone.

99
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,918
Goodbye.

100
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,240
And I thought the two of you had struck a deal,

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,610
That he's taken money to divorce me.

102
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,650
Yes, I'd made an offer...

103
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,760
50 million?

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,716
I think I'd said 50 million.

106
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm surprised the money couldn't break him.

107
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,850
He didn't know how priceless you are in my eyes.

108
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,170
He believes that one can't name a price for one's love.

109
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,840
I say,

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,820
That, if anything, is what has a price.

111
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,980
The higher the price,

112
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,906
The greater the love.

113
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:36,130
And I thought you would've pitied him.

114
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,810
I did.

115
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,490
So much that I agreed to what he said,

116
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,816
And let you remain with him for another night.

117
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:51,237
He's here.

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,780
Okay.

119
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,946
See you.

120
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,310
Why were you ringing the bell?

121
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,460
Rumi could've gotten up.

122
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,560
I'd called first, but it was busy.

123
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,370
Why have you brought all of this?

124
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,966
Who'd have it all?

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,390
I've always been bringing so much for 7 years.

126
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,526
I do on this day.

127
00:08:49,526 --> 00:08:52,770
This day?

128
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,626
Today's our last wedding anniversary.

129
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,720
Just 15 minutes left!

130
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,250
Take out the cake,

131
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,590
Light the candles, I'll bring a knife.

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,600
Why are you doing all of this?

133
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,090
You're insulting me, aren't you?

134
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,830
What are you saying, mate!

135
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,820
It's the wish of a crazed lover.

136
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,370
Please, fulfil it.

137
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,007
Stay here for a while now that you've stopped.

138
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,087
Take out the cake.

139
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,868
Take it out, will you?

140
00:09:30,868 --> 00:09:32,690
They say one should keep one's trust

141
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,646
They say one should keep one's trust even if there is no love.

142
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,502
One more request...

143
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,596
Yes?

144
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:11,990
You'd keep smiling while the cake is cut.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,680
Okay.

146
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,360
I'll go and change.

147
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,639
Danish, give me my phone.

148
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:27,992
I've never stayed up at night. I sleep even in sorrow. But I'm up tonight; I don't know why I don't feel sleepy at all... Or is it that I'm waiting for it to be 9 a.m.?

149
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,030
Just one minute left.

150
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,111
So, light the candles, will you?

151
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,030
Happy anniversary.

152
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,806
Happy anniversary.

153
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:59,157
May you always remain happy.

154
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,670
Why don't you have something?

155
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,510
I'm starving right now.

156
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,826
I'll take it out.

157
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,800
Tell me where you keep everything before you leave.

158
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,980
Boot polish,

159
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,300
Brush...

160
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,960
Where you keep the laundry after washing,

161
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,610
And where you keep them after they're dry.

162
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,940
Don't you know?

163
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,540
I do, but...

164
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,316
I don't remember.

165
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,420
You remember, don't you,

166
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,650
That I even forget

167
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:22,270
Where I've kept the thread and needle.

168
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,880
I do remember the things in the kitchen.

169
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,346
I go there every now and then.

170
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:33,627
I don't remember anything else.

171
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,420
I think you hang the clothes out in the balcony to dry, don't you?

172
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,816
Yes.

173
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:46,316
And Rumi's clothes?

174
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:49,950
They're in the cabinet in his room.

175
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,513
Toys

176
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,946
And all...

177
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,556
And the spare keys?

178
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,910
I'll give those to you before I leave.

179
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,816
I don't really need them...

180
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,627
But you know, I'm rather forgetful.

181
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:20,907
They'd be useful if I forgot one somewhere.

182
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:26,028
Rumi has milk in a glass, now, doesn't he?

183
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,449
Don't tell me you forgot that, too!

184
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,480
Honestly?

185
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,410
I never remembered anything except you,

186
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,990
Thinking

187
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,149
That you'd remember everything else.

188
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,200
Ah, the aroma!

189
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,016
I'm starving! Why don't you have something?

190
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,816
Your phone's ringing.

191
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,940
Not mine; it's yours.

192
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,347
Oh.

193
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,638
It's mine...

194
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,578
Mr Matin!

195
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:24,598
He's started loving me, too!

196
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:26,710
Hello, Mr Matin!

197
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,654
Happy wedding anniversary!

198
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:34,010
Thank you. How did you find out?

199
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,500
I was surprised to hear it when you were telling someone else last year.

200
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,410
That's when I'd befriended you.

201
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,100
Today used to be my wedding anniversary too.

202
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,350
Oh...

203
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,090
Surely, your injuries are alright by now?

204
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,610
Yes.

205
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,710
They're better.

206
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,620
So, aren't you coming tomorrow?

207
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,770
I would, Mr Matin.

208
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,930
But I'd be a bit late,

209
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,530
Around 10?

210
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,790
It's enough that you'd be coming.

211
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,590
Take care.

212
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,880
Likewise.

213
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,466
Goodbye.

214
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,142
Mehwish!

215
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,348
It was our wedding anniversary today.

216
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,810
He was celebrating it.

217
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,640
He was celebrating it.
-What?

218
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,160
Don't tell me the two of you cut a cake too!

219
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,710
Of course.

220
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,430
He'd brought a cake.

221
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,680
I didn't even remember... He asked me to cut the cake when he'd brought it.

222
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,636
I thought, 'Alright, let's do it'.

223
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,976
This man's round the twist.

224
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:11,330
I felt so many times, too.

225
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,800
How would you live with that mad man?

226
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,866
There's still 8 and a half hours left.

227
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,891
Please, just come over, will you?

228
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,606
Me?

229
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:25,076
Ask him if he will allow me.

230
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,590
Please, come. I'm afraid of him.

231
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,740
I said...

232
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,536
I said... Ask him.

233
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,916
Okay.

234
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,420
C'mon, mate. Your food's getting cold.

235
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,917
I suppose he's unable to sleep.

236
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,250
That's just how one feels

237
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:33,619
When his girlfriend's with someone else.

238
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,700
Just think

239
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,650
How I would've felt the night

240
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,729
He'd taken you to Islamabad?

241
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,039
It was my wife, mate...

242
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,240
The thing is...

243
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,946
He wants to come.

244
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,166
Here?

245
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,680
The bugger must be itching to come here.

246
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,010
But what'd he do here?

247
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,012
He'd just sit around like a weed among the roses.

248
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:17,346
Alright...

249
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:20,090
Call him.

250
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,892
But ask him not to ring the bell.

251
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,126
Okay.

252
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:31,956
Hey!

253
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:34,300
Sit here and talk.

254
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,227
What's with the shame now?

255
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,350
He refused, didn't he?

256
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,990
No.

257
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,790
You can come now.

258
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,690
Sure?

259
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,860
Sure.

260
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,075
Okay, I'm coming.

261
00:23:11,075 --> 00:23:14,465
Just 20 minutes.

262
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,060
Look back.

263
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,690
Have I ever turned you down?

264
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,592
How could I turn you down today?

265
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,680
Then, rouse them.

266
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,390
Tell them that we're having an important guest.

267
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,070
The room should be in order when I come back.

268
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,110
There shouldn't be a single cigarette stub around.

269
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,820
Take my packet away, too.

270
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
When would you be back?

271
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,511
By the morning.

272
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,500
What are you doing?

273
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,350
Cleaning up.

274
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,710
The house is a small one,

275
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,480
But one's got to maintain his image, mate.

276
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,270
The thing is, I'm poor,

277
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,951
The thing is, I'm poor, but I ain't dirty.

278
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:29,689
Here.

279
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:32,150
I'll do it.
-Hey!

280
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,520
Who works just before bidding farewell?
[Rukhsati = ritual of sending the woman off with her husband]

281
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,990
Sit down.
[Rukhsati = ritual of sending the woman off with her husband]

282
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,850
I'd be doing all of this.

283
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,926
I could as well start now.

284
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,139
Hey!

285
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,430
Sit down, will you?

286
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,790
Sit down, mate, sit.

287
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,046
Over here.

288
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,100
When will he get here?

289
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,380
He said about 20 minutes.

290
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,930
That means he'd be here in 10 minutes.

291
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,836
I'll put some water on.

292
00:25:18,836 --> 00:25:21,880
I'll prepare the tea, Danish.

293
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,090
Why, mate?

294
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,690
Why would you?

295
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,870
Who'd prepare the tea tomorrow morning?

296
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,820
Who'd prepare the tea tomorrow morning? Tomorrow night?

297
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,310
I would, of course.

298
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,340
So, I would this time, too.

299
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,900
So, I would this time, too. And you'll see

300
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,950
That I'll make it nice and strong.

301
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,536
Your hand's bleeding.

302
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,826
Goodness...

303
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:45,830
Over here. I'll bandage you.

304
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:50,510
Isn't it enough that you've given me these wounds?

305
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,980
I have the bandages. I'll put them on.

306
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,640
What is it?

307
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,189
50 million.

308
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,726
They're divorce papers, mate.

309
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:12,560
I swear, they're divorce papers.

310
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,566
You may check.

311
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,640
Quickly, now, keep them in your bag.

312
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,283
He'd be here any moment.

313
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,127
Sorry -- I forgot to tell him...

314
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:39,329
Hi!

315
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:41,220
May I come in?

316
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,501
Please, come in, Mr Shehwar.

317
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,770
What happened to your head?

318
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,250
Had an accident.

319
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,310
We bikers have trifling accidents now and then.

320
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,230
Come.

321
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,190
Sit.

322
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:02,845
I'll get you some tea.

323
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,646
Here.

324
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,167
I'll pour.
-No.

325
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,636
Don't pour.

326
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:59,707
I won't have it if you did.

327
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,020
Sugar?

328
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,290
One teaspoon.

329
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,396
Thank you.

330
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,896
Sugar?

331
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:21,456
I won't have tea.

332
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:24,896
You'd have to.

333
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,220
You know I don't take sugar.

334
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,477
Ah, right...

335
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:38,358
I'd known that.

336
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,770
Know what, Mr Shehwar,

337
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,660
Back when I loved her,

338
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,920
And <i>she loved me</i>,

339
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,200
I rose up to 6 feet,

340
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,090
I was a bit stiff-necked.

341
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,430
What it is is

342
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,460
When his wife is loyal,

343
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,500
A man stands proud and tall.

344
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,110
Like this.

345
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,570
But, Mr Shehwar...

346
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,936
I've fallen in stature.

347
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,440
Of late, I've been feeling

348
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,570
That I'm no more than a mouse.

349
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:40,120
Anybody could trample me underfoot.

350
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,450
The relationship between a man and a woman is strange, Mr Shehwar.

351
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,560
As long as she's only got eyes for you,

352
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,490
She raises you to godliness;

353
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:58,786
The moment she turns her gaze away, she separates you from God.

354
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,320
I can understand your sorrow, Mr Danish,

355
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,980
But the times have changed now.

356
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,020
It happens.

357
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,860
Women realise after getting into it

358
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,230
That their old love was a wrong decision.

359
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,060
At such moments, men like us should help them,

360
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,186
And bid them farewell like you are.
[Rukhsat = sending the bride off with her husband]

361
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:26,840
But of course, I'm bidding her farewell.
[Rukhsat = sending the bride off with her husband]

362
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,780
I've divorced her.

363
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,010
That's great.

364
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,080
Don't say that, Mr Shehwar.

365
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,440
I'd feel

366
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,100
That 'great'

367
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,510
Is a bland word we throw around just about anywhere.

368
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,490
Plundering someone's life-savings

369
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,140
From the rubble of his home...

370
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,476
Surely, that can't be 'great'.

371
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:08,050
I'm going to the room.
-How can you go to the room?

372
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,836
I've handed you the order of your release from that room.

373
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:15,806
You can't go in there.

374
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,016
So, what was I saying, Mr Shehwar?

375
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:24,820
I don't know... You were saying <i>something</i>...

376
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,136
I don't know... You were saying <i>something</i>...
-Yes!

377
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:28,270
You were saying that men should help

378
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:32,600
Those women who want to escape the shackles of love,

379
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,350
Those who realise later on

380
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,370
That they'd made a mistake.

381
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,980
So, remember, Mr Shehwar,

382
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,191
I've helped.

383
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,760
I've packed her things too.

384
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,236
Just a moment.

385
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,711
Here's the bag.

386
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,540
Nothing that's hers is left...

387
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,646
Nothing that's hers is left... Except Rumi.

388
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,120
I would've liked it if you'd had tea, Mr Shehwar.

389
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,530
No, thank you.

390
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,930
You won't have tea either?

391
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,720
No.

392
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,760
Then, get going. Why are you standing here?

393
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,681
Then, get going. Why are you standing here?
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

394
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:31,191
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

395
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:36,540
<i>Of forgetting as you leave;</i>

396
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,950
Come, I'll leave you at the door.

397
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,110
Come, I'll leave you at the door.
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

398
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,450
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

399
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:45,360
Come.
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

400
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:51,390
<i>From my life, now that you're leaving.</i>

401
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,740
Please, Mr Shehwar, come.

402
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,770
What does it matter if it's 9 a.m. or 2 a.m.?

403
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,241
What does it matter if it's 9 a.m. or 2 a.m.?
<i>As nothing more than a formality, if nothing else,</i>

404
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:03,250
<i>As nothing more than a formality, if nothing else,</i>

405
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:11,130
<i>Turn back and glance at me for a moment;</i>

406
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,041
Goodbye.
<i>Fulfil the vows of our bond for once</i>

407
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:17,907
<i>Fulfil the vows of our bond for once</i>

408
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:23,687
<i>As you break it.</i>

409
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:28,450
You seem to be a rather intelligent businessman,

410
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:34,040
But you surprised me when dealing here.

411
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,570
You were offering me 50 million

412
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,470
For a woman who's not even worth spare change.

413
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,481
For a woman who's not even worth spare change.
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

414
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:42,250
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

415
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:47,590
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

416
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,426
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

417
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:53,117
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

418
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,918
<i>Bless you with this parting,</i>

419
00:35:55,918 --> 00:36:02,029
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

420
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:07,430
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

421
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,520
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

422
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,480
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

423
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,120
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

424
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:50,660
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

425
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:55,840
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

426
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,550
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

427
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:03,966
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

428
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:06,706
<i>What does it matter, if I don't have</i>

429
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:12,157
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

430
00:37:12,157 --> 00:37:14,997
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

431
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:20,318
<i>That I had you;</i>

432
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,140
<i>But, from you, I have learnt</i>

433
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,890
<i>That, even in love,</i>

434
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,620
<i>One could rather betray</i>

435
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,380
<i>One could rather repulse.</i>

436
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,490
<i>It was just yesterday</i>

437
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,240
<i>That your hand was in mine,</i>

438
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,296
<i>And your heart beat in mine;</i>

439
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,140
<i>These ebrious eyes</i>

440
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,560
<i>That have altered beyond recognition -</i>

441
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,810
<i>There was a time when I was their ardent devotee.</i>

442
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:42,220
<i>Should you chance upon me somewhere,</i>

443
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:49,580
<i>Surreptitiously, turn your gaze the other way, and move away.</i>

444
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,376
<i>I have to live out my days</i>

445
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,300
<i>Without you</i>

446
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,790
<i>I have to live out my days</i>

447
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,466
<i>Without you</i>

448
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:12,480
<i>I am destined, now, to live out my days without you.</i>

449
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,000
English translation: J. Mir
<i>I am destined, now, to live out my days without you.</i>
