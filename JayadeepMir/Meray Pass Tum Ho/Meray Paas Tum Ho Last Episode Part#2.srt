1
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,200
You look so calm.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,830
Have your tea.

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,730
I hear you've gotten married?
-Yes.

4
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,170
You didn't even invite me.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,440
You wouldn't have come.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,724
Why?

7
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:31,831
You know...

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,840
I'd punched you and all...

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,296
So you'd punched me, too...

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,380
I'd taken so many punches back then that I can't even remember

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,960
That you'd punched me, too.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,426
It's okay.

13
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,390
You punched me, I took it...

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,630
We're even.

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,900
We're not even, Danish.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,670
I'm in your debt.

17
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:00,340
You've changed a lot.

18
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,790
It seems you've got a nice wife.

19
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,736
Very nice.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,960
And <i>she</i>'s bought the flat. She's living there now.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,580
I would've been delighted to meet you if you hadn't told me that...

22
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,096
I had to tell you, Danish.

23
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:26,686
She's put up a plaque reading 'Akhtar Ahmed'.

24
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,136
Please, come someday.

25
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:30,037
You'd be surprised.

26
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:32,940
The building has a new feel to it.

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,626
I lower my gaze when I see her.

28
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:38,316
I call her my sister when I talk to her;

29
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:42,717
I even said, 'Brothers can do anything for their sisters.'

30
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:47,767
She's been with my wife all day, praying.

31
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:50,887
She's looking for rites to perform.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,916
My wife told me about one -

33
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:57,250
If she read it 7 times, blew over a glass of water thrice,

34
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,786
And drank the water,

35
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,656
You'd come.

36
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:04,247
You have to meet her.

37
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,370
She said to me, 'You've done so much for your sister',

38
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,156
'Please, go and ask him to come and meet me once.'

39
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:14,163
Just once.

40
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,240
I knew right then that she'd set me a difficult task.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,056
But I made a promise to her.

42
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,650
I thought

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,840
That the worst that can happen is you saying, 'I'm not going'.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,110
I'm not going, Monty.

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,380
That's alright,

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,389
And I knew you wouldn't come if I <i>just</i> asked.

47
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,199
But what about that rite?

48
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,020
She would've blown over the water and drunk all of it.

49
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,240
What about that, Danish?

50
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,906
Would you rather stand against the Lord's words?

51
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,788
You're scaring me?

52
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:56,680
No, Danish. There's nothing to get scared about.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,280
There are many in the city who don't believe in the power of such rites.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,776
Don't worry.

55
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,550
Nothing can happen to you.

56
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,390
Nothing can happen to her, either.

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,016
But something does happen to one

58
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,460
Who's seen her perform the rite in such pain.

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,361
One stops in his tracks to wonder...

60
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,347
I've had my tea.

61
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:34,196
I can swear to her that I'd met you.

62
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,080
And asked you to come.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,937
Threatened you with rites, too.

64
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:45,705
But you didn't give in.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,366
Which is why you didn't come.

66
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,381
Please, forget the punch,

67
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:05,177
Or hit back with one if you still remember it.

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,386
And then?

69
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,353
What else...

70
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:40,133
His tea had gotten cold.

71
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,833
He drank it all in one sip,

72
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:45,190
Shook hands, and said --
-You've told me about that...

73
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,500
Tell me what <i>you</i> said.

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,866
What could I say?

75
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,206
I was scared.

76
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,517
Hmm...

77
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,226
'Hmm', what?

78
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,337
When are you going?

79
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:06,037
Where?

80
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:08,207
To meet her.

81
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:11,581
When did I say I'm going?

82
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,651
I won't.

83
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:17,496
Why did you say, 'I was scared'?

84
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:19,177
I mean --

85
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,436
Sort of...

86
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,791
I -- was a bit scared, but --

87
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,179
I -- was a bit scared, but --
-When one does get scared,

88
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,277
One doesn't get just <i>a bit</i> scared.

89
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,947
He's utterly scared.

90
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:35,059
He just says, 'I was <i>a bit</i> scared', so to speak.

91
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,298
Are you sure?

92
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,347
Yeah.

93
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,256
Hmm...

94
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:45,014
'Hmm', what?

95
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,476
I'm utterly scared.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,346
So, when are you going?

97
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,957
Shall we?

98
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,656
Don't go there alone.

99
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,110
Some <i>dal halwa</i> for you!

100
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,066
My first try at it.

101
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,970
I thought I'd treat you to it,

102
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,266
And, if you liked it, Monty.

103
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,456
Otherwise...

104
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,106
So I'm your taster, eh?

105
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,713
You'd try it on me before serving your husband?

106
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,246
Splendid.

107
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:40,837
Come.

108
00:07:43,776 --> 00:07:46,506
<i>He</i> loved it too.

109
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,977
But I didn't know how to make it.

110
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:53,586
I've learnt only now.

111
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:56,900
Why didn't you learn back then?

112
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,281
I'd learnt to two-time back then.

113
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,380
If you're devoted to two-timing, you can't learn to cook for the loyal.

114
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:10,873
Please, sit.

115
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:13,031
I'll get you some tea.

116
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,790
I've longed to live today after months.

117
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,210
Monty came and told me that he may be coming,

118
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,536
And I took his word for it.

119
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,016
Since then,

120
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:39,136
I've been living heartily.

121
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:41,420
And

122
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,447
What if he didn't come?

123
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,980
I know he won't.

124
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,647
He considers the unfaithful as sinners,

125
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:58,384
And Dad would pay him a visit in his dreams if he thought about meeting a sinner.

126
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,667
Hi, handsome!

127
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,397
Hi.

128
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,371
Going somewhere?

129
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,722
Yes.

130
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:22,241
To Miss Hania's?

131
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:23,412
No.

132
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:25,532
To your Maman's.

133
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,745
Really?

134
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,226
Wow!

135
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:34,536
She wouldn't let you come back if you went looking so dashing.

136
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,667
That's what worries me, too.

137
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,730
I feel that I may not be able to come back if I went there.

138
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,436
Don't think about me.

139
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:49,226
I'm waiting two hours and coming there with the driver.

140
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,086
And take the ring off. She'd ask if she saw it!

141
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:58,976
Put it on when you're back.

142
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,396
Keep it with you.

143
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,253
You're fully in the mood, mate.

144
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,546
Do I look dashing?

145
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:16,936
Yes.

146
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:18,966
Alright, go now.

147
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,067
I'll change.

148
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,337
Okay?

149
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,770
Hey --

150
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,391
I was just coming your way!

151
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,876
He's coming, Monty!

152
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,440
Ask Ifrah to chant an incantation

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,476
To stop him from ever going back.

154
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,028
You'll ask her, won't you?

155
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,076
Alright,

156
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,006
I'll get ready -- Yeah --

157
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:07,967
Ask Ifrah to come. I'd need her help.

158
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:38,446
Come to me after two hours.

159
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,141
You don't feel like going, do you?

160
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:45,073
I don't.

161
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:48,721
But I've decided to go.

162
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,760
Because it'd delight both of you.

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,586
What about Miss Hania?

164
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,460
Don't worry.

165
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,970
Men are rather famously

166
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,846
Natural two-timers.

167
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,156
My Papa can't be a two-timer.

168
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:06,240
A compliment?

169
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,836
Yeah.

170
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:08,770
Shall I?

171
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,236
Yes.

172
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,566
Wait, Papa...

173
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,040
Take care, mate.

174
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,816
I can see you don't want to go.

175
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:37,930
I don't want you to go either.

176
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,050
But Maman...

177
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:45,155
She's my weakness...

178
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,436
There yet?

179
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:20,690
No. He's left.

180
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,707
He'd be there by the time we're done talking.

181
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:25,586
Is his heart a bit worried?

182
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:26,510
Yeah...

183
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,528
Same here.

184
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:30,556
Same here.

185
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,660
I know.

186
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,070
That's why I've called you.

187
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,456
May I ask something, teacher?

188
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:38,550
Sure.

189
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,550
Do those who go to 'meet' like this ever not come back?

190
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,630
That's what Papa was saying.

191
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,156
He said, 'Come to me if I'm not back in two hours.'

192
00:13:57,156 --> 00:14:00,746
Tell me, teacher, is it possible?

193
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,676
Yes...

194
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,936
It's possible.

195
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,166
L --

196
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,637
Listen...

197
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,370
Would you be coming to school tomorrow if it happened?

198
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,990
I will, sure.

199
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,990
Then, bring my ring back from Papa.

200
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,776
Going somewhere?

201
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,367
Yes.

202
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,186
Where?

203
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:43,936
Back to the home

204
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:47,567
Where I'd sprung up to here from.

205
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:53,260
Know what, Maham,

206
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,540
The likes of me cannot digest it

207
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,476
When they get respect out of turn

208
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:03,246
And vomit it all out.

209
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,646
Let me clean it now.

210
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,823
So,

211
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:16,374
You're taking <i>just</i> that?

212
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:20,503
I'm even ashamed to take this.

213
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:25,489
Something in it may be yours.

214
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,250
Could you check

215
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,882
If there's nothing of any worth in it?

216
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,386
It was the faith that was priceless, Shehwar,

217
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:41,886
That love, that trust,

218
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:46,700
That vanished with the slightest hint of betrayal.

219
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,157
Priceless goods cheapen

220
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,700
Where there's no love.

221
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,186
I want to apologise to you again.

222
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:01,920
But apologies won't quite do.

223
00:16:03,002 --> 00:16:05,152
Divorce me.

224
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,946
No.

225
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,386
If I divorced you, I'd feel that I've still got the power.

226
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,173
No...

227
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:20,130
I wish I could say that an unfaithful man

228
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,306
Shouldn't even have the power to divorce someone.

229
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,327
<i>You</i> file for divorce.

230
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,547
I give you the right to divorce me.

231
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,026
May I leave now?

232
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,046
Sure.

233
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,276
Bye.

234
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,956
Bye.

235
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,896
Wait.

236
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,046
Would you resign from the job?

237
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,570
No.

238
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,557
Fire me.

239
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,430
I'll work hard

240
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,340
As long as I'm on the job.

241
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,640
Should I drop you?

242
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,256
No.

243
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,970
I've booked a car.

244
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,336
Paying for a cab after years

245
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,997
Would remind me of my true place.

246
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:42,796
Sorry.

247
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:46,935
I've bothered you a lot.

248
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:50,325
No.

249
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:53,995
I've given you too much grief.

250
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,956
You thought I'd never forgive you.

251
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:04,326
I was afraid that you might forgive me.

252
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,310
Thank goodness

253
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,546
That we don't have a Rumi.

254
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,500
It's just you that I've ruined,

255
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,886
Or myself.

256
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:24,440
You've ruined Mehwish, Shehwar Ahmed,

257
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,864
And Danish.

258
00:18:26,864 --> 00:18:29,810
I will never admit that.

259
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,260
No man ruins a woman like <i>her</i>.

260
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,680
The courage to destroy her own household is within her.

261
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,060
Dreams too big for her eyes do.

262
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,000
Such women don't see

263
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,120
What they've got.

264
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,590
All they see is what the others have got.

265
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,480
Such women are blind

266
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,010
And anyone can lead them astray in the name of helping them.

267
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,557
One doesn't have to be a Shehwar Ahmed to do that.

268
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,290
And yes,

269
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,350
If you ever meet Danish Akhtar, ask him to thank me.

270
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,760
I've shown him

271
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,900
That if a wife's got the option of another man,

272
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,196
The husband's got nothing.

273
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,797
Wait.

274
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,910
I'd gone to meet Mehwish once.

275
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,030
I gave her her money and said,

276
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,740
'I can give you the money',

277
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,586
'But not Shehwar.'

278
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,986
Tell me - why did I say that?

279
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,660
Tell me.

280
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,460
No idea.

281
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,630
I don't know either.

282
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,717
It just occurred to me.

283
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,420
Or maybe we're just that way.

284
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,820
Our Shehwar Ahmed

285
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,100
May be as unfaithful and stone-hearted as you,

286
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,020
Yet, we hold on to him.

287
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,011
We never give him to anyone.

288
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,740
Think carefully before going -

289
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,700
You're not getting the chairmanship back.

290
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,460
I can give you a car to go to the office.

291
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,290
You can even get a promotion.

292
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,446
I'll even take back the condition about the tiffin.

293
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,901
But I won't forgive you.

294
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,951
One more thing.

295
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:11,691
If you still want to leave, just go.

296
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:16,620
But remember -

297
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,381
I'll be filing divorce papers in the morning

298
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,041
And firing you by the evening.

299
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,006
Why are you trembling?

300
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,236
What do you think?

301
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,996
She'd seize his hand and take him along?

302
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:46,006
I was learning

303
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,626
That one should love like you.

304
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:51,187
Love with such loyalty

305
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:53,010
And pride

306
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,661
Made love seem something worthwhile.

307
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:58,468
But looking at you now,

308
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:00,518
I'm worried.

309
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,230
You're jealous

310
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,630
That he's meeting her?

311
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,946
Do you feel she could snatch him from you now that he's meeting her?

312
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:14,586
I'm not jealous.

313
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:20,260
Now that he's meeting her, talking to her,

314
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,006
It doesn't feel that she could snatch him from me.

315
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,210
I feel that he'd be snatched from me.

316
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
