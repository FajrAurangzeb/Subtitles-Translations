1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,150
Hello!
-Hi!

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,040
How are are you?

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,430
Fine!

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,480
What should we order?

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,070
What do you say?

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,270
Alright.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,417
Is this spicy garlic fish any good?

8
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,096
I'll be back. Excuse me.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,491
Hi.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,976
Hi.

11
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,300
May I sit?

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,556
Yeah, sure.

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,746
You -- here...

14
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,226
You're here too.

15
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,320
What are you doing?

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,630
I'm here to have dinner.

17
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,310
You have your dinner at the bistro.

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,920
That's quite the change, mate.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,116
Are you on a date?

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,110
Sorry.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,450
I get quite personal with you because of Dad.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,556
I hope you didn't mind it.

23
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,307
Not at all.

24
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,236
And I'm not on a date.

25
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:36,590
I just felt like going somewhere nice to have dinner.

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,860
So --

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,180
What about you?

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,200
Is everything good?

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,290
Is Rumi fine?

30
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,480
Absolutely fine.

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,771
He said to me, 'Tell Papa to get married'.

32
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,510
What'd you like to have?

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,380
I've already ordered.

34
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,160
No -- I'm here with my friends. I won't have anything.

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,667
Seeing you, I thought you'd be caught red-handed today.

36
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,967
I just felt so.

37
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:11,050
You don't really listen to the thing about marriage.

38
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,790
Know what, Rumi's found a match for you.

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,870
Says she's very cute.

40
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,676
Looks good with you.

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,680
When did you

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,110
When did you start smiling like that?

43
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,250
Do you know what that smile means?

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,510
That the person before you is saying a load of pure guff.

45
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,967
No.

46
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,020
It's not like that.

47
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,390
Then, get married, will you?

48
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,020
I won't get married.

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,230
There!

50
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,440
That's what he says, too.

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,390
'Dad won't agree to get married'.

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,590
Alright, just see her for once.

53
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,876
Who knows, she may begin to grow on you.

54
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,827
Pl --

55
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:23,340
Please don't go just yet.

56
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,850
I was going to my friends --

57
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,100
I was going to my friends --
-Just for a while.

58
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,237
I was going to my friends --
-Just for a while. Please.

59
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,166
My --

60
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,210
My heart's thumping really fast.

61
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,386
Okay...

62
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:47,237
Relax. I'm right here.

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,680
Ours was a love marriage.

64
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,690
A rather famous kind of love marriage.

65
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,200
And would you look at it now!

66
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,710
Both the love and the marriage

67
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,936
Have been scotched.

68
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,780
What are love and marriage, exactly?

69
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,990
I mean, can one love and marry

70
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,597
Just about anyone, just like that?

71
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,120
My heartbeat's fine now.

72
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,351
I'm okay now.

73
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,821
And thank you very much.

74
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,610
You may go.

75
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,930
Please go and

76
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,816
Have fun with your friends.

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,110
Sure?

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,090
Yes.

79
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,931
Absolutely.

80
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,551
Bye.

81
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,300
Bye.

82
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,851
You're still thinking about him, right?

83
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,622
Yes...

84
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,360
Why did he get up and leave?

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,280
He didn't even have his dinner.

86
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,900
His heart had start thumping really fast; he was sweating.

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,400
He should've gone to a doctor!

88
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,370
He should just have gotten up and left.

89
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,890
Why?

90
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,661
Because Mehwish had come right in front of him with her new boyfriend.

91
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,190
Mehwish?

92
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,110
Why didn't you tell me?

93
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,700
I wanted to see her.

94
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,460
He's really become something of a friend of yours.

95
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,050
Told you that his heart's pounding,

96
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,200
That he's sweating.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,470
He doesn't realise what he's saying when he's frightened.

98
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,230
Something dangerous is about to happen.

99
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,800
What?

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,566
Love.

101
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,866
He curses love.

102
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,570
What about you?

103
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,456
You've never cursed.

104
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:08,520
After what I've seen today,

105
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,720
I feel that way too.

106
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,346
To curse anyone who talks of love so badly...

107
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,960
I pity him.

108
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,560
You would, too.

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,966
And you can't love those you pity.

110
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,620
I just want him to be happy.

111
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,486
Dad would like it this way, too, wouldn't he?

112
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:40,976
He always wanted to see him smile brightly.

113
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,766
Yes, an omelette would do, too. And a <i>chapatti</i> with that.

114
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,510
It'll do without one. I'll have two slices of bread, then.

115
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,878
And a cup of tea.

116
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,257
Thank you.

117
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,567
Yeah, I'll be waiting.

118
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,740
Hi.

119
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,190
You bugger!

120
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,280
Do you know what Shehwar Chemicals has closed at?

121
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,450
Don't tell me just yet.

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,160
I'll ask you on Monday.

123
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,930
Are you absolute nuts?

124
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,011
If I told you I am, would you rest at that?

125
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,250
Honestly?

126
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,400
When people rob you of everything, be happy.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,910
Just think that the Lord is about to give you everything.

128
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,930
Anyway -- come over for dinner tomorrow.

129
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,060
Ayesha was crying when she found out about your divorce.

130
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,720
She wants to meet you.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,936
Please, come over, boyo.

132
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:06,077
She's learnt to cook, too.

133
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:08,230
Alright, I'll come for dinner.

134
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,700
But please tell her to not shed tears before me.

135
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,440
I'd seen Mehwish today.

136
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,830
She's very happy.

137
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,400
And if she's so happy after the divorce,

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,620
Why are we crying?

139
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,830
Just pray for her.

140
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,281
May she remain happy.

141
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,560
Text me your address.

142
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,027
I'll be there tomorrow.

143
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,342
Bye.

144
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:35,852
Okay.

145
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:59,081
As if someone's tripped and fallen in water, but not quite drowning yet...

146
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,960
Call him.

147
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,740
Why?

148
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Ask him if he's had dinner,

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,680
And if he has,

150
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,180
It means he doesn't need any sympathies or pity.

151
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,060
He's just looking for someone he can trust to love.

152
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,731
I don't love him.

153
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:23,210
Do you want it in writing?

154
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,061
Alright.

155
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,281
Just call him, will you?

156
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,540
Ask him

157
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,677
If he's had dinner.

158
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:33,960
Just ask indirectly.

159
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,226
Mention Dad.

160
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,370
Turn on the speaker.

161
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,430
Hello?

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,210
Yes, Mr Danish,

163
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,470
How are you?

164
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,956
Fine.

165
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,436
Have you had your dinner?

166
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:55,780
You didn't have anything at the restaurant.

167
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,850
I felt so hungry the moment I got to the guest house that I had dinner immediately.

168
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,966
You live in a guest house?

169
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:02,990
Yes.

170
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,281
I'm here for a few days before shifting to my home.

171
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,496
May I tell you something?

172
00:11:11,966 --> 00:11:13,637
Yes?

173
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,081
You notice me just like Mr Matin.

174
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,876
Innit?

175
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,620
100%.

176
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,167
He'd even notice that I didn't quite smile while talking.

177
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,810
Just think that

178
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,290
I notice because he used to.

179
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,480
I know.

180
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,026
You've read his diary, haven't you?

181
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,280
Yes.

182
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,590
Thank you so much.

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,820
Thank you.

184
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,980
Take care.

185
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,450
Likewise.

186
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,610
Good night.

187
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,447
Good night.

188
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,996
Mind if

189
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:57,267
Mind if I told you something?

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:04,120
I've lost a lot because of Mr Danish,

191
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,920
And perhaps you will, too.

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,796
How?

193
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:15,370
I can now believe that there are men like that.

194
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,887
Now, I'll be left looking

195
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,280
For a man like him.

196
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,110
Why do you need to look for one?

197
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,560
You've got one right before you.

198
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,430
Give him his life back.

199
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,883
Shut up, Watira.

200
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,880
Promise me.

201
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,630
If he said it himself,

202
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,290
Just accept it.

203
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,571
Don't say,

204
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:40,742
Don't say, 'I pity you'.

205
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,961
I'm the one who's at loss here.

206
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:51,130
I, too, can believe that there are men like that.

207
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,761
I'd be left looking for one...

208
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:16,726
Just wait here.

209
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:17,780
Alright.

210
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,970
I'll be back.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,626
Please, wait here.

212
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,340
Excuse me, sir.

213
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,820
Over here.

214
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,390
How much does this black car cost?

215
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,106
3.4 million, sir.

216
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,670
3.4 million?

217
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,586
Just a second.

218
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,896
It's at 52.80.

219
00:13:53,896 --> 00:13:55,560
Sell a hundred thousand.

220
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
Just a hundred thousand?

221
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,950
I'm selling them at a loss.

222
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,397
Sell them quickly, and send --

223
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,980
What's the name of your showroom?

224
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,096
[BLEEP]

225
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,660
The money to [BLEEP] showroom.

226
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,420
What are you doing there?

227
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,430
Buying a car.

228
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,906
Are you there right now?

229
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,560
Yes.

230
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,660
Look for Gohar over there.

231
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,520
Gohar --

232
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,010
Is there a Mr Gohar around here?

233
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,146
I'll call him here.

234
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,277
Please.

235
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,798
Just a minute.

236
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,906
Good morning, sir.

237
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,520
Good morning.

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,927
Please talk to him, Mr Gohar...

239
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,407
Yes?

240
00:14:34,797 --> 00:14:37,957
Salman! How are you, ol' fellow?

241
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,990
Alright.

242
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,050
Right...

243
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,651
It's done, right?

244
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,527
I'll tell him.

245
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm giving you a discount of 50,000, sir.

246
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,320
Thank you.

247
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,130
Welcome.

248
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,471
Over here.

249
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,516
Waqas! Prepare an invoice.

250
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,567
Oh --

251
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,390
Whose car is this, Mr Danish?

252
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,980
It's mine, Mr Jameel. I've just bought it!

253
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,331
Splendid, sir!

254
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,086
So quickly!

255
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,836
That's brilliant.

256
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:37,830
What about this bike, Mr Danish?

257
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,951
Please park it on the porch of the house I've just bought.

258
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:44,021
I'm coming right away. I'll give you the money, too.

259
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,111
Alright.

260
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,272
Where is it?

261
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,567
Inside the car.

262
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,190
Which car?

263
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,947
What do you see here?

264
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,697
You've brought a car, Papa?

265
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,496
Whose is it?

266
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:23,789
Yours.

267
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:26,163
Haha. Good joke.

268
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:27,379
It's not a joke.

269
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,199
It's your car, Rumi.

270
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,330
Really?

271
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,730
Yes.

272
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,646
It's nice, innit?

273
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,336
Very nice.

274
00:16:37,336 --> 00:16:38,806
Sit.

275
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,308
Where are we going?

276
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,300
We're going home.

277
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,800
Thank you, Papa, I love you.

278
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,590
I love you too.

279
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,347
Fasten your seatbelts; a nice ride awaits!

280
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:01,968
Ready?

281
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,202
Have you bought it, Papa?

282
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:23,180
No, I've rented it.

283
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,384
It's huge.

284
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,090
It's not huge, Rumi.

285
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,720
You feel this way because you've come out of the flat for the first time.

286
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,735
Let me show you your room. It's upstairs.

287
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:40,202
Come here.

288
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,061
Mr Danish!

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,175
This is Latif.

290
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:46,615
He's quite the cook.

291
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:49,490
I've brought the driver too. He's outside.

292
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,728
Alright.

293
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:52,260
Give the keys to him.

294
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,000
Please, prepare the day's meal.

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,859
Everything's in the kitchen.

296
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,960
Let me know when you've talked about their salaries.

297
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,943
Alright.

298
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,690
I'll show you the kitchen. Come.

299
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,170
Is this my room?

300
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,563
Have we gotten rich?

301
00:18:27,563 --> 00:18:29,042
Yeah...

302
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,796
How?

303
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,396
Bad question.

304
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,390
Look in the drawer.

305
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,583
The pink one.

306
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,839
For me?

307
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:46,026
Yeah.

308
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,649
Thank you.

309
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,960
Must be very costly.

310
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,330
You like it, don't you?

311
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,376
It's priceless now.

312
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,496
I hope it's not a dream.

313
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:59,266
It's not!

314
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,261
Alright.

315
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,050
I believe now it isn't a dream.

316
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,970
Wow...

317
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,021
That's quite the meal!

318
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,026
Hello?

319
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,430
It's 9.10.

320
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,326
Salman!

321
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,058
Where are you?

322
00:20:02,058 --> 00:20:03,997
Oh, mate, I almost forgot.

323
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:06,042
The thing is,

324
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:09,540
I'm with my son today. I thought I'd be with him today.

325
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,391
I brought him from the hostel, showed him the house,

326
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,996
And now we're having dinner.

327
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:17,816
I'm sorry, but I'd come on Sunday.

328
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,100
Alright.

329
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,187
But bring him along on Sunday too.

330
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,660
I will.

331
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,720
Promise.

332
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,180
Okay, bye.

333
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,826
Okay.

334
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,497
Alright.

335
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:34,088
In the name of the Lord, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

336
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,858
In the name of the Lord, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

337
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,170
Bon appétit!

338
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,440
Dinner's ready, sir.

339
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,520
So it is, but

340
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,776
Where's Mehwish?

341
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:14,167
She had her dinner in her room.

342
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,186
What do you mean?

343
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,067
Mehwish!

344
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,906
Mehwish!

345
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:43,338
Who is it?

346
00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:46,340
Who could it be, sweetheart?

347
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,630
The prisoner enchanted by your charm,

348
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,576
Your Romeo, madly in love with you...

349
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:55,880
What is it?

350
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,926
Splendid.

351
00:21:59,626 --> 00:22:02,277
What a question!

352
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,079
It's been two hours and I haven't seen you.

353
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,480
Come out,

354
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,160
And have mercy on these helpless eyes...

355
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,240
Tomorrow.

356
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,341
Tomorrow?

357
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:19,078
After the marriage?

358
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:21,330
I'm observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation] until then.

359
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,491
I'm observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation] until then. I won't meet you before that.

360
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:28,192
Observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation]...

361
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:30,944
Not meeting me...

362
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,100
Please don't laugh.

363
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,090
If you don't come out, I'd keep on laughing like this all night.

364
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,647
I won't.

365
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:45,376
I won't show you my face before tomorrow.

366
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:48,966
You'd get to see me when all the rituals are done and over with.

367
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,680
Go and sleep.

368
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,580
Or think what you'd give me [= ritualistic gift] when you see me.

369
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,767
You sound so serious about it.

370
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,548
Yes, Shehwar, I <i>am</i> serious.

371
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:03,710
We'll meet after the marriage tomorrow.

372
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,600
The marriage is in the evening, Mehwish...

373
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,290
Did I ask for it to be in the evening?

374
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,990
Alright, just open the door.

375
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,346
Didn't I say that the door's not opening?

376
00:23:14,346 --> 00:23:16,536
Mehwish...

377
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:18,906
Good night!

378
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,946
Eh?

379
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,150
'Observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation]'...

380
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,599
Well,

381
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,790
Well, I suppose I should, too...

382
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,766
Good night.

383
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,900
Have we gotten very rich?

384
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,768
Catch some sleep, mate.

385
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:56,670
Don't you see him in your dreams?

386
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,980
Who?

387
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,091
Grandpa.

388
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:01,556
I do.

389
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,386
Doesn't he scold you?

390
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,966
Why would he?

391
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,326
Nothing, really.

392
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:10,337
He used to before...

393
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,640
You can't sleep, can you?

394
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,662
Get up. Sit.

395
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,000
What do you think? Your Papa's earned these riches unfairly?

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,376
No.

397
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:27,420
I'd sold a flat worth 8 million,

398
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,360
And invested 7.8 million out of it.

399
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,876
I've earned a huge profit on it.

400
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:35,066
More than 35 million.

401
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,489
In just a few days?

402
00:24:37,489 --> 00:24:38,507
Yes.

403
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,420
In just a few days.

404
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,200
When He starts giving,

405
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,570
He gives everything in minutes.

406
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,624
Do you mean God?

407
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:46,726
Yes.

408
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:53,317
My teacher says that God doesn't let sorrows near you when He's happy with you.

409
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:54,476
Yes.

410
00:24:54,476 --> 00:24:55,816
She's right.

411
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:59,247
Won't you ask the teacher's name?

412
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,680
What's her name?

413
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,066
Miss Hania.

414
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:03,997
Alright.

415
00:25:03,997 --> 00:25:05,478
Now, catch some sleep.

416
00:25:05,478 --> 00:25:09,639
I will, but tell me, does my new phone work?

417
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,650
I've installed a new SIM card in your phone.

418
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,621
I've saved my number too.

419
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:16,180
Just yours?

420
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,761
Whose number do you want?

421
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:19,370
Miss Hania's.

422
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,890
She's also my friend.

423
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,800
Please give me her number too.

424
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,080
I don't have her number.

425
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,001
I have her father's.

426
00:25:28,001 --> 00:25:29,620
I just call that one.

427
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,075
So, give me that one.

428
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:35,396
Alright, old chap, I'll send you.

429
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,006
Where are you off to?

430
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,176
To my room.

431
00:25:41,176 --> 00:25:43,600
But you just said you won't be able to sleep alone?

432
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,206
I feel I may now.

433
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,626
I feel I may now.
-Little rascal!

434
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,650
Dad's phone is ringing.

435
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,196
Where is it?

436
00:26:01,196 --> 00:26:02,527
In my room.

437
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,696
Then -- Just see who it is.

438
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,380
Hello?

439
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,220
Okay.

440
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,646
It's Rumi.

441
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,826
Rumi?
-Yeah.

442
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:20,920
Hello?

443
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,927
Hello, teacher.

444
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:24,712
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

445
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:27,786
No, I don't feel sleepy right now.

446
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,646
Rumi...

447
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,860
And whose phone are you using right now?

448
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,910
Mine.

449
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,257
The warden would not spare you if he found out.

450
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,650
It's not funny, Rumi.

451
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,180
I swear it's funny, teacher.

452
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,860
I'm home now.

453
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,760
Papa's bought me a phone.

454
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,986
Splendid.

455
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:51,600
How did that happen?

456
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,350
We've gotten rich now.

457
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,780
Super rich.

458
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,780
Papa's bought a car too -- a big one. Black.

459
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,330
Has he bought a house too?

460
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,950
Yes, and it's huge!

461
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,656
Has your Papa hit a jackpot?

462
00:27:06,656 --> 00:27:09,630
Yes. He's changed completely.

463
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,497
Good for you.

464
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,248
But not good for Papa.

465
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:15,198
Why?

466
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:16,558
No idea why

467
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,059
But he's just busy with his numbers all the time.

468
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,782
He even sat down to put me to sleep.

469
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:24,333
He couldn't.

470
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,944
That's why I'm still awake.

471
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,454
It's 12, Rumi.

472
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,400
12.05.

473
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,236
It's time to sleep now.

474
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:39,846
Alright, teacher, I will.

475
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:43,380
Do you know, you're the first person I've called?

476
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,176
So sweet of you!

477
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:48,667
Please call Papa.

478
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,880
Why?

479
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,746
Didn't I tell you that thing about the girl?

480
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:55,809
Yes?

481
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,780
Just tell Papa to meet her once.

482
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,480
He should just see her once.

483
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,176
He should just see her once.
-I --

484
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:02,616
I talked to him,

485
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:04,386
But he changed the topic.

486
00:28:04,386 --> 00:28:06,786
Just insist.

487
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:07,876
C'mon, Rumi.

488
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:10,597
It's hard to stand firm about something like this.

489
00:28:10,597 --> 00:28:15,136
Besides, it's not like we're exactly friends that I'd pull his ear, saying, 'You have to meet her'!

490
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:19,246
Know what, you have a typical girly problem.

491
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:20,416
What?

492
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,747
Make friends with him, will you?

493
00:28:22,747 --> 00:28:24,027
You're too young, Rumi.

494
00:28:24,027 --> 00:28:27,098
You don't know what you're saying.

495
00:28:27,098 --> 00:28:31,208
I don't know why I feel that once Papa gets richer and richer,

496
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,140
He'll be out of reach.

497
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,850
He won't do that. Your Papa is a good man.

498
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,790
Just try to understand, teacher.

499
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,673
It won't be good if he liked someone else.

500
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:47,020
Just pray that he likes someone.

501
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,340
Everything will be good then.

502
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,926
What were you saying in class the other day?

503
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,260
What was I saying?

504
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,250
'One has to make an effort'.

505
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,600
Yes, so?

506
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,960
I'm making an effort.

507
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,199
Splendid. Keep it up.

508
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:06,330
And you'd also said, 'Help others'.

509
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,846
So I had.

510
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,826
So, won't you help me?

511
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,976
I'm feeling sleepy, Rumi.

512
00:29:13,976 --> 00:29:18,797
If someone asked me for help, I, too, would say that I'm sleepy.

513
00:29:18,797 --> 00:29:20,488
Okay, good night, teacher.

514
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,589
Hold on --

515
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,590
Yes, teacher?

516
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,731
I'll talk to him.

517
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,002
Thank you, teacher.

518
00:29:30,872 --> 00:29:31,983
Alright, catch some sleep now.

519
00:29:31,983 --> 00:29:34,200
I'm really very sleepy now!

520
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,346
Good night.

521
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:37,046
Good night.

522
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,280
How much is this for?

523
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,569
650 thousand.

524
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,569
I can have sleeves added, right?
-Of course, Ma'am.

525
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,559
Alright, get one like this ready.
-Alright. Thank you.

526
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,270
Please come to the jewellery shop as soon as the dress is ready.

527
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,900
Mehwish?

528
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,271
Anoushay?

529
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:43,866
What a surprise!

530
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,696
You've surprised me.

531
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:51,486
Started an affair with Shehwar, divorced Danish...

532
00:30:51,486 --> 00:30:52,916
And disappeared!

533
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,787
However did you manage it?

534
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,158
C'mon, mate.

535
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:59,130
It was written in my destiny.

536
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,286
Right...

537
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:03,730
When at a loss for an answer, just say, 'It was written in my destiny'...

538
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,896
What else is destined for you?

539
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,668
I'm marrying him.

540
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,669
Wow...

541
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,654
Didn't the poor chap cry?

542
00:31:14,654 --> 00:31:16,468
He must have.

543
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:19,500
How come he left you so easily?

544
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,707
It killed him to be away from you.

545
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:26,527
He just did.

546
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,490
He didn't bother me too much.

547
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,367
And Rumi...

548
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,568
Where's he?

549
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,348
He's with him.

550
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:38,600
That's fine,

551
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,160
But however does he sleep without you?

552
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,766
After all, he's just a kid.

553
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:49,910
What does he know that his Mum has an affair with someone and has left the house?

554
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,670
Do you

555
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,516
Meet him?

556
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,816
No.

557
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:01,707
He doesn't meet me.

558
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,228
It's good that I've met you, Anoushay.

559
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,180
Why don't you meet him?

560
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,870
He's in boarding school.

561
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,530
His hostel's just by the school.

562
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,790
He'd meet you.

563
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,550
Please, try to convince him.

564
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,700
You only needed to ask.

565
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,821
Danish has poisoned his ears.

566
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:28,136
He doesn't even want to see my face.

567
00:32:28,136 --> 00:32:30,520
Does he take good care of you?

568
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,916
Who?

569
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,916
Shehwar?

570
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,960
Very good, in fact!

571
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,986
Does he actually love you?

572
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:42,807
Very much.

573
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,600
Do you know his wife?

574
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
Yes.

575
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,590
I just know that it upsets him when she calls.

576
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,090
He hates it when she calls.

577
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,741
It's thanks to her that he's gotten here.

578
00:32:57,741 --> 00:32:58,840
In fact,

579
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,030
I've heard that he's taken over 1.2 million of her shares through forgery.

580
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,647
In fact, even the house he lives in

581
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,538
Is owned by her.

582
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:12,520
That's <i>mine</i>.

583
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,850
Besides, this is all hearsay.

584
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,326
Everything will be settled when she comes back from America,

585
00:33:17,326 --> 00:33:18,740
And once everything's settled,

586
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,927
They'll be divorced.

587
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,341
Shopping around here?

588
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,390
By the way,

589
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,800
May I ask something?

590
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:44,791
Didn't you feel pity for Danish?

591
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,172
Do you remember

592
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:48,280
How he'd say proudly,

593
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,920
'I've got Mehwish',

594
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,556
'So, I've got everything'.

595
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,300
Honestly,

596
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,521
Did he ever have you?

597
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,060
He used to suspect me so much, Anoushay,

598
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,770
And I was really fed up of it.

599
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,420
Don't say he used to suspect you.

600
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,810
Besides, even if he did,

601
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,706
His suspicious turned out to be true...

602
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,386
Anyway,

603
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:20,405
Good luck for you new marriage, I suppose.

604
00:34:20,405 --> 00:34:21,772
You're going?

605
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:22,906
Yes.

606
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:25,306
Won't you be there at the wedding?

607
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:27,470
I'd come if you invited.

608
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:34,020
We just bumped into each other, and you remembered that I'm someone, too, so you thought you'd just as well ask me,

609
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,120
'Are you coming'?

610
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,970
I mean,

611
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,306
Call me, request me, insist a bit.

612
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,737
I'll surely come if you did.

613
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,620
Alright, I'll call you

614
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,010
When you get back.

615
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,749
I'll insist a lot.

616
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:53,400
Okay, see you.

617
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,998
Bye.

618
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,036
Hi, teacher!

619
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,056
Hi!

620
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:37,396
So, were you waiting for me?

621
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,630
No, I was just watching you play.

622
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,121
Here.

623
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,556
Show me your car.

624
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:47,816
I'll show you when the driver's here.

625
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:49,233
Good.

626
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:53,070
So, I'll talk to your Papa today.

627
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,056
For sure?

628
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:55,037
For sure.

629
00:35:55,037 --> 00:35:57,670
But if you introduce me to her,

630
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,930
I'd insist all I can.

631
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,890
I don't have her picture.

632
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,360
Alright, tell me, where is she? What does she do?

633
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,026
I won't tell you that.

634
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:08,240
Why?

635
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,491
It's a secret.

636
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:16,934
Say, what if your Papa agreed, but she didn't?

637
00:36:17,282 --> 00:36:19,964
I didn't think about that.

638
00:36:20,282 --> 00:36:22,710
Then, talk to her first.

639
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,847
I'll talk to Papa if she agrees.

640
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,460
Otherwise, all my effort will go to waste.

641
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,671
50% of it is up to me.

642
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:31,616
What?

643
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,978
That I'd convince her.

644
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:36,000
And what about the other 50%?

645
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,660
That's where the problem starts.

646
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,400
Normally, girls are committed, or engaged.

647
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,676
Committed, as in?

648
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:47,446
It means, Rumi,

649
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:51,427
It means, Rumi, that they like someone, or they've promised someone.

650
00:36:51,427 --> 00:36:54,477
No, it's not like that.

651
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:57,852
Have you asked her?

652
00:36:57,852 --> 00:37:01,624
I guessed from her words.

653
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,211
How to tell if she's been engaged?

654
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,466
She wears a ring in this finger if she is.

655
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,500
Like you are?

656
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,750
No, this is an artificial one.

657
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,537
A real one's either gold or diamond.

658
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:23,273
Why?

659
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:25,604
Have you seen a ring on her hand?

660
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:29,000
No, she wears an artificial one too.

661
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,970
Please don't break your promise and talk to Papa.

662
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,550
And what if he said right away, 'I'm not marrying anyone'?

663
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:43,596
So what? Tell him Rumi's very lonely...

664
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,360
'He feels lonely when you're not at home'.

665
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:53,003
Tell him also that he's friends with her and won't have any fights with her.

666
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,576
Alright.

667
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:00,727
And

668
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:03,500
If he said,

669
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,120
'What do <i>you</i> care about it'?

670
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,246
Just hang up and don't say anything.

671
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,370
Have some water.

672
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,146
How do I look?

673
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,006
Haven't you seen yourself?

674
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:48,667
Tell me.

675
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,306
I'm seeing you through your eyes today.

676
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:59,976
Then I'm sure I look very comely!

677
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,749
Crazy lass.

678
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,146
Who is it?

679
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,590
Everything's ready for the wedding.

680
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,443
The priest and the witnesses are here.

681
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:16,686
Please come downstairs in 15 minutes.

682
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,370
Is Shehwar here?

683
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,827
Yes, he's here.

684
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:23,843
He's sitting by the priest.

685
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,668
Alright,

686
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:28,509
I'll come the next time you knock.

687
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:30,119
Alright.

688
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,260
I have a business proposal for you.

689
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,356
Pray tell.

690
00:40:04,356 --> 00:40:06,396
Share a membership with me.

691
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,219
50-50.

692
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,960
I lack the experience.

693
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,170
But I don't.

694
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,740
And I know that experience doesn't matter one bit before luck.

695
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,570
So you think I'm very lucky.

696
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,580
God is happy with you.

697
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,470
So, you're lucky.

698
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,859
The stock exchange <i>pundits</i> around here say, 'Partner with those who are lucky'.

699
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:30,769
'Don't compete with them'.

700
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,070
Tell me.

701
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,760
Let me think until Sunday.

702
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,710
Sunday's the day after tomorrow. What's there to think about?

703
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,570
Just try to understand, mate.

704
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,530
I'm not in the mood to talk about business today.

705
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,766
What happened? Is there any problem?

706
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:52,579
Once again, I've got a feeling something's not right...

707
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,260
My heart's sinking.

708
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,050
Then --

709
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,270
Then, c'mon, you need to see a doctor.

710
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,296
No, mate.

711
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:03,996
It's not sinking in the drowning way.

712
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:07,203
It's suffered one last wound.

713
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:08,740
It's just a bit shocked again.

714
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,266
It's just a bit shocked again. That's all.

715
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,450
<i>She</i>'s getting married today.

716
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,130
We'll meet on Sunday.

717
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,940
Then, today would've been an auspicious day, Danish.

718
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,567
All the rituals of separation will be done and over with today.

719
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,590
Alright, Anoushay, they're waiting. C'mon.

720
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,540
Alright, Anoushay, they're waiting. C'mon.
-C'mon.

721
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,976
Right...

722
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,840
I'm Maham.

723
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,550
Shehwar

724
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,200
Shehwar Ahmed's

725
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,000
Shehwar Ahmed's wife.

726
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
English translation: J. Mir
