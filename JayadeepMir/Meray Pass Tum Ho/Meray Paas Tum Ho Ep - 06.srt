1
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:18,493
Dad used to say,

2
00:00:18,493 --> 00:00:20,419
'You serve good food'

3
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:23,506
'To win one's heart'.

4
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:25,732
So, tell me, Mr Danish,

5
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:29,271
Have I been able to win yours?

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,465
Do you normally talk so little,

7
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,728
Or am I speaking too much?

8
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:37,898
I'm listening.

9
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:41,524
I'm looking at the confidence in a man's tone

10
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:44,086
When he's successful.

11
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,149
<i>You</i>'ve been successful, sir.

12
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,494
That's what I think.

13
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,724
Getting whatever you want

14
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:52,529
Is no success.

15
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:54,933
To get the one you like

16
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:59,912
Is success like no other.

17
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:05,310
Hey!

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,639
Serve him some soup.

19
00:01:07,639 --> 00:01:10,502
Try some of this soup.

20
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,799
Hey!
-Papa!

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,989
What's this?

22
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,657
Couldn't you pour it carefully?

23
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:20,907
Mr Diwan!

24
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:21,826
Danish,

25
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:23,223
You're alright, aren't you?

26
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:24,812
Please, take him to my room,

27
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:27,421
And give him a shirt from my wardrobe.

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,671
And stay with him.

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,769
He might need something.

30
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:33,695
Please, don't come downstairs.

31
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:44,566
You --

32
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:46,018
Just got worried so suddenly.

33
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,296
He'll be fine.

34
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,607
He'll be back in about 15 minutes.

35
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,405
Please, sit.

36
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,147
Sit.

37
00:01:53,907 --> 00:01:56,814
He'd ask me why I didn't go with him.

38
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:58,520
Then, just say,

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,646
'I would rather not go inside another man's bedroom'.

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,340
Everything happens as you wish.

41
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:22,375
I wish that he not come down all night,

42
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,792
But that won't happen.

43
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:32,816
How long have you been married?

44
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,214
8 years.
-Oh.

45
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,497
That's enough.

46
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:40,866
What do you mean, 'enough'?

47
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,624
It's enough

48
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,931
For a lovely lady like you to give a pleb

49
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:49,463
8 long years of her life.

50
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,993
It's hurt you?

51
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,979
Yes.

52
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,941
What do you like?

53
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,249
To live in pieces?

54
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,814
To live, entrapped by a man

55
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:08,620
Who's caught you like a hunter?

56
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,931
He loves me so much.
-Tell me, also, if he deserves your love.

57
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:17,308
Or if he deserves <i>you</i>.

58
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,668
Look, Mr Shehwar,

59
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,995
I like to talk to you,

60
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:27,168
But I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about these things.

61
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,246
Okay, sorry.

62
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,167
I won't say it again.

63
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,252
Where's your wife?

64
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,708
Who knows where she'd be!

65
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,318
Perhaps in New York, perhaps in Toronto...

66
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,189
She'd be <i>somewhere</i>...

67
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,553
She tells me when she calls.

68
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:51,899
What do you talk about?

69
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,647
About the business, about the profit...

70
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,819
Or, she gets angry

71
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,520
If a company's facing a loss.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,174
Doesn't she ask about you?

73
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,506
Yes.

74
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,706
Sometimes, she does ask about me, too.

75
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,146
She even says, chuckling,

76
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,646
'Why don't get married a second time'?

77
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,999
Have you had any issues?

78
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,276
Yes.

79
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:19,221
What?

80
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:24,925
We haven't had any issues of 'love' between us.

81
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:26,096
I'm sorry,

82
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,954
But sometimes,

83
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:31,499
I laugh at the wrong things.

84
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:34,087
Excuse me.
-Alright.

85
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:46,275
Did you have fun?

86
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,545
You enjoyed your movie?

87
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:50,370
How was the movie?

88
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,558
Innit?

89
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:53,653
Oh, great!

90
00:04:54,376 --> 00:04:56,784
Mr Danish,

91
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,560
Here's a watch for you.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,214
Hey -- Why?

93
00:05:00,214 --> 00:05:02,108
Please, keep it.

94
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:05,247
Consider it a friend's first gift.

95
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:07,712
Also, it's a tradition in my family

96
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,558
To give a gift to our guests

97
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,518
On their first visit here

98
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,885
To cherish the memories.

99
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:16,703
Please, take it, or it'd hurt me very much.

100
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,716
Thank you.

101
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:20,618
Here.

102
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:21,638
And

103
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:25,543
This is for you, Rumi; there's lots of chocolates in it.

104
00:05:25,543 --> 00:05:27,334
And here's a little piano,

105
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,841
It also has the tune I just played.
-Thank you.

106
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,684
You're welcome.

107
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,747
And

108
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,745
This is for you.

109
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,737
All of this is very expensive, Mr Shehwar...

110
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:45,783
Your lady is priceless, too.

111
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:52,256
Lovers are priceless.

112
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,657
Such things are an offering unto them.

113
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:58,098
In fact, why don't you have her

114
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,469
Put it on right now?

115
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,097
Please, put it on her.

116
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,204
I'd be chuffed if you put it on her.

117
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:13,379
Should I take this one off?

118
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,829
Mehwish!

119
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,250
Mehwish!

120
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:50,672
Why are you sleeping here?

121
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:54,922
It's --

122
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:56,861
I thought I'd just --

123
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:59,143
Try it on and see how it looks.

124
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:02,545
I fell asleep looking at it.

125
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,634
It's very expensive, innit?

126
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,744
Yes.

127
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,824
It suits you.

128
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:18,695
It looks priceless when you wear it.

129
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:22,535
Mr Shehwar's got a big heart.

130
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,981
Yes...

131
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,584
You don't mind it, do you?

132
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:31,744
What?

133
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:34,662
He gave a necklace,

134
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:36,789
And I accepted it.

135
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,458
Not at all.

136
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,676
He gave me a wristwatch

137
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:42,805
Before he gave you the necklace.

138
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,323
Right!

139
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,243
That looks very expensive too!

140
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:50,102
I've got it in charity.

141
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:51,896
What?

142
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,423
I'm kidding, mate!

143
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,522
Just kidding.

144
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:56,338
Come. We should sleep now.

145
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:58,460
C'mon.

146
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:24,784
Why did you say 'in charity'?

147
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,593
You would've minded it if I'd said 'brokerage'.

148
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,345
Even a tip is a kind of charity.

149
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:32,407
It doesn't sound as bad.

150
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,764
Why are you saying all of that?

151
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:37,518
What does it mean?

152
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:41,330
I don't know,

153
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,922
But in the beginning, when someone used to take a good look at you,

154
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,692
You'd whisper in my ear,

155
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:50,233
'Look at how he's staring at me'!

156
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,529
He was looking at you wide-eyed today,

157
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,261
And you never felt

158
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,389
That he was looking at you the wrong way.

159
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,871
So that's it!

160
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,610
So you're doubting his intentions.

161
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,233
I'm not talking about intentions.

162
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,982
I've seen his gaze.

163
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,015
So you're doubting <i>me</i>!

164
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,700
Shut up, Mehwish!

165
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,949
I cannot doubt you.

166
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:18,728
I'm just surprised that you couldn't see through his gaze today.

167
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:21,019
I felt it, too, in the beginning,

168
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,672
Had my suspicions, too,

169
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,826
But then, I realised

170
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,812
That it's impossible for him to not praise something beautiful,

171
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:32,627
Even if that's someone's wife.

172
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,031
Perhaps...

173
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:38,830
I would've felt bad about the same.

174
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:51,150
I can return the necklace to him if you want.

175
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,853
No, leave it be.

176
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:56,719
Why?

177
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,912
Because then,

178
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,833
I'd have to return the wristwatch too!

179
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,456
You're wicked!

180
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:10,302
I do feel, today, that I'm wicked.

181
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:14,110
I couldn't give you everything.

182
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,862
If you hadn't been so foolish as to return that money,

183
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:19,693
We would've gone there in our own car today.

184
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,229
Do you know, whenever I look at you,

185
00:11:22,229 --> 00:11:26,745
I say to God, 'Thank You so much',

186
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:29,177
And whenever I'm about to make a mistake,

187
00:11:29,177 --> 00:11:31,564
I feel that I'm insulting Him

188
00:11:31,564 --> 00:11:34,205
By thanking Him.

189
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:35,332
Oh, please...

190
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,290
May I ask you something?

191
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,193
Sure.

192
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,420
Why don't you think like I do?

193
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,446
Like what?

194
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,659
Just think you've got me.

195
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:52,520
Surely, I have.

196
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:57,631
Then, just say that you don't want anything else.

197
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:02,423
As in, say to God that I don't want anything else?

198
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,240
If He heard it,

199
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,239
He'd <i>actually</i> give nothing!

200
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,325
Please, go to sleep!

201
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,413
I want a lot from Him besides you.

202
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:16,414
C'mon, now! Off to bed!

203
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:50,272
He'll be back in about 15 minutes.

204
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:51,783
Please, sit.

205
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,721
Sit.

206
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,806
He'd ask me why I didn't go with him.

207
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,451
Just tell him, then,

208
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:04,105
'I would rather not go into another man's bedroom'.

209
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:07,572
Everything happens as you wish.

210
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:11,855
I wish that he not come down all night,

211
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,634
But this won't happen.

212
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,485
Your phone's ringing, Maman!

213
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,719
Hello?

214
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,348
How are you, mate?

215
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:32,654
You haven't called since you went back!

216
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:34,360
Anoushay?

217
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,004
Yes,

218
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:37,125
Didn't you see the number?

219
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,568
I didn't...
-Alright, listen.

220
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,533
The bride and groom have left for their honeymoon.

221
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,114
Where to?

222
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,766
London.

223
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,439
Wow...

224
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,838
I find the cow a dodgy type!

225
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:50,712
Who?

226
00:13:50,712 --> 00:13:53,119
My sister-in-law, of course!

227
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,947
Why? What happened?

228
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:57,278
One look at her had told me enough.

229
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,775
But don't worry,

230
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:02,064
<i>I</i> can be more dodgy than her!

231
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:04,020
Has Danish left?

232
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,233
Yes, he'd left at 7.30.

233
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,641
Why not come over, then? We'll have a nice chat.

234
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,863
Oh!

235
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,861
How surprised I was that day!

236
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:16,453
Danish and Shehwar have made such friends!

237
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,418
Yes.

238
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,728
Have you ever noticed Mr Shehwar?

239
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,079
He's stunned for a moment at the sight of you.

240
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,204
Why?

241
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:25,575
It's natural, mate...

242
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:31,783
Men are stunned for a moment when they see a comely woman.

243
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:35,533
Did you talk about anything?

244
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,223
Talk?

245
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,019
Just the usual 'His' and 'Hellos'.

246
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:43,174
I know he doesn't even bother that someone's sitting right there...

247
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:47,289
Do you know what he'd said when he'd first seen you?

248
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,595
What did he say?

249
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:53,597
'Who's that angel, Anoushay'?

250
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:58,275
Anyway, I'm going shopping. Want to come along?

251
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:59,464
No.

252
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,443
I have neither the mood, nor the money...

253
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,761
Poor people...

254
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:03,819
Well...

255
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,945
Bye.

256
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,804
Bye.

257
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:18,759
Yes?

258
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,650
Right!

259
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,324
I almost forgot to tell you!

260
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:23,478
What?

261
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,946
He might invite the two of you over for dinner.

262
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:29,666
Please, don't decline. Just go.

263
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,717
Sure, we will.

264
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:34,291
Why are you so teed off?

265
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,980
No -- I was just -- giving Rumi his breakfast.

266
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,957
Alright. Give him his breakfast.

267
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,985
Bye.

268
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:56,379
You haven't finished it yet!

269
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:57,578
Here.

270
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,787
Let me feed you.

271
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,201
Good boy!

272
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,881
You have to drop it!

273
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,270
Mr Danish!

274
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,235
Please sign this.

275
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,633
What's this file about?

276
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:35,363
The boss has served you a memo.

277
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,644
What for?

278
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:38,001
You came late twice,

279
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,969
And left at 3 one day

280
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:42,477
Without even telling the boss.

281
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,345
I'd told him, Mr Matin. I swear to God I did.

282
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,376
You would've told him over the phone.

283
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,064
So?

284
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,270
One informs in writing, Mr Danish.

285
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,048
Telephonic conversations are off-the-record.

286
00:16:55,048 --> 00:17:00,149
Mr Matin --
-Write in the reply that you'd informed him over the phone.

287
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,863
But of course, I will.

288
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:05,346
Then sign it and write today's date.

289
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,140
Give me the pen.

290
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,805
That's what would happen

291
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:29,146
If you turn Plutus down when he knocks.

292
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:31,457
What do you mean?

293
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:35,261
You've returned a million Rupees,

294
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:38,793
But do you know how many months' worth of salary that is?

295
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,184
It's a lifetime's worth of disgrace, sir!

296
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:45,293
One's dishonoured in his own eyes.

297
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:24,707
Yes, Danish?

298
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,884
Hey!

299
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:29,397
So romantic a voice!

300
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:31,757
You've just gotten up, haven't you?

301
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,645
No, I've just taken a bath.

302
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,835
Oh.

303
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:37,301
So that's why you didn't answer the phone.

304
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,738
Yes -- Everything alright?

305
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:40,523
I've --

306
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,273
Gotten a memo.

307
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,223
Memo?

308
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:50,026
The boss has asked for an explanation about arriving late twice and leaving early once.

309
00:18:50,026 --> 00:18:52,238
What did you leave early for?

310
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,460
That was

311
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,134
When I'd come to you with the one million.

312
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:57,413
Oh,

313
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:58,834
So didn't you ask when coming?

314
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,351
I did, mate.

315
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:03,943
But asking and informing over the phone is off-the-record.

316
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,536
But I know

317
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:07,945
What my actual crime has been.

318
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,648
What?

319
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,959
I didn't take a bribe of one million.

320
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,927
Then you deserve this memo.

321
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:19,763
I would've done the same in your boss' place.

322
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,525
Someone's ringing the bell.

323
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,166
Yes.

324
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,174
Hello?

325
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,857
Hi!

326
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,504
I've been thinking of calling you since the morning,

327
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:46,503
But realised that merely talking won't satisfy me.

328
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,437
I -- I'm sorry, but I can't --

329
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,302
Allow you in.

330
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,768
I won't come inside.

331
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:57,818
I've seen you.

332
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:00,147
That's enough.

333
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,283
I can while the day away now.

334
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Bye.

335
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:28,439
Who were you talking to?

336
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:32,457
Someone rang the bell by mistake.

337
00:20:32,457 --> 00:20:34,531
He wanted to go to 408.

338
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:38,110
I thought it's Shehwar Uncle.

339
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,348
Why would he come here?

340
00:20:42,348 --> 00:20:44,251
Can't he come here?

341
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,675
Why did we go there?

342
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:48,794
Of course he can.

343
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:49,593
But

344
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,954
He'd come if we invited him,

345
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:53,909
Just like he invited us, okay?

346
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:55,237
Then, invite him.

347
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:59,030
He'd bring a lot of chocolates for us.

348
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:02,030
Ask your Dad; he'd invite him.

349
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,997
That's alright, but what if he didn't bring chocolates?

350
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:21,148
Hello?

351
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:23,634
I'm so sorry.

352
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:25,273
Why are you saying sorry?

353
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:27,304
I showed up

354
00:21:27,304 --> 00:21:29,475
Uninvited, without a word,

355
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,867
Without a thought, without asking...

356
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,747
But what could I do?

357
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:37,995
I had two important meetings today,

358
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:40,946
But I don't feel like going anywhere.

359
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,776
You're alright, aren't you?

360
00:21:42,776 --> 00:21:44,887
Obviously, I wasn't alright.

361
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:49,357
That's why I'd come to you to get cured.

362
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:54,133
Seeing you was like this patient getting his medicine.

363
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:57,939
Know what, one can't help but remember your words...

364
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,454
May I ask something?

365
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:01,034
Yes?

366
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:05,038
Don't you feel like meeting the one

367
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,038
Whose words you can't help but remember?

368
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,518
We just met last night?

369
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,270
Just that?

370
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,218
Is one night enough?

371
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:25,346
One regularly meets those one likes in memories.

372
00:22:25,346 --> 00:22:28,080
I swear, I stop in my tracks, thinking of your words.

373
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,194
You say whatever comes to your mind.

374
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:33,927
I start stammering if I lie,

375
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:37,539
Or start taking long pauses.

376
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,563
You lie, too?

377
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,708
A lot, now.

378
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,553
I even tell myself if I'm unable to sleep

379
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:48,830
That you're with me.

380
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,931
Danish is calling.

381
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,166
Okay, bye.

382
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,431
Okay, bye.

383
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,289
Yes, Danish?

384
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:07,335
You hung up as the doorbell rang.

385
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,464
Who was it?

386
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:10,620
It was --

387
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,691
Someone wanted to go to 408. Came to 308 instead.

388
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:15,512
Oh...

389
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:18,466
I didn't hang up. The call got dropped.

390
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:20,091
Alright, listen.

391
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:22,012
I've written the reply,

392
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:26,450
And I've also written that it's the first time someone's served me a memo.

393
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,588
Who've you written to?

394
00:23:28,588 --> 00:23:32,160
The boss had asked for an explanation, remember?

395
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,750
Right...

396
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,629
I'm talking about that.

397
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:37,782
Alright.

398
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:38,638
Alright,

399
00:23:38,638 --> 00:23:41,169
Alright, I'll go and prepare dinner. Bye.

400
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,076
Okay,

401
00:23:42,076 --> 00:23:43,326
Bye.

402
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:45,519
Bye.

403
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,392
Here's a watch for you.

404
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:16,334
It's a friend's first gift to his friend.

405
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:18,834
Also, it's a tradition in my family

406
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,716
To give a gift to our guests

407
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:22,565
On their first visit here

408
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:24,552
To cherish the memories.

409
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:25,507
And

410
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:29,520
This is for you, Mr Rumi; there's a lot of chocolates in this.

411
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,383
And here's a little piano,

412
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,847
It also has the tune I'd just played.
-Thank you.

413
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,659
You're welcome.

414
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:37,689
And

415
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:40,647
This is for you.

416
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,564
All of this is very expensive, Mr Shehwar...

417
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:48,138
Your lady is priceless, too.

418
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:49,948
Hey!

419
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,717
It's you!

420
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:53,027
You live in our building, right?
-Yes.

421
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:54,464
Please, sit, then.

422
00:25:54,464 --> 00:25:55,527
Thank you.

423
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:59,100
I've seen you around many times.

424
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,039
Yes. The name's Nasir.

425
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:04,782
Yes, I'd forgotten the name.

426
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:06,711
Do you work around here?

427
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,212
No, I'd come here for the Judge's work.

428
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:13,337
I'm the Civil Judge's reader.

429
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:14,844
Oh.

430
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:16,397
Yes.

431
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,835
No, he's not here yet.

432
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,496
He'd be coming any time.

433
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,228
Do you stay at home all day?

434
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:23,630
Yes.

435
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,710
I'm at home most of the time.

436
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,381
Sometimes, I go shopping,

437
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:31,755
Or we go out on Sundays.

438
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:34,559
How say you start working?

439
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,649
Working?

440
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:40,496
For me, at my office?

441
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:45,316
I'll pay you a hundred thousand as salary.

442
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:48,911
What does Mr Danish give you?

443
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,844
I mean,

444
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:54,035
How much does he earn?

445
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:56,837
Very little...

446
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:58,882
Then say yes, will you?

447
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:00,565
It'll be a job for you,

448
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:03,164
And a cure for me.

449
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:05,102
What kind of cure?

450
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:06,981
I'd told you, mate.

451
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:10,947
To get to see your face is what lures me,

452
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:16,979
He may strike a deal with me about it.

453
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:19,185
Tell me.

454
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:23,309
He won't agree.

455
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,473
So he doesn't listen to you.

456
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,226
He does, but...

457
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:32,679
But he wouldn't ever agree if I were to talk about working for you.

458
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:35,989
Does he doubt you?

459
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,989
He doubts <i>you</i>.

460
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,026
You, too, look at me like that...

461
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:44,966
It's clear that you're only looking at me.

462
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,996
But you know what, I can't help it.

463
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:49,318
That's the problem with me -

464
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:51,204
My eyes start looking for you

465
00:27:51,204 --> 00:27:55,371
The moment I wake up.

466
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,342
I know it isn't good for either of us.

467
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:02,369
He'd obviously feel bad about it,

468
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,307
But I fear

469
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:09,307
That <i>you</i> may feel bad about it too...

470
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:13,141
I'm sorry, but inviting you over for dinner,

471
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,283
Offering you a job,

472
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:18,424
These were all but excuses, Mehwish,

473
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:20,558
To see you,

474
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,904
To meet you.

475
00:28:25,483 --> 00:28:29,798
You, too, said the other day, 'I won't listen to such things'.

476
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,262
Do you know

477
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:34,451
I kept cursing myself all night?

478
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,151
Why did I say that?

479
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:39,486
Why did such a thing ever come out of my mouth

480
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:42,691
That you minded?

481
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:45,100
But what can I do, Mehwish?

482
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,018
If I meet you,

483
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,097
Look at you,

484
00:28:48,097 --> 00:28:51,657
I won't be able to stop myself.

485
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:55,993
That's the problem with me, Mehwish - I can't hold my heart's thoughts in

486
00:28:55,993 --> 00:28:59,439
Because I'm not an actor.

487
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,503
Okay,

488
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:02,251
I'll do something.

489
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:03,659
I won't meet you.

490
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,681
I won't call, nor talk to you, nor show up at your doorstep to see you.

491
00:29:08,681 --> 00:29:10,961
I'll try to explain to myself, control myself,

492
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:13,111
And just think

493
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:16,706
That I have no right over your any bit of your splendour.

494
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,673
Bye.

495
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,553
Thank you so much, Mr Danish.

496
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:53,568
It's nothing, really.

497
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:56,153
Come over someday, perhaps when you have an off?

498
00:29:56,153 --> 00:29:57,616
We'll have a nice chat.

499
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:59,459
I live in #408.

500
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:01,339
408?
-Yes.

501
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,388
The flat just above yours.

502
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:05,000
Splendid...

503
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,109
What a strange coincidence!

504
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,578
Just today,

505
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:12,110
Someone who wanted to go to 408 showed up at our flat.

506
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,514
Oh?

507
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:14,436
Alright,

508
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:17,395
We'll meet properly on a Sunday.
-Sure.

509
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,318
Bye.
-Okay.

510
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:20,370
Sir!

511
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,584
Someone had come to meet you, too, sir.

512
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,746
Mentioned your name and asked your flat number,

513
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:26,650
So I told him.

514
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,085
Didn't you say I wasn't at home?

515
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:31,458
No, sir, I couldn't dare, seeing his personality.

516
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,400
But I kept an eye on him anyway.

517
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,023
He never went beyond the door.

518
00:30:35,023 --> 00:30:36,053
Rang the bell,

519
00:30:36,053 --> 00:30:38,462
Talked to your wife, and came back.

520
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,746
I think she told him that you're not at home.

521
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,523
Right...

522
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:45,762
He came in a big car, didn't he?

523
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,943
Yes.

524
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,820
Okay.

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,131
Alright.

526
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,040
Thank you.

527
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:58,476
I think I should start working.

528
00:30:58,476 --> 00:31:01,054
May I?

529
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,586
Have I ever stopped you?

530
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:08,800
You wouldn't agree in the beginning...

531
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:12,746
I used to think like any other young man back then -

532
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,979
'I'd do this for you',

533
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:17,926
'I'd do that for you'...

534
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:21,268
But I couldn't do anything.

535
00:31:26,211 --> 00:31:28,880
Is there any offer?

536
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,255
One doesn't get an offer sitting at home.

537
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:35,036
I'll prepare a CV and go a few places.

538
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:39,072
Let's see how it goes.

539
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:42,320
You won't get a good salary because you don't have experience.

540
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,200
But you should try.

541
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:50,662
You know why I'm doing this, right?

542
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:53,207
Yes.

543
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,784
You want to give me a hand,

544
00:31:56,784 --> 00:32:00,940
Send Rumi to a good school.

545
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,905
By the way, you could surely get a job as a PRO.

546
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:11,910
Good looks matter more than experience.

547
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,874
Don't send just your CV.

548
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:17,766
Send your pictures along, too.

549
00:32:17,766 --> 00:32:19,580
You'll see,

550
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,972
You'll get an offer in a flash.

551
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,540
Had your dinner?

552
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,468
Didn't I eat properly?

553
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:35,954
I'd had a few samosas with Mr Nasir,

554
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,203
So...

555
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:38,408
Who's Mr Nasir?

556
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:40,626
He lives in our building

557
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,624
On the floor upstairs.

558
00:32:42,624 --> 00:32:45,501
He asked for a lift, and we became friends,

559
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:48,477
And two friends enjoyed samosas on the way back.

560
00:32:48,477 --> 00:32:51,378
I'd like some green tea if you're making some.

561
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,472
Alright?

562
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:17,334
Rumi!

563
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,474
Come here and have something.

564
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,260
Coming, Maman!

565
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:36,297
Should I talk to Anoushay?

566
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,262
About what?

567
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:41,137
Mr Shehwar, you know,

568
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:43,340
He's got such a flourishing business.

569
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,198
So?

570
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,323
I'll ask Anoushay

571
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:50,418
To talk to him about a job.

572
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,184
Why do you need to talk to Anoushay about that?

573
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:55,301
You can

574
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,669
Talk to him, too.

575
00:34:57,669 --> 00:34:58,887
Me?

576
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:01,278
How could I?

577
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:03,479
We're friends with him.

578
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:06,484
You won't even have to send your CV and pictures.

579
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,907
And I'm sure

580
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:11,717
You'll be getting a good salary.

581
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:14,269
So --

582
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,165
Why don't you talk?

583
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:17,613
No...

584
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:21,993
If I talk, it'll seem as if I'm acting as a <i>souteneur</i>.

585
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:24,101
<i>Souteneur</i>?

586
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:28,927
Look at what I just said!

587
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:33,612
I mean, it wouldn't seem proper if I talk.

588
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:51,699
Go and change first. Put the remote down.

589
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,728
Quickly, now.

590
00:35:54,341 --> 00:35:56,421
Should I get you some tea?

591
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,284
Please.

592
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:21,985
If I talk, it'll seem as if I'm acting as a <i>souteneur</i>.

593
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:34,993
The thing

594
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:38,912
About being a <i>souteneur</i> is still bothering me.

595
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:41,270
Why did you say that?

596
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,370
I didn't really think when saying that, Mehwish.

597
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:46,877
It just slipped from my mouth.

598
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:49,124
I'm sorry.

599
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:54,891
You're feeling bad about me working, right?

600
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,668
Tell me.

601
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:57,957
Right?

602
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:58,852
No.

603
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:00,951
I don't mind it.

604
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:03,668
I just don't like it.

605
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:05,669
And

606
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:06,884
Where'd Rumi go?

607
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:08,831
Rumi would be at school, of course.

608
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:11,197
School's over at 1.30.

609
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:12,076
Then?

610
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,384
Then, he'd be with a maid.

611
00:37:14,384 --> 00:37:15,950
Yes...

612
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,840
But how would we get a maid?

613
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,856
We would, Danish.

614
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,419
Think over it...

615
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:25,763
But if you get him admitted to a school that costs less,

616
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:27,595
I can manage.

617
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,059
We could've done so last year if we wanted to.

618
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:32,933
You know what, school is really important!

619
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:35,307
You haven't even started working,

620
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:38,032
But you've started speaking English so fluently!

621
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:40,758
Practicing, eh?

622
00:37:42,235 --> 00:37:44,472
The water's boiling.

623
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,111
I have no problem if you work somewhere else.

624
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:55,097
I have a problem if you work <i>there</i>.

625
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:56,142
There, as in?

626
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:59,098
I'm talking about Mr Shehwar.

627
00:37:59,098 --> 00:38:01,446
Maybe he's a good man,

628
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,586
But...

629
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:06,595
When he looks at you,

630
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:11,692
It feels like he's ogling you.

631
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:37,881
Why haven't you slept?

632
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:41,312
I'm trying to sleep.

633
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:45,378
You feel bad about it, don't you?

634
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,085
I'll tell you something.

635
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,988
People would look at me like that

636
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:58,054
Wherever I go.

637
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:01,665
They'd talk about me, too.

638
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:02,412
And

639
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:05,463
Praise me when they get the chance, too.

640
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:09,087
But they'd pay me less.

641
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:15,102
I'd get a better salary there.

642
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:22,120
I know you're very possessive about me.

643
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,870
You don't like it

644
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,696
If someone looks at me or talks about me again and again.

645
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:30,168
But people do look,

646
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,341
And try to talk,

647
00:39:32,341 --> 00:39:36,066
Even when I'm with you.

648
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:37,543
What do you mean?

649
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:39,998
It'd be bad if <i>I</i> look at someone,

650
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:42,666
Start talking to someone.

651
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:46,790
People's intentions and ways won't change if you fear their gaze.

652
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,089
So, stop thinking about them.

653
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:50,886
Think about me.

654
00:39:50,886 --> 00:39:53,696
Look at me.

655
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:54,792
Why, then,

656
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,262
Did you not tell me he'd come here?

657
00:39:57,262 --> 00:40:01,493
Why did you lie that someone who wanted to go to 408 came to 308 by mistake?

658
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:04,119
Because he'd come here uninvited.

659
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:07,309
I was shocked to see him, too.

660
00:40:07,309 --> 00:40:10,434
Do you remember that I'd hung up the phone while talking to you?

661
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,479
Ask me why.

662
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,781
Why?

663
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:15,240
So you can't know

664
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,902
Or get angry to hear about it;

665
00:40:16,902 --> 00:40:19,775
So you don't think anything wrong and get all worked up.

666
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,713
Why did he come at all?

667
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:24,978
And why did he come when he knew I wouldn't be home?

668
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:27,218
Because I wasn't answering his call.

669
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,278
What?

670
00:40:28,278 --> 00:40:31,453
He calls you, too?

671
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:34,294
He doesn't call me; he'd called me once.

672
00:40:34,294 --> 00:40:37,279
I disconnected when I saw that it's Shehwar.

673
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,173
How did he get your number?

674
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,046
He'd come to tell me about that.

675
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,671
He'd gotten my number from Anoushay

676
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:46,387
Because he wants to help you.

677
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:48,606
He wants that I should work at his office,

678
00:40:48,606 --> 00:40:50,733
Help you.

679
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:51,816
And

680
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,206
He's even offered me a salary.

681
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:56,739
He said he'd pay me a hundred thousand a month.

682
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:59,723
A <i>hundred thousand</i> a month?

683
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,365
As in, <i>start</i> at a hundred thousand?

684
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:03,962
That's what he'd said.

685
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,544
What did you say?

686
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:09,256
I said, 'Please talk to Danish'.

687
00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:11,257
He didn't talk to me about anything.

688
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:13,426
He's even got my number.

689
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:15,074
Listen to me, will you?

690
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:16,882
He said, 'I'll talk to Danish'

691
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,676
'If you agree to it',

692
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:23,364
'Or he'd think I'm doing a favour on him'.

693
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:25,583
Oh...

694
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:28,179
He's so clever!

695
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,586
He's not clever,

696
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:31,383
He's just a friend.

697
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:34,119
But if you still think he's not a good man,

698
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,180
And he's -- very clever, it's okay.

699
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,466
I won't work there.

700
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:43,274
Go to sleep, please.

701
00:41:56,006 --> 00:41:57,716
And ask your spies

702
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,711
Who've told you

703
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:01,147
That he'd come -

704
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:04,583
Did I let him in?

705
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,003
Is there any problem?

706
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:27,238
No?

707
00:42:27,238 --> 00:42:29,630
Maman's angry.

708
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,065
No, she's fine.

709
00:42:31,065 --> 00:42:37,408
I'm honest, Papa. She talks a lot while cooking breakfast.

710
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,728
Ask her.

711
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,820
Maman!

712
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,335
Go on!

713
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:03,147
See that? She said 'Go on'; she usually says, 'Yes'?

714
00:43:11,178 --> 00:43:13,226
What is it?

715
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:16,332
You're angry?

716
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:20,622
100% she is!

717
00:43:20,622 --> 00:43:21,405
C'mon,

718
00:43:21,405 --> 00:43:23,934
Finish it quickly.

719
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:27,435
What are you doing? Let go!

720
00:43:27,435 --> 00:43:29,056
Listen for a moment.

721
00:43:29,056 --> 00:43:31,523
I don't have any spies.

722
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:34,105
I'd given Mr Nasir a lift the day before yesterday.

723
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:37,000
He lives in #408.

724
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,295
The guard told me before him,

725
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:42,323
'A man who looks like that had come to your flat'.

726
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:46,218
'I left him at your doorstep when he asked me your flat number'.

727
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:52,951
Leave it be.
-I was just angry that you hadn't told me.

728
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:56,462
We'll talk after breakfast.

729
00:43:56,462 --> 00:43:58,637
Don't talk about working for him.

730
00:43:58,637 --> 00:44:00,849
Please.

731
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,664
I've seen his gaze, Mehwish,

732
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:07,187
And before that, I've seen the world.

733
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:10,452
A man's gaze is his first introduction,

734
00:44:10,452 --> 00:44:16,928
It shows his intentions and what his character's like.

735
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
