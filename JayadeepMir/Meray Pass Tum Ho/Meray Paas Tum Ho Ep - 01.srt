English translation: J. Mir

2
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,170
What's this, sir?

3
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,567
300, not 200.

4
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:26,985
300 for what?

5
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:28,162
We'd agreed on 200.

6
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:29,754
We had, sir,

7
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:34,224
But we hadn't agreed that you'd stop for half an hour for some <i>chaat</i> [snack].

8
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,272
Half an hour?

9
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:37,165
More like 5 minutes!

10
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,549
You look like you're a learned man, sir...

11
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:39,387
What do you mean?

12
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:40,710
Why are you lying, sir?

13
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,308
What?

14
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:44,394
It took your son ten minutes to relieve himself.

15
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:46,613
What are you saying?
-Just give him 300, will you?

16
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:50,068
Don't create a scene on the road.

17
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,303
Thank you, sir.

18
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:53,804
Hey!

19
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:56,521
And where are you off to?

20
00:01:59,044 --> 00:01:59,958
Milord!

21
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:04,008
I'm no Lord, mate!
-But you are, to me. Sit.

22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,460
Bye!

23
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,820
C'mon! I'm starving!

24
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:04,670
Never mind!

25
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,984
There.

26
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,639
Right here.

27
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,107
Alright.

28
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,096
Here.

29
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,073
Here.

30
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:14,020
Have this.

31
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,466
We'll have dinner later in the evening.

32
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,680
Done.

33
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,699
Hey!

34
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,278
Ask where we'd have dinner.

35
00:03:23,278 --> 00:03:25,443
At home?

36
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:27,627
No, sir.

37
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:30,252
We're eating out.

38
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,768
Why?

39
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,895
Look at how much we've spent...

40
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,599
Don't be such a Scrooge.

41
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,127
I'll manage.

42
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,439
Alright.
-Here.

43
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,423
Fine.

44
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:43,869
We're eating out.

45
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,824
By the way...

46
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:52,122
What?

47
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,840
Nothing.

48
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,808
Look at this one.

49
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,300
Here comes the food...

50
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,428
Come here. Sit down, quick.

51
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:04,504
Yummy!

52
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,560
Here.

53
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,030
Sit down.

54
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:30,035
Have him stop here.

55
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:30,807
Why?

56
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:31,920
What is it?

57
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,573
I'll show you something.

58
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:38,053
Yes, but...

59
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,803
I'm not asking you to buy me anything.

60
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:42,735
I just want to show you something.

61
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,599
Please stop it here.

62
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,629
Right, stop here.

63
00:05:49,004 --> 00:05:51,021
Come on. Just a minute!

64
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,911
C'mon!

65
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:55,443
Just two minutes,

66
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,505
Mate.

67
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:00,102
Quickly, now.

68
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:01,697
What is it?

69
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:04,105
What is it?

70
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,219
This is the necklace.

71
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:09,201
How much does it cost?

72
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:10,740
I didn't ask the price.

73
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,302
I saw it when I came here with Anoushay.

74
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:14,989
It's beautiful, innit?

75
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,613
Very.

76
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:18,428
I've saved 28,000.

77
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,678
I'll buy it one day, for sure.

78
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,616
It'll be sold out by then, Mehwish.

79
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,102
So what?

80
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:27,179
I'll buy another one like this.

81
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,680
It's absolutely lovely.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,548
Innit?

83
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,767
C'mon, it's been two minutes already.

84
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:35,142
The rickshaw driver will charge an extra 100 Rupees. Come!
-Double time!

85
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:40,845
Get in.

86
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:42,703
Get in!

87
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:57,957
Quickly now, have a shower and go to bed.
-Okay.

88
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,217
What's with the TV?

89
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,641
Go to bed right now.

90
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:10,106
Always glued to your cartoons!

91
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:28,255
What's up?

92
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,223
I'm beholding my affluence.

93
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:33,349
There, now.

94
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:34,869
I'm honest.

95
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,567
If I ever feel that I don't have much money in my pockets,

96
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,894
I pull out my wallet and look at your picture;

97
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:45,613
In but a moment, a gust of opulence overwhelms me.

98
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,096
Get me that necklace, will you?

99
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,857
That's what I'm thinking.

100
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:54,575
But first, I need to know its price...

101
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:58,894
Around 80 or 90, perhaps?

102
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:02,563
And you said you've only got 28,000.

103
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,035
Yes.

104
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,485
That leaves...

105
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,049
50 to 60 thousand...

106
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,206
It's too much, isn't it?

107
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:15,863
Two months' salary...

108
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,697
So, what now...?

109
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:25,051
Just go to bed.

110
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,209
You're actually awake, aren't you?

111
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,983
How would you sleep...

112
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:57,922
How must it feel to think that your husband

113
00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:02,203
Can't even get you a piffling necklace!

114
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,476
Honestly,

115
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,835
I'm troubled far more than you are.

116
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,146
Please, go to sleep.

117
00:09:12,146 --> 00:09:14,915
I can't sleep.

118
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:20,490
My status jeers at me, Mehwish.

119
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:24,072
However do I tell you,

120
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:30,726
My heart wants to get you all the necklaces in the world.

121
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:34,163
You're insulting me now, Danish.

122
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,656
Insulting?

123
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:39,555
What are you saying?

124
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,828
I'm drowning in shame.

125
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:48,101
When did I ask you to <i>actually</i> get me that necklace?

126
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,350
Just --

127
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,837
I liked it.

128
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:53,761
I thought I'd buy it one day.

129
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,837
It's not like I'd die if I didn't.

130
00:09:55,837 --> 00:09:56,789
C'mon now.

131
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:57,758
Go to sleep.

132
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:59,211
You have to go to office in the morning.

133
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:02,941
You're always late on Mondays.

134
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:11,371
You're pitying my helplessness, aren't you?

135
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:12,808
Well...

136
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:15,497
Here we go again.

137
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:20,155
There's nothing like that, my dear.

138
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:23,934
I'm happy with how you keep me.

139
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:26,387
I love you.

140
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:28,820
I love you too.

141
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,200
Go to sleep.

142
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,691
Good morning.

143
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,274
Good morning., sir.

144
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,744
'Morning.
-How are you?

145
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:33,540
Everything fine?

146
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,149
Good morning., sir.
-Good morning..

147
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,236
Tea?

148
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:49,377
Yes, please.

149
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,556
By the way,

150
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,040
Surely you don't smoke?

151
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,314
No.

152
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,848
Well, sometimes...

153
00:11:57,848 --> 00:11:59,379
Give me one too.

154
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,735
Sir?

155
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,082
You'd smoke?

156
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:04,878
I don't really smoke

157
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:07,362
But you know, like... Sometimes?

158
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,971
Tell me,

159
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:14,487
What happened to Mr Mohabbat Ali?

160
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:16,645
Did he see the boss again?

161
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,766
He showed up the day before yesterday as you left.

162
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,690
The boss gave him a prompt reply,

163
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,348
And even said,

164
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,252
'I'll sign it only'

165
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,174
'If Mr Danish signs it'.

166
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,917
This is the necklace.

167
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,182
How much does it cost?

168
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:38,715
I didn't ask the price.

169
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,263
I saw it when I came here with Anoushay.

170
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:43,095
Very beautiful, innit?

171
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,668
Very.

172
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:46,402
I've saved 28,000.

173
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:49,338
I'll buy it one day, for sure.

174
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,103
Your tea, sir.

175
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:56,357
If I ever feel that I don't have much money in my pockets,

176
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,627
I pull out my wallet and look at your picture;

177
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:03,887
In but a moment, a gust of opulence overwhelms me.

178
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,369
Hello!
-Hello!

179
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,833
So early?

180
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,472
Strolling about till the evening drives me mad.

181
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:19,831
How are you, you wee kid?

182
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:21,318
Not 'wee kid', it's Rumi.

183
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,783
Alright, wee Rumi, how are you?

184
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,034
Strolling about, as in?

185
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:27,096
You know my blighter of a brother?

186
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:30,330
He suddenly figured he should get married.

187
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,205
What?

188
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,488
He's getting married?

189
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:33,537
Yes.

190
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:35,065
Getting married as if

191
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:37,690
The girl's running off to marry someone else on Saturday

192
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,093
If he doesn't marry her on Friday.

193
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:41,747
What?

194
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,522
The wedding's on Friday?

195
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:48,782
The wedding's on Friday, the Mehendi's on Thursday, and the Dholak's on Wednesday [rituals].

196
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:50,520
Wow...

197
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,561
Honestly, though,

198
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:56,202
I'm pitying Danish.

199
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:57,298
Why?

200
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:01,288
Well, obviously, if he had to get three gowns at the end of the month,

201
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:04,076
He'd curse <i>me</i> along with my brother too, right?

202
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:06,624
Could you please speak in a low voice? I'm watching this cartoon.

203
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,781
Awrite, sir.

204
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:10,310
But...

205
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,343
Why are you watching a cartoon right now?

206
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:14,547
Shouldn't you be at school?

207
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,467
He --

208
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,999
Hasn't started school yet.

209
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,499
I'm thinking of getting him enrolled next month.

210
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,608
My Meerab's younger than him, isn't she?

211
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:24,125
Jeez, she's a full two months younger than him!

212
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,469
She'll be going to prep now.

213
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:29,687
And this rascal's at home, watching cartoons!

214
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,338
What rascal?

215
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:32,571
Hey!

216
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,796
She's just joking.

217
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,176
Watch your cartoon.

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,116
May I come in, sir?

219
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,548
Come in, Mr Danish.

220
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,335
Sit.

221
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:49,466
Danish,

222
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:50,858
This is Mr Mohabbat Ali.

223
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,858
He wants to talk to you.

224
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:55,013
Please, discuss it thoroughly with him,

225
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,006
And if you understand what he says,

226
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,429
It'd be great,

227
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,499
Otherwise, for my part, I've told him that

228
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:04,576
It's a tad on the illegal side of things.

229
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:17,192
He's saying '<i>a tad</i> illegal' because of you.

230
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:20,917
I say it's <i>completely</i> illegal!

231
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,700
It's neither under my control,

232
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,606
Nor his authority.

233
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,106
There may be

234
00:16:27,106 --> 00:16:29,528
Some questioning later.

235
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,417
Who's there to question?

236
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,965
A man who'd question those

237
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:37,511
Who've been running this country for 70 years is yet to be born,

238
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:39,666
And those who feared questioning

239
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,402
Back in the day

240
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,283
Used to walk on foot.

241
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:46,511
Now, they ride a bike to office.

242
00:16:46,511 --> 00:16:48,948
You have a bike, don't you?

243
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:49,981
Yes?

244
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,468
When are you buying a car?

245
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,652
I mean, how'd you buy one?

246
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:56,402
If you got caught up in questioning,

247
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:59,350
You'd have a 2014 car in 2024,

248
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,355
And I can't guarantee

249
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:05,421
That cars then will run on petrol.

250
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:08,641
That's right, but --
-But what?

251
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,846
Look, Mr Danish,

252
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:11,485
This is a government office.

253
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,922
Someone else will do what you will not.

254
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,283
He may take 150 instead of 100 thousand.

255
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,137
I can give him 200,

256
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:18,671
But it'll work for me.

257
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,157
But what'd you get?

258
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,314
The truth is, you'd laugh

259
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,562
If you heard my problem.

260
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,469
Amuse me.

261
00:17:28,469 --> 00:17:31,096
I mean, tell me your problem.

262
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,422
Back on my first day here,

263
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:36,025
Dad was still alive.

264
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:38,125
Sitting by my side, he said, 'My son',

265
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,173
'Where you're about to start working'

266
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:42,120
'Is an office of the Government.'

267
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,720
'Of the Government, as in, of the nation.'

268
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,830
That's how Dad thought.

269
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,671
Working for the Government was working for the nation,

270
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:50,312
And the Government's money was, to him, the nation's.

271
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:53,251
He said, 'You don't need a pile of money'

272
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:55,866
'Or a lofty position to become a great man',

273
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,745
'But remember -'

274
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,719
'He who plunders a treasure'

275
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,033
'Is no great man'.

276
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,448
I think you didn't quite get it.

277
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:06,891
The Government's money was the nation's to him,

278
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:09,182
And the nation's money was the treasure.

279
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:11,465
He was absolutely right, sir,

280
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,838
But he forgot to tell you one thing:

281
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:18,339
A treasure is something under your watch.

282
00:18:18,408 --> 00:18:20,533
What do <i>you</i> have?

283
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,283
Whatever is it that's under <i>your</i> watch?

284
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,003
Nothing.

285
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,075
The thing you call a treasure

286
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,474
Gets distributed among hundreds

287
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:33,826
Right under your nose,

288
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,363
And <i>you</i> sign its distribution, too.

289
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:37,921
Believe it or not,

290
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:40,174
You can bet your head

291
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:45,813
That you'll sign it but get not a single penny out of 200,000.

292
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,503
But you just said 100,000...

293
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:48,813
I mean --

294
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:51,609
You'd said you'd pay 100,000.

295
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,171
So you were asking for a raise!

296
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:53,982
No...

297
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:55,826
It's nothing like that.

298
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:58,654
I was just reminding you that you'd said 100,000.

299
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:02,628
Alright, mate, my apologies; I'll pay you 200,000.

300
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:10,948
Give me one day.

301
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:12,602
One day?

302
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:15,117
I'll think over it,

303
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:18,744
And if necessary, visit Dad's grave and say,

304
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:21,579
'Your view about the treasure isn't correct.'

305
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,429
Let me know about the boy's fees, too.

306
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,243
The boy's fees?

307
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,344
No -- he hasn't started school yet.

308
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:29,978
But he will one day, right?

309
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:32,443
You'll have to pay the fees then.

310
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,056
Of course.

311
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:35,274
How?

312
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:40,215
Fees for a good school start at 18,000.

313
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:44,234
Hey!

314
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,251
I saw when I went to the mall yesterday

315
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,501
Your necklace is still lying there.

316
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,500
Didn't you buy it?

317
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,640
How would I buy it?

318
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,107
We can save just about a thousand or two from his salary.

319
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,889
Who knows how long it will last!

320
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:01,407
Consider it all spent once Rumi starts school.

321
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,390
Oh...

322
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,014
But I've put this through to him.

323
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:10,311
I've told him how much I like the necklace.

324
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:12,749
What good will that do if you haven't got the money?

325
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:14,859
A lot can happen.

326
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:17,499
I just want him to get rid of his fear.

327
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:20,218
He feels ashamed now,

328
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,705
Or remembers Dad's words.

329
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:25,748
Surely, I'd heard his Dad's no more?

330
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:27,260
But his words aren't.

331
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,859
He's left them well and truly alive for us.

332
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:30,134
Then, put it plainly,

333
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,451
'This is not how one runs a household.'

334
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:33,947
'I'll work too.'

335
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,014
He doesn't agree to it.

336
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,654
Why won't he?

337
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,015
He says, 'What about Rumi?'

338
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:41,341
'Who will take care of him?'

339
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,188
Jeez...

340
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,575
But he's right in saying that.

341
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:50,170
Where'd poor Rumi go if I go to work too?

342
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:54,588
But you know what,

343
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,571
He's determined this time.

344
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,571
He'll do <i>something</i> for sure.

345
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:00,371
Did he say anything?

346
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,010
No.

347
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,682
His eyes did the talking.

348
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:08,219
They clearly said, 'You'll get the necklace at all costs',

349
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:11,979
Even if he has to sell himself.

350
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:28,916
Good afternoon.

351
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,806
Good afternoon.

352
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,492
Show me this necklace, sir.

353
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:32,529
Which one?

354
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:33,601
This green one.

355
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:34,271
Alright.

356
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,895
Show him the green necklace.

357
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:36,836
Sit.

358
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,034
No, I won't sit today.

359
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,731
I've just come to know the price today.

360
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,429
I'll purchase it tomorrow.

361
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,835
103,000.

362
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:46,617
103,000...

363
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,554
See you tomorrow, then.

364
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:49,570
Okay, sure.

365
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,429
Tomorrow.

366
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,261
Goodbye.

367
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:31,273
I've asked the price of the necklace.

368
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:32,669
When?

369
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,304
On my way back from the office today.

370
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:37,788
What good is it?

371
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,250
You'd trouble yourself for nothing.

372
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,796
There.

373
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,281
By the way, how much does it cost?

374
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,953
103,000.

375
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,344
Two months' salary...

376
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,265
Alright, leave the necklace be.

377
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:54,171
Listen to this:

378
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:57,389
A new trouble is upon us.

379
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,437
Pray tell.

380
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:02,421
Anoushay's brother's getting married.

381
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:04,249
We'll be there.

382
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,312
Listen to the whole thing.

383
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:07,583
Ask when the wedding is.

384
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,214
When is it?

385
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:10,496
Friday.

386
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,684
The Dholak's on Wednesday,

387
00:23:11,684 --> 00:23:13,198
And the Mehendi's on Thursday.

388
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:15,825
We have to attend all three.

389
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:17,951
We will, Mehwish.

390
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:21,277
We'll go shopping when I'm back from the office tomorrow.

391
00:23:21,277 --> 00:23:22,969
And I know

392
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,888
Why you're stressing that we have to attend all three.

393
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,687
No problem.

394
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,131
You'll get your three gowns.

395
00:23:31,131 --> 00:23:32,625
You'll get something else, too.

396
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,818
What?

397
00:23:34,818 --> 00:23:36,423
Mum's the word!

398
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:39,266
I'll surprise you tomorrow.

399
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,695
Finish it quickly, now.

400
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:08,448
I'll be back early today.

401
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,452
When?

402
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:11,984
By 2 or 2.30.

403
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,077
How?

404
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,250
You used to say that you can't step outside before 4.30.

405
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,009
Don't you remember when I had to see the doctor last week?

406
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:22,118
Everything changes tomorrow, Mehwish.

407
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:24,571
I'm making friends with the boss.

408
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,743
Splendid.

409
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:27,767
In fact, think as if I've already made friends with him.

410
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:28,542
I just --

411
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,246
Delayed it by one day.

412
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:31,353
Why?

413
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:33,055
When he wants to be friends,

414
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,242
Why keep him waiting?

415
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:37,181
It takes a day, Mehwish, doesn't it,

416
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,416
To step down from one's stature,

417
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,727
Or to accept a friendship with someone above one's stature?

418
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:45,436
It takes a day, at the very least.

419
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:48,376
You didn't ask me why I'd be back at 2.30.

420
00:24:48,376 --> 00:24:50,765
I almost forgot!

421
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:53,030
I'll take you shopping.

422
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,264
Be ready.

423
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:56,862
Finish this,

424
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,519
And I'll get you another paratha.

425
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:02,401
Finish this already.

426
00:25:03,773 --> 00:25:06,039
Here. Have this.

427
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:08,104
One,

428
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:08,694
Two,

429
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:09,384
Three,

430
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:10,514
Four,

431
00:25:10,514 --> 00:25:12,104
Five.

432
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:13,510
Very good.

433
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,569
Have a nice day, Papa.

434
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,411
Here's an idea:

435
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,092
Ask Anoushay

436
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:24,524
Which school Meerab's attending.

437
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,264
Why?

438
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,475
We'll get him enrolled in the school.

439
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:31,732
The rascal spends his entire day watching cartoons.

440
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:34,393
Bad word, Papa.

441
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:37,795
Look at him speak English now.

442
00:25:37,795 --> 00:25:40,107
'Very good, Papa',

443
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:43,311
'Have a nice day, Papa'.

444
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,577
Alright.

445
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:48,310
Do you know the fees for the school?

446
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,735
Must be around 10 to 15 thousand.

447
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,502
And your salary?

448
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:56,543
You do remember how much it is, don't you?

449
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:58,774
48,400.

450
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:03,481
You don't know the power of my signature.

451
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:05,997
Signing a twopenny file

452
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,809
Signs a cheque for 200,000.

453
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,500
See you.

454
00:26:38,447 --> 00:26:40,183
How are you, Danish, mate?

455
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,123
Fine.

456
00:26:41,123 --> 00:26:42,263
And you?

457
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:43,808
I'm fit too.

458
00:26:43,808 --> 00:26:46,262
Tell me about <i>Madame</i>.

459
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:48,318
What <i>about</i> her?

460
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:50,443
How's she?

461
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,210
She's good.

462
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,761
You're going to office?

463
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:58,007
I'm cleaning the plug right now.

464
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:01,317
But you'll be going to office, right?

465
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:02,859
Do you need anything?

466
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:03,677
No.

467
00:27:03,677 --> 00:27:06,147
I was just asking.

468
00:27:06,587 --> 00:27:11,555
Come to our place someday, and bring Madame along.

469
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:13,401
I will, someday.

470
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:14,197
Okay.

471
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:15,102
I'll get going.

472
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,712
Bye.

473
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:20,908
One minute, mate!

474
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,763
Just a second.

475
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,056
Yes?

476
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:27,057
How much does it cost?

477
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,627
What?

478
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,093
Your car.

479
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,764
Would <i>you</i> buy it?

480
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:34,202
I might as well.

481
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,294
Tell me the price.

482
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:40,222
Around 1.2 million.

483
00:27:40,222 --> 00:27:42,314
1.2 million...

484
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:44,126
Is it too much?

485
00:27:44,126 --> 00:27:44,888
No.

486
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,317
Not at all.

487
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,826
Then, let's seal the deal, shall we?

488
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:48,749
No.

489
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:49,521
Not now.

490
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:50,904
In a few days.

491
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:52,608
Just show it to Madame,

492
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:54,128
She'll be delighted.

493
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:54,921
I told you,

494
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:56,389
Not now.

495
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,264
I'm just considering it right now.

496
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:00,826
Don't worry if you don't have the money.

497
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:03,924
An instalment payment will do; just for you.

498
00:28:03,924 --> 00:28:04,950
Buy it.

499
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,060
Madame will be delighted.

500
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,827
I'll talk next month.

501
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:11,607
Sure.

502
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,950
Okay.

503
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,747
I'll get going, mate.

504
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,650
The bugger's always itching to talk about 'Madame'.

505
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,755
What happened?

506
00:29:10,755 --> 00:29:14,567
Why the grim faces?

507
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:17,958
Is it --

508
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,706
Has someone died?

509
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,149
I'll be back to record the statements of every one of you.

510
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:43,514
Please stay here.

511
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:03,864
Not at all.

512
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:07,157
All of <i>them</i> always said, 'Not at all'.

513
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:10,298
I have but one reply to your question:

514
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:11,832
'Not at all'.

515
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,673
Because --
-Because?

516
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:15,408
My Dad used to say,

517
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,281
'Every penny in the possession of the Offices of the Government'

518
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:20,424
'Is the nation's treasure in the possession of the employees',

519
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:22,251
'Never plunder this treasure'.

520
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:23,283
Sounds good.

521
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:27,409
Sounds like your Dad was a wise man.

522
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,147
Your phone's ringing.

523
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:31,855
Wait.

524
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,104
Give me the phone.

525
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,369
My wife's calling.

526
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,338
Don't worry. If it's your wife, I'll let you talk.

527
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:38,227
Here.

528
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,358
Give me the phone.

529
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:45,306
Why aren't you back yet?

530
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:46,524
Look at the time.

531
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:48,447
It's 3.

532
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,885
It's your wife.

533
00:30:49,885 --> 00:30:51,854
Talk to her.

534
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,609
Hello?

535
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:58,811
What did I just ask you?

536
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,513
What?

537
00:31:00,513 --> 00:31:02,499
You'd said you'd be back by 2.

538
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:05,810
I've been ready since 2.

539
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,039
I won't be coming.

540
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,082
What?

541
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:24,190
Will you believe me if I swear on it?

542
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,533
I swear by you I'd forgotten about Dad,

543
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:32,240
And decided to take the money.

544
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,779
In fact, it had been decided

545
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:37,278
That I'd get 200,000 in the first deal.

546
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:38,722
That --

547
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:44,038
That surprise I mentioned, at least ask me what that was.

548
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,642
I was going to get you the necklace.

549
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:46,978
The same one.

550
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:50,503
Or perhaps one even better.

551
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,011
Should I sell the motorcycle?

552
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,493
How would you go to office, then?

553
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,181
That's my problem.

554
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:01,717
There's a bus that goes that way.

555
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:03,181
Leave it be.

556
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:05,650
I'll tell her we can't afford it if she asks me.

557
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,634
Who?

558
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,703
I'm talking about Anoushay.

559
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:11,071
I'd bragged a bit before her when she'd come today.

560
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:14,480
She thinks I can wear anything I like if you want.

561
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,947
Alright, don't worry, I --
-Please.

562
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:20,481
Don't give me any hope now.

563
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:23,435
And don't even talk about selling the motorcycle.

564
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:26,320
It costs no more than 30,000.

565
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,728
Do you remember how much the necklace costs?

566
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:35,980
Get something to eat from the market; I haven't cooked anything.

567
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,860
Go and sit there on the sofa.

568
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,798
Always up to his shenanigans!

569
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:12,086
I've come to realise now, Mehwish,

570
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:14,129
That Dad's words

571
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:18,098
Are of no use in 2019.

572
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:21,301
I've even seen the anti-corruption folks now.

573
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:25,491
I don't fear them anymore.

574
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:27,701
Putting the necklace aside,

575
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:33,155
I'm even thinking of buying Monty's car.

576
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:35,122
What if you got caught?

577
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,231
My boss has been bailed

578
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:40,013
<i>After</i> the courthouse called it a day, at that!

579
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:41,615
When you've made a billion,

580
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:45,061
A million can get you acquitted.

581
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,228
After a week's act of fairness,

582
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,619
Everything will be alright.

583
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:57,440
What will I wear to her brother's wedding?

584
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,500
I mean, I've purchased all three artificial sets with her.

585
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,960
Her brother's getting married in such a haste th --

586
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:09,183
Alright,

587
00:34:09,183 --> 00:34:10,916
What do I do?

588
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:14,513
Selling the motorcycle won't get me enough either.

589
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:17,011
Take out a loan.

590
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:22,308
Don't tell me that Dad had advised you against taking out a loan.

591
00:34:22,308 --> 00:34:24,798
But from whom?

592
00:34:25,012 --> 00:34:27,233
What else are friends for?

593
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:31,168
They'd gladly lend you 80 to 90 thousand in tough times.

594
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,219
I don't have any friend except you.

595
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,542
I never thought I'd need any friend

596
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,986
When I've got you.

597
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:44,683
Tell me,

598
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,291
Have I ever gone to a friend?

599
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,933
I'm only friends with you.

600
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,075
You should, then.

601
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:53,859
Make some friends.

602
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:59,369
The kind that will help you in tough times.

603
00:35:02,132 --> 00:35:04,132
Alright, Rumi,

604
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:07,226
I'll cook you an omelette.

605
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,150
Come.

606
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:37,430
I'd like ha--
-Give me 10 kg of fish, mate.

607
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,810
Give him first.

608
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,680
Sure.

609
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:50,470
Take out a loan.

610
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,825
Don't tell me that Dad had advised you against taking out a loan.

611
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:08,535
How much for you, sir?

612
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:10,693
Half a kilo.

613
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,360
You should, then.

614
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,130
Make some friends.

615
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,709
The kind that will help you in tough times.

616
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:55,694
And here I've brought dinner!

617
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:59,763
Maman's gone to sleep without putting me to sleep.

618
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,401
Have you had anything?

619
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:05,197
I had an omelette with bread.

620
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:06,390
Good.

621
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,728
I'll rouse your Mum, okay?

622
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,260
Mehwish?

623
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,207
Good morning.

624
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:03,327
Good morning.

625
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:07,611
Shall I get you some tea, sir?

626
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:09,627
Yes, please.

627
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:12,066
I wanted to talk to you about something, sir.

628
00:38:12,066 --> 00:38:13,157
Yes?

629
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,347
I would like to take out a loan

630
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:15,347
Of 2,000 Rupees.

631
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:17,097
I can have it deducted from my salary.

632
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:19,376
My wife will be giving birth,

633
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:24,816
And I may have to take her to the hospital any time today.

634
00:38:27,184 --> 00:38:28,123
Why don't you

635
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:29,888
Ask Mr Shams?

636
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,924
He even earns overheads.

637
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:35,328
Those who earn overheads are proper blighters, sir.

638
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:36,952
I'd asked him yesterday,

639
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,243
And he said, 'I'll tell the boss.'

640
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,374
And what about the boss?

641
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:42,702
What about <i>him</i>, sir?

642
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:43,779
He's in his office,

643
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,305
Sipping his coffee.

644
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,461
Alright, wait,

645
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,358
I'll do something.

646
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:53,246
Thank you, sir.

647
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,100
May I come in, sir?

648
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,313
Come in, Mr Danish.

649
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:15,415
What a pleasant surprise, sir!

650
00:39:15,415 --> 00:39:16,682
Surprise?

651
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:18,559
It's a surprise, sir, isn't it,

652
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:22,508
When the anti-corruption folks had taken you yesterday, I'd thought you're...

653
00:39:22,508 --> 00:39:26,325
I was astonished when Shams messaged me at night.

654
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:28,492
You were bailed in two hours!

655
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,540
Because why not, mate?

656
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,853
The anti-corruption folks wrote

657
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:38,617
That they found nothing in the raid.

658
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,172
And how is that, sir?

659
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,838
Six files had been opened before my eyes.

660
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,133
Everything had been done only in the files.

661
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,908
It was nowhere to be found in the city.

662
00:39:46,908 --> 00:39:49,909
They found everything within an hour.

663
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:53,107
The wretch demanded a million from me.

664
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:55,811
I offered him two.

665
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,480
He stopped the car right there,

666
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,608
And said, 'Let's have a cup of tea.'

667
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,180
A -- cup of tea, sir?

668
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,226
Yes.

669
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,823
After tea, he said, 'Go home',

670
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:07,009
'And show yourself'

671
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,853
'Before the Special Magistrate at 1.30.'

672
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:11,430
And guess what,

673
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,307
When I arrived at the Magistrate's office at 1.30,

674
00:40:14,307 --> 00:40:17,232
The same officer opened the door of my car,

675
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:18,691
And said,

676
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:21,420
'Sorry for the inconvenience.'

677
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,716
He was throwing his weight about yesterday,

678
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:27,010
Determined to catch everyone in one day.

679
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,199
The poor souls who won't pay

680
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,215
Will get caught.

681
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,151
So that's it!

682
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:39,168
But I've decided to set an example of honesty for a week.

683
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,365
A week, sir?

684
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:43,277
Why?

685
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:44,649
What is it?

686
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,092
The thing is, sir, when there'd been this thing about the 200,000,

687
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:50,416
I'd promised my wife to get her a necklace.

688
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:52,320
Her friend's brother

689
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,997
Is getting married in two days.

690
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:56,273
She was very worried.

691
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:57,530
Well...

692
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,641
'Well' what?

693
00:40:59,641 --> 00:41:02,643
Keep the promise you've made

694
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:05,862
And get your wife the necklace.

695
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:06,926
But how, sir?

696
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:08,581
My salary --

697
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,399
Call Mr Shams, please.

698
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,673
Wait.

699
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:21,931
Yes, sir?

700
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:22,948
Shams,

701
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:27,853
Transfer 200,000 Rupees to Mr Danish's account.

702
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,056
Actually,

703
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:30,635
Don't transfer it to his account.

704
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:33,384
Give him 200,000 in cash.

705
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:35,230
Alright.

706
00:41:38,383 --> 00:41:39,182
There.

707
00:41:39,182 --> 00:41:41,884
That's all it ever was.
