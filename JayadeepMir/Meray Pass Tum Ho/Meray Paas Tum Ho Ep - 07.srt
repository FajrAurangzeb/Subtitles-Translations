1
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:30,167
Is there any problem?

2
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:31,386
No?

3
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:33,884
Maman's angry.

4
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:35,216
No, she's fine.

5
00:00:35,216 --> 00:00:41,369
I'm honest, Papa. She talks a lot while cooking breakfast.

6
00:00:57,373 --> 00:00:59,127
Ask her.

7
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,033
Maman!

8
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,536
Go on!

9
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:07,204
See that? She said 'Go on'; she usually says, 'Yes'?

10
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,446
What is it?

11
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:20,627
You're angry?

12
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,838
100% she is!

13
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:25,618
C'mon,

14
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,072
Finish it quickly.

15
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,608
What are you doing? Let go!

16
00:01:31,608 --> 00:01:33,262
Listen for a moment.

17
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,712
I don't have any spies.

18
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:38,337
I'd given Mr Nasir a lift the day before yesterday.

19
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:41,187
He lives in #408.

20
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:43,527
The guard said to me before him,

21
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:46,529
'A man who looks like that had come to your flat'.

22
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:50,436
'I left him at your doorstep when he asked me your flat number'.

23
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:57,151
Leave it be.
-I was just angry that you'd not told me.

24
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:00,642
We'll talk after breakfast.

25
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,837
Don't talk about working for him.

26
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,858
Please.

27
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:07,876
I've seen his gaze, Mehwish,

28
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:11,337
And before that, I've seen the world.

29
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:14,650
A man's gaze is his first introduction,

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:20,949
It shows his intentions and what his character's like.

31
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:50,993
Our problem

32
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:54,922
Is finding a good school for Rumi.

33
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:59,117
We don't need a hundred thousand a month for that.

34
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:02,388
You can start working,

35
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:04,272
But work where

36
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:08,169
You get the salary you deserve.

37
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,711
Oh!

38
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,264
Why this 'Oh'?

39
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:14,494
It pains you that I'm earning a hundred thousand.

40
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,899
Are you crazy?

41
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,916
Why would it pain me?

42
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,494
It pains me that I couldn't give you every bit of happiness you desired.

43
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,591
Yet, I didn't take the one million

44
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,014
That I didn't deserve.

45
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:33,617
I'm trying to tell you the same -

46
00:04:33,617 --> 00:04:36,131
The money one deserves

47
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,852
Is his salary, and the money one doesn't deserve

48
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:42,885
Is his price.

49
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,777
Here.

50
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,765
Go and return all of this to him,

51
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,383
And say to him,

52
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,885
'Your gaze is improper, Shehwar Ahmed';

53
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,078
'We can't be friends'.

54
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,003
Go, will you?

55
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:18,499
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:22,583
Before naming my price, we've been paid an advance.

57
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:28,957
Only if you return this will he realise that I'm no item for sale!

58
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,143
I've decided

59
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:42,434
That I won't work.

60
00:05:42,434 --> 00:05:47,170
We'll send Rumi to a school that costs less.

61
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:53,379
Doesn't that make you happy?

62
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,769
You aren't happy either...

63
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,639
This was something to be explained calmly,

64
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,250
But you're saying it angrily.

65
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,162
The same thing's been said, Mehwish,

66
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:07,717
But its meaning has changed.

67
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:09,504
This --

68
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:13,186
These are not gifts.

69
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:14,158
That's why

70
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:17,330
I tremble with fear when wearing this watch.

71
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,706
I swear, when you wear this necklace,

72
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:23,392
You don't look beautiful to me.

73
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,689
Trust me, Mehwish.

74
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,656
These are not gifts.

75
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:31,861
These are scorpions stinging me.

76
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,971
Relax.

77
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:52,544
Danish took the watch and necklace and left for your place.

78
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:53,934
Hey!

79
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:56,603
But why?

80
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,844
He's coming to return them.

81
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:01,736
But why does he want to return them?

82
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,263
What's gotten into him?

83
00:08:04,263 --> 00:08:06,706
He feels your intentions aren't right,

84
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:11,125
That your gaze when you look at me isn't right.

85
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:14,251
He's right about that.

86
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:16,931
I swear, my intentions aren't right.

87
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,183
It's not a joke.

88
00:08:18,183 --> 00:08:20,808
Such words are precisely what anger him.

89
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:24,057
He's also found out that you'd come to meet me the other day.

90
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,123
Not to meet you,

91
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,839
Just to see you.

92
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,653
I haven't thought about meeting you yet.

93
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,464
What would you do now?

94
00:08:31,464 --> 00:08:32,558
What should I do?

95
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:35,619
Let him be told at the gate that you're not home.

96
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,703
I won't do that.

97
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,450
I'll meet him if he comes.

98
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,546
Listen to him, talk to him,

99
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:45,902
And see what he's made of.

100
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,620
Then, you don't know him.

101
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,887
He'd stand his ground before you.

102
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,378
He doesn't know me either.

103
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:55,619
He's coming to challenge my intentions.

104
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,731
I swear by you,

105
00:08:57,731 --> 00:09:01,739
I'll send him back bitterly defeated.

106
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:03,477
Alright, tell me,

107
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,612
Do <i>you</i> feel, too, that my intentions are not right?

108
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,796
That I look at you the wrong way?

109
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,941
Honestly? Sometimes, I feel that too,

110
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,719
But then, I feel it's nothing like that.

111
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:17,029
You're just a good friend.

112
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,547
I'm <i>his</i> friend.

113
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,779
Who are you to me, then?

114
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,029
Pray tell.

115
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:26,805
When I first saw you,

116
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,685
My heart asked,

117
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,586
Why are you someone else's?

118
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:35,304
I had to tell my heart the next time I met you,

119
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:38,968
Quiet it like one would a child, explain to it

120
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:41,542
That you're not a toy

121
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:45,448
That I can buy and keep with me.

122
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,529
And when you came to dinner,

123
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:49,417
It felt as if

124
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:54,761
Someone from the Heavens had descended into my heart.

125
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,853
I remembered you after you left,

126
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:00,465
And fell asleep, thinking

127
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:05,992
That fairies do not visit barren wastelands.

128
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,097
If these words make you think that my intentions aren't right,

129
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:14,645
I'll say to him today,

130
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,832
'But of course, Mr Danish',

131
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:20,132
'My intentions are not right'.

132
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,070
Why are you quiet?

133
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,934
Please, go on.

134
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,352
Isn't he there yet?

135
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,106
No.

136
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,498
May I request something?

137
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,798
You'd request me?

138
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:53,920
Hey!

139
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,096
Just order me.

140
00:10:56,096 --> 00:11:01,457
Just don't say, 'My intentions aren't right'.

141
00:11:01,457 --> 00:11:02,928
I won't.

142
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,785
Don't worry.

143
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:06,928
And if he shouts, just listen.

144
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,677
He'd shout?

145
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:10,379
Normally, he doesn't,

146
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,338
But he gets furious if someone brings me up when talking.

147
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:15,198
Splendid.

148
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:16,527
I'd have proper fun.

149
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:18,979
You won't have fun, you'd be enraged.

150
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,693
He may get very foul,

151
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:23,915
And if you say anything in return, things will only heat up.

152
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:27,080
Please don't do that.

153
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,050
Just a minute.

154
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,391
Alright.

155
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:41,875
Have him sit;

156
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,201
Tell him I'm coming.

157
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:48,732
He's here.

158
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,283
Good Lord!

159
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:51,641
Don't worry.

160
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:54,171
Just remember that I'd send him bitterly defeated.

161
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,514
May God will so!

162
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,073
Trust me,

163
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,747
He'd come back wearing the watch,

164
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:02,199
Saying,

165
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:03,856
'I'm sorry, Mehwish',

166
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,294
'But I was wrong'.

167
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:08,921
'His intentions weren't bad'.

168
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,091
Come.

169
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,134
Please, sit.

170
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,726
He'll be here shortly.

171
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:42,045
What would you like to have? Tea, or a cold drink?

172
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,516
Nothing.

173
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:44,913
That's not possible.

174
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:49,268
If he found out, he'd be angry with me.

175
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:54,422
Get me a glass of cold water, then.
-In a moment, sir.

176
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,361
What a pleasant surprise, Mr Danish!

177
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:08,771
This Sunday was such a put-off!

178
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:10,738
Please, sit.

179
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:12,862
How are you?

180
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,395
I'm fine.

181
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,302
Did you have anything?

182
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:17,761
I've asked for some water.

183
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:20,395
You'd just have water at your friend's house?

184
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:23,892
That's brilliant, Mr Danish!

185
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,019
You may leave.

186
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,863
Here.

187
00:13:29,863 --> 00:13:31,444
Thank you.

188
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,251
Why didn't Mehwish come?

189
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:36,202
There, now!

190
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:38,295
I've complimented her in every way imaginable,

191
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:40,280
But it didn't seem to have had any effect on her.

192
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,610
I thought

193
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,380
She'd say to you herself,

194
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,018
'Let's go to Mr Shehwar's place'.

195
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:52,202
Someone had once said that to win a woman's heart,

196
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:54,733
Compliment her.

197
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,187
In fact, say it plainly,

198
00:13:57,187 --> 00:14:00,630
'No one can be more beautiful than you'.

199
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,688
I thought she'd be chuffed to hear,

200
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:09,186
And I wouldn't have to invite you here.

201
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:12,260
That's alright, but --
-What's alright, Mr Danish?

202
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,748
Rumi had come the other day.

203
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:16,683
He watched a film in the theatre,

204
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:19,436
Had fun in the lawn;

205
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,378
We had dinner together;

206
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,342
I felt that

207
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,982
I wasn't alone.

208
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,753
Remember

209
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:35,186
How lively this place had been?

210
00:14:35,186 --> 00:14:37,208
I was prancing about

211
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,717
As if you'd never go back,

212
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,124
As if the four of us are family,

213
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:45,069
As if we're all bound to each other,

214
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,392
And then...

215
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:49,470
You left,

216
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,625
And I --

217
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:57,350
I swear, this very house stung at me when you'd left.

218
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,550
Please, have your juice.

219
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:07,725
Call Madame and tell her you're having lunch with me.

220
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,785
I won't hear a no, Mr Danish.

221
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,862
Please.

222
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,898
Mr Diwan!

223
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:19,159
Serve us lunch.

224
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,759
Has he fallen asleep?

225
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,988
I've told him 10 different tales.

226
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,549
He fell asleep after the 10th one.

227
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,214
He was asking,

228
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:50,199
'Where are the <i>djinns</i>, Papa'?

229
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,890
'Why haven't you shown me one'?

230
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:55,961
What are you reading?

231
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,136
Nothing, really.

232
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,682
I thought I'd read this magazine while waiting for you.

233
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:02,481
Anoushay had given me this one.

234
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:05,871
Should I turn off the lights?
-No...

235
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,059
I don't feel sleepy.

236
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,899
It's 1, Danish.

237
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,322
Let it be.

238
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:17,367
Do you know, it pains me so much...

239
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,398
I'm cursing myself.

240
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:21,963
What happened?

241
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,589
You haven't asked what happened there.

242
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,915
I went there in fury,

243
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,868
And have come back as soft as wax.

244
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,871
What'd happened there?

245
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:36,400
He'd said so much before I could utter a single word!

246
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,742
There was sorrow and truthfulness in his words,

247
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:42,680
I was pained to hear it, Mehwish.

248
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,398
I forgot that I'd gone there for a reason.

249
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:52,793
I'd gone, thinking I'd break his face if he said anything dodgy.

250
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:56,103
But I was left looking at his face quietly.

251
00:16:56,103 --> 00:17:00,946
He defeated me without even fighting.

252
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:03,776
Trust me, coming back from there,

253
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,795
I felt like

254
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:09,463
I was a warrior who'd faced defeat.

255
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,265
Everything I'd thought turned out to be wrong, Mehwish.

256
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,291
<i>I was wrong.</i>

257
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,524
His intentions aren't bad,

258
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:20,326
Nor is his gaze wrong.

259
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,811
Alright, go to sleep; you have to go to office in the morning.

260
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,869
Listen, please.

261
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,619
They'll be divorced very soon.

262
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,952
Who?

263
00:17:27,952 --> 00:17:31,118
Shehwar and his wife.
-Oh.

264
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,510
Shehwar worked at her office before he married her.

265
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,655
He was her employee.

266
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,528
And she used to treat him as her servant after their marriage, too.

267
00:17:39,528 --> 00:17:42,480
She was rather foolish, really.

268
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:45,353
What do we know what went on behind the scenes?

269
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:48,935
Looking into his eyes, one can see that the poor man's lonely.

270
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,510
He misses her a lot.

271
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:52,697
And she --

272
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,718
She's gadding about in America.

273
00:17:56,718 --> 00:17:59,720
I've said, 'You should get married'.

274
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,654
As in, 'Marry a second'?

275
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:02,401
Hey!

276
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,309
As if his first marriage's anything like a marriage!

277
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:08,232
What did he say?

278
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:09,684
Nothing.

279
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:13,179
He just laughed it off.

280
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,915
He said, 'Let me know if there's someone like Mehwish'.

281
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:20,577
'Only then would I get married'.

282
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,842
I realised, then,

283
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:27,529
That I tell the truth.

284
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:28,938
What truth?

285
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:32,357
That I don't have a grand job,

286
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:33,672
Mansion,

287
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:36,543
Or car,

288
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:41,157
Nor a bank balance like Shehwar's,

289
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:44,906
But I've got <i>Mehwish</i>.

290
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,620
I've got you, Mehwish.

291
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,938
Have you prepared your CV?

292
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,887
No?

293
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,043
I thought you would've.

294
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,609
What'd I do with a CV?

295
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,337
Start applying, of course.

296
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:15,767
Go to his office, now.

297
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:19,090
Give him your CV and get your appointment letter.

298
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:19,763
You --

299
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:21,982
You're talking about Mr Shehwar?

300
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:24,510
Of course, I'm talking about him.

301
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,559
Go.

302
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,181
It's a good opportunity offering a good salary.

303
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:31,516
And I have no problem.

304
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,542
Sure?

305
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:36,344
200%.

306
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,856
Where do I leave Rumi?

307
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,590
Why, with Anoushay.

308
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,497
It's just about today.

309
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:44,744
We can

310
00:19:44,744 --> 00:19:48,353
Hire a maid tomorrow.

311
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:54,071
What are you looking at?

312
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,179
You're happy, aren't you?

313
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:57,677
What does it look like?

314
00:19:57,677 --> 00:19:59,556
Looks like you are, but

315
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,959
If you got angry over something again...

316
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,288
I would never get angry now.

317
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,529
I promise.

318
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:10,398
Go and get me my bag, will you?

319
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:31,754
Now, don't boss over me.

320
00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:34,021
Why would I boss over you?

321
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,864
You'd be getting a hundred thousand a month.

322
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:39,102
You may start acting proud.

323
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:42,052
You're getting jealous, aren't you?

324
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:44,252
Get going, now.

325
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,933
Hold on. Just a moment.

326
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,630
Here.

327
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,295
Bye!

328
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:00,853
Bye.

329
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I'm headed for the office, sir!

330
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:01,929
Good morning, Mr Danish.

331
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:03,347
Good morning, sir.

332
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:04,394
Please, Mr Danish,

333
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:07,129
Surely, <i>you</i> wouldn't call me 'Sir'!

334
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:09,535
I'd have to, sir.

335
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,393
When Mehwish would call you 'sir',

336
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:13,991
I'd have to, too.

337
00:23:14,223 --> 00:23:15,130
What do you mean?

338
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,006
She'd be coming to your office today

339
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:19,807
To start working.

340
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,386
Oh!

341
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,258
When should she come?

342
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:25,898
I'm just leaving for office.

343
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:28,569
Tell her to come now.

344
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,895
One more thing, sir.

345
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:31,903
Yes?

346
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:34,814
If she could be picked up and dropped for a few days,

347
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,504
It'd ease me.

348
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:38,193
Why just a few days?

349
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:42,347
When you request me, Mr Danish, it feels as if you're insulting me.

350
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:43,925
No...

351
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,739
I wouldn't dare imagine.

352
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,819
Then however did you imagine that she'd have any problem

353
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,787
About coming and going back if she were to work for me?

354
00:23:53,787 --> 00:23:55,348
Don't worry,

355
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:58,366
She's my responsibility now.

356
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,812
Thank you, sir.

357
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:02,005
Thank you so much.

358
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,557
My pleasure.

359
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:04,553
Bye.

360
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:06,660
Bye, sir.

361
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,218
She'd be having breakfast right now...

362
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,961
Are we going somewhere, Maman?

363
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:39,327
Yes.

364
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,102
You to Aunt Anoushay's,

365
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,163
And I to office.

366
00:24:43,163 --> 00:24:45,307
You'd go to office, too?

367
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:47,055
Yes.

368
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:48,245
So would I --

369
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,352
Everyday --

370
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:52,351
Be -- Stay at Aunt Anousay's?

371
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:53,320
No.

372
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,105
You're starting school tomorrow,

373
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:58,601
And until I'm back, you'd be with our maid.

374
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,261
Where's the maid?

375
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:02,007
She'd be here, mun.

376
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:04,179
Get a move on, now. Don't ask so many questions.

377
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,430
I would ask you.

378
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:13,309
Yes, Danish?

379
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:14,885
Had breakfast?

380
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,381
Yes.

381
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,506
Alright,

382
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:20,571
I've talked to Mr Shehwar.

383
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:21,488
About what?

384
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:24,613
About you working at his office.

385
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,370
In fact, I've even talked about picking and dropping you,

386
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:30,210
And he's agreed to arrange for it.

387
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,618
Think again, Danish.

388
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:33,355
What's left to think about?

389
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:35,036
You're happy, aren't you?

390
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:37,380
I swear, I'm very happy.

391
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,339
I was just thinking of how you'd go and come.

392
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:44,551
That's been sorted out, too, now.

393
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,413
So, when should I go?

394
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:48,604
Today.

395
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:50,183
In fact, go right away.

396
00:25:50,183 --> 00:25:51,254
Should I get ready?

397
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:52,526
Yes.

398
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,566
Just text me as you're leaving.

399
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:56,708
Also, is Rumi up?

400
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,303
He got up a while ago.

401
00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,831
Give him the phone.

402
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:02,492
I'll tell him not to bother you.

403
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:04,208
Just focus on your work, will you?

404
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,785
I'll explain it to him.

405
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,383
Okay, then,

406
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:09,663
Bye.

407
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:11,587
Bye.

408
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:22,854
You didn't even tell me this thing about working at Mr Shehwar's office, mate!

409
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:24,010
What could I tell you?

410
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,113
I didn't know what Danish would say until the last moment.

411
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,715
Then?

412
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,292
No idea how he agreed to it today.

413
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,451
He called from his office when he got there.

414
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,589
He said, 'Go'.

415
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:38,296
Would you look at how you've decked yourself up!

416
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:42,808
Would you do your work, or kill with those looks!

417
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,442
Alright,

418
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:47,148
I'm leaving Rumi with you today.

419
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,942
Just for today.

420
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,309
Tomorrow, I'll hire a maid,

421
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:54,537
And I won't have to bother you.
-No problem, mate.

422
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:57,719
Alright, I'll pick him up on my way back.

423
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:00,267
Okay, no problem.

424
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,373
Rumi,

425
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:02,190
I'm leaving.

426
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,920
Don't bother Aunt too much.

427
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,876
Bye!

428
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,516
Alright.

429
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:11,410
Tell me,

430
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,202
Is that necklace a real one?

431
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:15,263
Of course,

432
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:16,875
It's a real one.

433
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,514
Then,

434
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:21,942
How could Danish's salary have gotten you that?

435
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:26,539
When did I say Danish got me that?

436
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:28,039
Bye.

437
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:08,738
Hey!

438
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:14,729
I'm feeling dizzy.

439
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:16,608
Dizzy?

440
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:18,015
No --

441
00:28:18,015 --> 00:28:20,184
I think I have a headache.

442
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,391
Do you have a head pil --

443
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,764
I mean, a pill for the headache?

444
00:28:23,764 --> 00:28:25,185
Yes, I can get you one.

445
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:27,627
Just a moment!

446
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,757
You've built me up.

447
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:52,257
All the companies of the group are profiting because of you.

448
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:59,023
I just come to the office, sit on my chair, sip my tea, and go back.

449
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:05,741
Shut up!

450
00:29:05,741 --> 00:29:08,790
You're here for two months a year,

451
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,914
Doing the numbers for one and a half,

452
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:15,849
And spending the other 15 days encashing cheques for yourself.

453
00:29:15,849 --> 00:29:18,728
What else do you do?

454
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:22,742
I have given <i>your</i> business <i>my</i> life blood.

455
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:23,885
Actually,

456
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:26,165
There should be a 1:6 ratio

457
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:29,850
Between your assets and mine.

458
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:32,437
I work for 12 months,

459
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,422
And you for 2,

460
00:29:35,422 --> 00:29:38,281
But unlike you,

461
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:43,702
I remember people's favours on me.

462
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,755
Yes?

463
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,426
Ms Mehwish is here, sir.

464
00:29:51,426 --> 00:29:53,163
So, send her to me.

465
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:55,006
Okay, sir.

466
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,210
Come.

467
00:29:58,193 --> 00:30:00,881
You are busy with your numbers whenever you're here, right?

468
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:05,783
About the money, the accounts, the assets?

469
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:06,601
So,

470
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:11,274
When you come this time, do the numbers about those five years of my life, too,

471
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,136
And tell me

472
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,381
Which of the group's profit

473
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:19,381
And my life's loss is the greater.

474
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,750
Okay, I have to go now.

475
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,617
I have to attend a very important meeting.

476
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:31,209
Why are you standing?

477
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:32,315
Please, sit.

478
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,006
Alright.

479
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,496
You're looking gorgeous.

480
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:52,339
Everything's alright now, innit?

481
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:57,044
He came back wearing the watch yesterday, right?

482
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:58,811
Yes.

483
00:31:05,337 --> 00:31:07,669
What's the date today?

484
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,949
It's the 16th, right?

485
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:11,714
Yes.

486
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,309
I would never forget

487
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,877
The 16th of September.

488
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,841
I'd write in my diary,

489
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:29,239
'She came to my office for the first time on the 16th'.

490
00:31:33,752 --> 00:31:35,919
Here's your appointment letter.

491
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,947
Thank you.

492
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:48,737
I've signed someone's appointment letter myself after long.

493
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:52,921
There's also a cheque for me.

494
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:57,003
That's five months' salary in advance.

495
00:31:58,023 --> 00:32:02,370
Just live the way you are.

496
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:06,807
I've also given you a car and a driver.

497
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:11,693
Don't say anything.

498
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:16,101
You deserve all of it.

499
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,020
Come, I'll show you your office.

500
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:35,994
I'm feeling dizzy, sir.

501
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:38,878
I have a headache, too.

502
00:32:38,878 --> 00:32:41,613
I took a pill, sir, but it isn't getting better.

503
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:42,799
So?

504
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,908
I was thinking it's --

505
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:47,267
Better if I could get a leave.

506
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,614
A half day's leave.

507
00:32:48,614 --> 00:32:49,613
Okay,

508
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:51,142
You may take a leave.

509
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:52,603
Thank you sir.

510
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,991
Thank you very much, sir.

511
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,917
This is your room.

512
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,069
How is it?

513
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:31,368
Beautiful.

514
00:33:31,368 --> 00:33:32,823
But...

515
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,853
But what?

516
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:37,699
This letter mentions neither my designation

517
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:41,319
Nor what I have to do.

518
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,203
Tell me,

519
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:45,637
What'd you do?

520
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,793
I should tell you?

521
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,573
Before you came, I was thinking about what you'd do,

522
00:33:52,573 --> 00:33:54,152
But I figured

523
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:55,744
Everyone's going about their job, right?

524
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:58,201
Let them.

525
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,352
How say you change things a bit?

526
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:06,225
How?
-Don't do your job!

527
00:34:06,743 --> 00:34:10,767
Just stay with me.

528
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:12,361
Come to me

529
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,555
When I want,

530
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,868
And remind me

531
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,490
That I haven't had lunch,

532
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,841
That I haven't had coffee.

533
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,620
I smoke a couple of cigarettes

534
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,299
When my wife calls me.

535
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,398
Don't give me a cigarette.

536
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,040
The doctor's told me not to smoke.

537
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:36,708
So it was your wife right now!

538
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,223
What did she say?

539
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:42,642
Nothing.

540
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,350
Hey!

541
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,720
You won't smoke.

542
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,354
May I have coffee?

543
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,985
Yes.

544
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,669
Maria!

545
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,792
Please, get me some coffee.

546
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,200
You're doing your duty, right?

547
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,744
What duty?

548
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:15,245
Stopping me from smoking,

549
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:17,666
Allowing me to have coffee...

550
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:19,390
Whatever you say,

551
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,515
I won't let you smoke.

552
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:24,140
Why are you leaving?

553
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,326
My --

554
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:27,201
Cellphone's in the room;

555
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:30,110
What if Danish called?
-So what?

556
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,511
One doesn't have the time

557
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:36,154
To answer a phone when at work.

558
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,717
Alright.

559
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,483
I'm afraid.

560
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,936
Why are you afraid?

561
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:45,637
I will develop a habit of it -

562
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:48,699
You telling me not to smoke,

563
00:36:48,699 --> 00:36:51,998
Pulling the cigarette from my mouth and throwing it in the dustbin,

564
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:55,276
Seeing you,

565
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:57,469
Being with you...

566
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:00,011
I'm right here, with you.

567
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:03,094
You're doing a job.

568
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:06,541
Who knows, one of these days, he may get angry and stop you,

569
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,218
And you may resign and leave.

570
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:11,198
I would never leave.

571
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:15,186
He can't stop me now.

572
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:27,616
Sorry, mate.

573
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,182
Sorry.

574
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,601
Are you blind?

575
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:03,599
Even if I am, can't you see?

576
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,164
Don't stay put; Get a move on once the signal's turned green.

577
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:08,271
Don't you know how to talk to girls?

578
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:09,883
Do you know how to talk to boys?

579
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:13,491
You think of yourself as a boy?

580
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:16,916
Have some shame.

581
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,823
Why are you arguing, old fella? The fault is yours.

582
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:24,168
So I'm an 'old fella' to you, too!

583
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,401
Look at your own age! Get going.

584
00:38:26,401 --> 00:38:29,087
Mind your own business.

585
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,655
So, what do you do

586
00:38:34,655 --> 00:38:37,433
When she calls you at night?

587
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,244
Smoke a cigarette.

588
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:41,041
Not good.

589
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,294
What do I do?

590
00:38:43,294 --> 00:38:46,561
Do you know what her tone's like?

591
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:48,531
You'd be inflamed to hear it.

592
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:50,787
It pains me to hear it.

593
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,920
Back when I didn't smoke,

594
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,626
I'd vent my anger on any employee.

595
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,936
I'd curse myself later -

596
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:02,563
'What was his fault'?

597
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:04,907
Just -- Don't answer her call.

598
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:06,270
I have to.

599
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,001
She's my business partner.

600
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:11,908
I want it all to end.

601
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:15,111
I want to live in peace, Mehwish,

602
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:18,128
Or rest in peace.

603
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:20,484
Please, sir.

604
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:23,144
Anyway,

605
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:26,232
This will go on at least until December.

606
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:29,859
Besides, December isn't all that far away.
-What's her problem?

607
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:33,552
If the business is doing well, why isn't life going on smoothly?

608
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:36,284
I know what the problem is,

609
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:39,094
But I can't tell anyone.

610
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:43,281
I feel ashamed to utter such a thing.

611
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,329
Okay, no problem...

612
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,046
What'd I do with it?

613
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,034
Right...

614
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:53,953
Whatever would you do with it?

615
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,753
What's this pill for?

616
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:12,957
Nothing really... I just have a slight headache...

617
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,409
I'm boring you, right?

618
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:18,532
No, not at all.

619
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,324
You may leave.

620
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:24,118
Go back to your room.

621
00:40:24,118 --> 00:40:25,681
We'll meet again

622
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:27,099
When I get better.

623
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,417
No.

624
00:40:28,417 --> 00:40:32,443
I'll leave only when you get better.

625
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,131
What are you made of, really!

626
00:40:37,131 --> 00:40:40,408
Ordering around like this suits you.

627
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:44,408
Where were you all these years?

628
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
English translation: J. Mir
