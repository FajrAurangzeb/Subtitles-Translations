1
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:04,183
Come.

2
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,393
Hey!

3
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:06,596
What happened to you?

4
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:10,345
Were you playing cricket, Papa?

5
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:18,408
Why did you go with him?

6
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:20,658
He was insisting so much...

7
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:23,549
So you'd go along with anyone who'd insist?

8
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:24,768
Are you in your senses?

9
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,699
I'm not in my senses, Mehwish.

10
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,768
How could you sit in the car with another man without your husband's permission?

11
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,834
He said he's your friend, and that makes me like his sister-in-law...

12
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,672
When did I say he's my friend?

13
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,048
And even if I did,

14
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:39,979
You should ask me before sitting with my friend.

15
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,861
Okay, it was a mistake.

16
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,344
Won't do it again.

17
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,173
'Won't do it again', as in?

18
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:47,142
Is it so simple for you?

19
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:48,814
Don't make it difficult, Danish.

20
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:51,971
Goodness knows what's happened to you suddenly.
-What's happened?

21
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,641
Don't speak, blood is gushing out from your mouth!

22
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,053
Not gushing --

23
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,532
It's stinging at me.

24
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:58,643
I'm stung.

25
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,710
And you're saying something's suddenly happened to <i>me</i>.

26
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,174
I say something's suddenly happened to <i>you</i>.

27
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,579
What is going on?

28
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:06,353
One, you'd say 'Yes' in good temper,

29
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,161
Two, you'd give in to insistence.

30
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,408
Tell me,

31
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:13,112
How do you think you're an upright woman?

32
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,596
Am I not an upright woman?
-You are.

33
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,611
Very upright, in fact.

34
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,216
But what you're doing is not right.

35
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,566
If I got in the car with someone in a moment's daftness,

36
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,164
Or danced for two minutes with someone to please him,

37
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:27,902
What's wrong with that?

38
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,403
Do you even know what you're saying?

39
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,665
That's not reason; it's just wayward stubbornness.

40
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:37,278
An upright woman has the courage to stand up to another man's flattery,

41
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:42,342
And to refuse his offer despite his insistence.

42
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,897
And a woman who doesn't have the courage to refuse

43
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:48,117
Is no woman at all.

44
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,200
She's not a woman.

45
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:25,880
What?

46
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,496
He's sleeping.

47
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,330
Go and watch TV.

48
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,645
Again?

49
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:35,346
Yes, go and watch your cartoon.

50
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,533
Alright, get up now.

51
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:58,060
We have to go to the wedding.

52
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,455
I promise you

53
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:05,722
That I won't make such a mistake again.

54
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,019
How could I go?

55
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:11,596
Can you see this bruise?

56
00:05:11,596 --> 00:05:13,331
Yes, you didn't tell me --

57
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,893
How did you get this?

58
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:17,523
Monty's punch.

59
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:22,753
The bugger hit me.

60
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:25,133
Well, I hit him, too,

61
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,767
But his punch worked.

62
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,235
But why?

63
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:29,782
Why did the two of you fight?

64
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:31,540
Because of you.

65
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,143
I got hold of him just as he came.

66
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:37,364
I asked him why he took my wife along.

67
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:39,008
He said, 'I didn't abduct her'.

68
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:40,855
'She went willingly'.

69
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,161
Would you look at how he's twisting everything!

70
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,909
Didn't he tell you how much he was insisting?

71
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,643
He didn't,

72
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:50,579
But he did say, 'Your wife's lovely',

73
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,196
'And you can't control her'.

74
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,897
Good Lord!

75
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,127
The blighter!

76
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:58,080
I swear by you, my head sunk with shame.

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,502
He said he's like my brother-in-law!

78
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:04,751
He got me with his sweet words.

79
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:06,266
I told you,

80
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,687
I won't make this mistake again.

81
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,240
Get up, now.

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,201
I will get up, Mehwish.

83
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,409
But how would I go?

84
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:15,304
This --

85
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:18,865
Is this the kind of face to show at a wedding?

86
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,613
We'd have to go, though, Danish.

87
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,634
I've got just got one friend. What would she think?

88
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:25,926
She's already angry that we'd left the Mehendi.

89
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,927
You go, then.

90
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,052
Alone?

91
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:31,425
No...

92
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,301
Take Rumi along.

93
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:37,411
How could I leave you?

94
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,325
Do we ever leave each other?

95
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,057
Even when I go to the office,

96
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:44,940
I have you sit right by my side.

97
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,582
And when nobody's listening,

98
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:49,840
I talk to you, too!

99
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:55,803
You wouldn't feel bad about it, would you?

100
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,938
Why should I?

101
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,728
<i>He</i>'d be there, too.

102
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:03,030
So what?

103
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,297
When a woman gathers the courage to refuse,

104
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:09,000
She may go wherever she wants to.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,485
Nobody can conquer her.

106
00:07:16,362 --> 00:07:18,117
How would you go?

107
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:19,249
I'll ask Anoushay.

108
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,591
She'll send a car.

109
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:23,843
She'd pick me up and drop me.

110
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,840
Perfect.

111
00:09:25,853 --> 00:09:27,167
Meet Aunt Anoushay, okay?

112
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,419
Greet Meerab too.

113
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,398
Hello!

114
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:42,975
Hello! How are you?
-Alright.

115
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,654
Where's Danish?

116
00:09:44,654 --> 00:09:46,569
He didn't come.

117
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,366
Why?

118
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:51,989
He got into a row with someone from the building over me.

119
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,428
He punched him.

120
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,834
He has such a large bruise!

121
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,180
Oh my...

122
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,040
Good evening! How are you?

123
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,400
Everything good? Thank you so much for coming.

124
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,610
Hi beautiful.

125
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,960
Hi.

126
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,116
Apologies for yesterday.

127
00:10:23,116 --> 00:10:24,838
Apologies, as in?

128
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:29,745
I danced with you and it enraged your husband.

129
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:32,489
I'm apologising for that.

130
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,737
Where is he, though?

131
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:38,629
I've come to make friends with him today.

132
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:39,678
He hasn't come.

133
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:42,020
He's unwell.

134
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,393
Right.

135
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,784
It seemed so yesterday.

136
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:50,554
I think he shouldn't be out on the roads either.

137
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,816
Why?

138
00:10:51,816 --> 00:10:53,894
Don't you know?

139
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:57,430
He almost came under my car last night.

140
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,737
What?

141
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:00,638
Your car?
-C'mon, now, Mehwish,

142
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:04,987
It's almost time for the nuptials; we can talk later; come!

143
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,717
You didn't tell me

144
00:12:34,717 --> 00:12:36,498
What you do.

145
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:38,206
You never asked me,

146
00:12:38,206 --> 00:12:40,271
So I thought I'd keep it under wraps.

147
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:42,001
Why, mate?

148
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:43,583
The thing is...

149
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,302
Look at what you are, and look what I am...

150
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,724
Why, what are you?

151
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,004
I'm --

152
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,590
An insignificant officer of the local government office.

153
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,911
Oh?

154
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:56,025
You must be having the time of your life, then!

155
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,380
I get it now.

156
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,068
You haven't brought your car

157
00:12:59,068 --> 00:13:03,307
So one can't know how the times have been for you!
-No, Mr Shehwar...

158
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,051
I don't have a car.

159
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,022
The thing is,

160
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:13,115
I don't earn anything above my salary.

161
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,229
You're laughing?

162
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,743
I start laughing when I can't believe something.

163
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:23,596
But, looking at you, I can begin to believe it.

164
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:26,806
I swear to God I've never taken a bribe.

165
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,416
If I so much as think abou it, Dad shows up.

166
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,339
Your father works there, too?

167
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,544
No.

168
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,618
Dad's no more.
-Oh...

169
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:38,573
His memory lives on.

170
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,800
When I'd first gone to the office, he told me,

171
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,883
'Do you know'

172
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,670
'Why our country isn't going forward?'

173
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,650
Surely, Mr Danish, it is?
-He used to think it's not.

174
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,933
He'd say,

175
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:52,097
'One can't march forward'

176
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,984
'In the swamps of bribery'.

177
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,134
'Sometimes, we stop; sometimes, we trip and fall.'

178
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,937
That's what's happening ever since.

179
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:02,166
I fear the slightest chance to take a bribe.

180
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,880
It feels as if

181
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,243
I'm mired

182
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,139
Up to my ankles.

183
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,618
Don't you believe it?
-No.

184
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,622
For the first time, I'm laughing

185
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:16,479
When I can believe it.

186
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:05,002
Your husband is very simple, Mrs Danish.

187
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,509
Meeting him, one grows fond of him.

188
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,416
Anything, really!

189
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,274
No,

190
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm honest.

191
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,571
Thank you so much.

192
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:14,993
Please, pay me a visit sometime.

193
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:16,890
We'll have dinner together.

194
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,248
Sure.
-9 p.m. tomorrow?

195
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:22,494
No -- tomorrow --
-What is it tomorrow?

196
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,947
Are you busy?

197
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,306
Why, Mrs Danish?

198
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:31,430
Are you busy tomorrow night?

199
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,613
No,

200
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:35,485
We're not busy...

201
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:38,097
But --
-The night after?

202
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:40,051
Then, the night after tomorrow?

203
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,114
9 p.m.

204
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:45,253
Oh, well --

205
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,256
We'll come someday...

206
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:49,708
Why not the night after tomorrow?

207
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,161
Or is it that

208
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:54,019
You don't truly accept my friendship?

209
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,209
No, it's nothing like that.

210
00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:57,819
I've accepted your friendship.

211
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:03,004
If you've accepted my friendship, why not accept this invitation too?

212
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,707
Why don't you say something, Mrs Danish?

213
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,179
Okay, fine.

214
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:10,995
The night after tomorrow it is.

215
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,498
Just stop here. Our flat's here.

216
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:18,939
Here?
-Yes.

217
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,380
It's Anoushay.

218
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:13,509
Hello?

219
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:16,472
The two of you went in the car with Mr Shehwar?

220
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:17,275
Yes.

221
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,979
They're friends now.

222
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:20,886
Danish just couldn't refuse.

223
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,540
Right...

224
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,416
It was just yesterday that it seemed as if he'd grab his collar!

225
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,682
It's quite natural, Anoushay.

226
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:30,132
Who knows what one's like at first?

227
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,547
It's only after meeting that one realises that one could be like Mr Shehwar!

228
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:34,832
He's a very nice man.

229
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:37,526
Is that <i>he</i> saying that, or

230
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:40,025
Is it just you?

231
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,463
Didn't I tell you they're friends now?

232
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,761
Oh, they talk about such interesting things!

233
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,352
Smiling and laughing all the time.

234
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,196
Yes.

235
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:50,493
Yes...

236
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:53,267
But deep down, the poor man's a sad soul.

237
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:54,757
Why?

238
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,918
His wife, mate...

239
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,413
Good Lord!

240
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,521
That woman's a witch!

241
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:03,271
The two of them have been separated for 5 years.

242
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,192
Hey!

243
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:07,381
Alright,

244
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,485
I'm going now.

245
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,354
Good night.

246
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,205
Okay,

247
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,376
Good night.

248
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:13,970
She must be asking if we're back.

249
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,142
Yes.

250
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,923
She was a bit surprised too.

251
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,579
Why was she surprised?

252
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:24,058
She couldn't believe that we'd come back in Mr Shehwar's car.

253
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:25,362
You should've told her

254
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:28,500
We're good friends now.

255
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:30,940
Come, it's 2.30 already.

256
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,206
Yes, just a second.

257
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,262
No, how could I miss the event?

258
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:40,870
Honestly, I don't like it one bit

259
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,902
That you

260
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:43,764
Are calling me at 2 a.m.

261
00:18:43,764 --> 00:18:47,699
On the day of your wedding rites.

262
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:50,010
Go to her, she must be waiting for you.

263
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,777
Good night.

264
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,249
Why are you coming?

265
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:56,841
Go and rest.

266
00:18:56,841 --> 00:19:00,361
Okay, good night, sir.
-Good night.

267
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:14,182
Water's dripping from the AC again...

268
00:19:15,353 --> 00:19:17,653
You're up?

269
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:23,719
I was remembering the wedding celebrations.

270
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,685
I'd seen a lot.

271
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:32,290
People spend money like they're mad these days.

272
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,255
A hundred gowns for the bride,

273
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,911
15 for the family,

274
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:41,082
And they also had 5 for the servants.

275
00:19:41,082 --> 00:19:42,255
Splendid.

276
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,536
And guess what,

277
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:47,787
Even the servants' gowns cost no less than 7,000.

278
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,224
Alright, go to sleep now.

279
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,182
One can't sleep in a moment like that.

280
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:56,701
I'll doze off, remembering everything...

281
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,476
Don't worry,

282
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,670
You'll get your breakfast on time.

283
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,835
That's not what I meant, Mehwish.

284
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,864
I can cook breakfast myself, too.

285
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:08,485
You should get some sleep.

286
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:09,725
I will.

287
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:12,118
You'd better sleep, now, too.

288
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:23,323
Why are you laughing?

289
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,722
Nothing really, just...

290
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,061
How innocently you act

291
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,186
To fool someone!

292
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:34,894
Who have I fooled?

293
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,205
Your friend.

294
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,733
You quickly said, 'Yes',

295
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:39,935
'We'll be there the night after tomorrow'.

296
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:42,140
I wasn't lying.

297
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,803
So you're <i>actually</i> going?

298
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,952
What did you think?

299
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,189
I thought you'd just said it to get rid of him.

300
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,887
After all, he was insisting so much, too.

301
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:54,312
He was insisting, but

302
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:56,094
I'd actually said

303
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:59,186
That we'd be there.

304
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,821
What would I wear?

305
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,580
Leave it be.

306
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,524
It's not as if you've signed a deal.

307
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:11,276
Call him in the morning and excuse yourself.

308
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:12,538
Why don't you

309
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,686
Wear your black sari?

310
00:21:14,686 --> 00:21:15,726
The one

311
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:18,430
That exposes my bare waist?

312
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,323
What are you saying!

313
00:21:20,323 --> 00:21:22,921
You have tomorrow, don't you?

314
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,710
Get a new blouse stitched.

315
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,415
So you've got everything planned!

316
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:32,176
He was insisting so much...

317
00:21:32,176 --> 00:21:33,807
It didn't seem proper

318
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,707
To decline,

319
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:38,251
But if you say,

320
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:40,344
I can call him tomorrow

321
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:43,369
And excuse myself.

322
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:47,317
As you like it.

323
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:50,562
It's 2.30, go to sleep now.

324
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,680
Who is it?

325
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:00,177
Who was it?

326
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:02,183
No idea.

327
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:04,913
Rang the bell and made a run for it.

328
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:08,207
It's 7.30 already, however will I have breakfast in 15 minutes!

329
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:10,632
I'm coming.

330
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,622
Know what,

331
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:17,582
This was my favourite hobby.

332
00:23:17,582 --> 00:23:19,413
What hobby?

333
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:22,187
I'd ring a bell and disappear.

334
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:24,188
Right up to my college days!

335
00:23:24,188 --> 00:23:26,299
Sometimes, I'd even get caught.

336
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:28,319
If this bugger gets caught,

337
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,265
I'd punch him right in the face.

338
00:23:30,265 --> 00:23:33,266
Calm down, Danish.

339
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:37,156
Hey! It's not even been 5 minutes!

340
00:23:37,156 --> 00:23:39,114
Sit and have your breakfast.

341
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:42,145
I've finished. Give me my lunch.

342
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,033
Where's the lunch box?

343
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:48,333
Get something for lunch -- yourself.

344
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,550
Alright.

345
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,944
Say goodbye to Rumi from me when he's up.

346
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:55,808
Hey --

347
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:57,541
Listen.

348
00:23:57,892 --> 00:24:00,544
You didn't tell me about going.

349
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:02,197
I'm going.

350
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:04,417
Is the swelling better now?

351
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,667
I'm asking about going <i>there</i>.

352
00:24:06,667 --> 00:24:10,295
I won't go if you suddenly told me once you're back.

353
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,876
Getting the blouse stitched will take time.

354
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:15,497
Oh, you mean going <i>there</i>.

355
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,472
We'll be going.

356
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,689
Get your blouse stitched,

357
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,666
And let me know when you're leaving.

358
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,056
Okay.

359
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:22,322
And be careful -

360
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:26,209
Not an inch of your waist peeping!
-Not an inch!

361
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:28,134
Alright.

362
00:25:33,344 --> 00:25:34,703
I'll have tea in a while.

363
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:38,367
Your tea is in the Boss's room. He's calling you.

364
00:25:49,663 --> 00:25:50,585
May I come in, sir?

365
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,602
Please, come in.

366
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,226
Sit.

367
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:03,380
Meet Mr Munir Hussain.

368
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,010
Number 5 among the top 10 contractors

369
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,600
In Karachi.

370
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,007
Hi.

371
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:09,866
Hi, sir...

372
00:26:09,866 --> 00:26:10,835
How are you?

373
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,898
I've heard

374
00:26:11,898 --> 00:26:14,413
Quaid'e Azam [Jinnah] shows up in your dreams.

375
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:16,022
So he did in mine, too.

376
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,039
But as long as he showed up,

377
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,277
Banknotes with his picture didn't.

378
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:21,443
No...

379
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:23,043
Not Quaid'e Azam [Jinnah].

380
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:26,381
I mentioned my Dad.

381
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:29,562
You don't believe me, do you, sir?

382
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:31,610
A very rich friend of mine

383
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,203
Laughs just like that

384
00:26:34,203 --> 00:26:37,761
When he can't believe me.

385
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:44,625
Finish this quickly, now.
-Give it to me.

386
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:48,236
Maman will feed you, or you know you make a proper mess here.

387
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,847
Good boy.

388
00:26:49,847 --> 00:26:52,208
Maman's also --

389
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,604
Alright, here. Have this, alright?

390
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:57,854
Don't drop it somewhere. I'll be back.

391
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,038
Hello?

392
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,758
Good morning.

393
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,718
Who is it?

394
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:10,750
So, all those who said

395
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,351
That anyone who's heard my voice will remember it

396
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:15,783
Have been lying to me.

397
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,937
It's Shehwar.

398
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:20,500
You?

399
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,222
Who gave you my number?

400
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,831
Do you feel bad about it?

401
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,580
I'd asked Anoushay for Mr Danish's number,

402
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,220
And she gave me yours by mistake.

403
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,977
I'm sorry if you feel bad about it.

404
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:36,982
No --

405
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,099
The thing is,

406
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:39,711
It's just a bit strange...

407
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:42,290
Danish had given you his number.

408
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,976
I forgot to save it.

409
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:46,915
Oh...

410
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:49,237
How are you?

411
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:50,154
I'm --

412
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:52,716
Fine.

413
00:27:53,094 --> 00:27:55,679
And how's Danish?

414
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,005
He's fine too.

415
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:59,109
He's at the office.

416
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:00,406
Oh.

417
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:02,776
I thought he'd be at home.

418
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:03,907
Well,

419
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,531
Then, that's my excuse to talk to you.

420
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:08,126
Yes...

421
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,057
May I ask you something?

422
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,947
Sure.

423
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:16,669
Promise me you won't mind it.

424
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:18,669
I promise.

425
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:22,771
Have you ever listened to your voice?

426
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:26,013
I do every day.

427
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:30,356
No, not how you're thinking.

428
00:28:30,356 --> 00:28:32,094
Then?

429
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:36,538
We just know we're speaking when we speak.

430
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:39,474
We don't listen to our voice.

431
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:41,911
The others do.

432
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,921
You listen when I speak,

433
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:46,920
And I listen when you speak.

434
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,249
That's it.

435
00:28:51,183 --> 00:28:52,289
Please,

436
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,929
Never listen to your voice.

437
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,229
Why?

438
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:02,088
You'll grow to love it.

439
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,382
You're coming tomorrow, aren't you?

440
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,666
Yes, he --

441
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,492
Said we would.

442
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:14,544
I, too, had said it rather confidently

443
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,820
My heart felt

444
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,086
You'd come if I invited you.

445
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:20,669
Yes, we'd be coming.

446
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:23,383
What do you like to eat?

447
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:26,056
An -- anything -- I'd eat anything.

448
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,782
How can that be?

449
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,217
One who's so selective about what she wears

450
00:29:31,217 --> 00:29:36,217
Could not possibly be so casual about what she eats.

451
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:41,315
Looking at you, one can never guess that your husband earns so little,

452
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:44,389
Or is it just that you really know how to dress?

453
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:45,825
Know what,

454
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:50,669
I've changed a lot after meeting you.

455
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:52,342
Yes?

456
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:53,982
Looking in the mirror,

457
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:58,685
I take a good look at myself.

458
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:01,456
Won't you ask why?

459
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,561
Please, go on.

460
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:08,733
I'd heard that matches are made in Heaven,

461
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:10,260
But, meeting you,

462
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,265
I'm forced to think

463
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:15,658
That people just say it to humour themselves,

464
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:21,497
For the Lord can never be so unjust.

465
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:23,264
I didn't get it.

466
00:30:23,264 --> 00:30:27,008
If you sew a diamond button to a 400 buck shirt,

467
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:29,553
The button does not protest,

468
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:31,446
But the one who looks at it

469
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:35,159
Does protest, doesn't he?

470
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,334
Leave the dinner up to me.

471
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:42,389
I have good tastes.

472
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:45,092
Alright.

473
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:47,681
9 p.m. tomorrow?

474
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,665
Yes, I remember.

475
00:30:50,665 --> 00:30:52,322
And here

476
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,379
I can't forget my helplessness.

477
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:57,409
What helplessness?

478
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,940
I have all the riches in the world, so to speak;

479
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,301
People think I can do anything.

480
00:31:03,301 --> 00:31:04,879
But, even if I wish,

481
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,315
I can't

482
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:10,331
Change today into tomorrow.

483
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:15,215
See you tomorrow at 9.

484
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:19,657
I'm waiting for it to be tomorrow...

485
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:21,726
Bye...

486
00:31:21,726 --> 00:31:24,003
Bye.

487
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:37,450
Rumi!

488
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,476
You've dropped it again!

489
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:42,513
I told you I'd feed you.

490
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:01,642
Lean forward and look at the front seat.

491
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:02,620
Me?

492
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,401
Yes.

493
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:13,130
Th -- There's some Rupees here.

494
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,500
Half and half -- that's one...

495
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,189
Speak freely, will you?

496
00:32:17,189 --> 00:32:19,670
One million.

497
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,780
Right.
-It's for you.

498
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,144
For me?

499
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,212
Yes.

500
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:27,600
I heard

501
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,867
Your lady wants that you should have a car?

502
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,410
Not at all --

503
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,395
I mean, yes --

504
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:37,848
Everyone talks about such things, you know...

505
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:40,410
I, too, want that I should have everything,

506
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,868
But no one gets everything.

507
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:45,855
Someone gets a car; another gets his love.

508
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:49,649
Why don't you wear a <i>sherwani</i> and Jinnah cap?

509
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:50,552
Sir?

510
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,013
Let me tell you something about the times.

511
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,070
If you can't keep up with the times,

512
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,040
You'd be left behind,

513
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,382
And nobody will even turn back to look at you.

514
00:33:01,382 --> 00:33:03,131
I say,

515
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,868
Here's 1 million,

516
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:07,507
Keep it with you for two days,

517
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:09,804
And give it back to me after that.

518
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:11,007
In fact,

519
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,334
Call

520
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:14,355
Your lady right now.

521
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:16,620
No, I won't tell her.

522
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,881
Why?

523
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:22,086
If you're so honest, why don't you share everything with your wife?

524
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:24,659
Why are you insisting, Mr Munir?

525
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:26,497
I -- won't take a bribe.

526
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:28,851
Who said I'm bribing you?

527
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:30,258
Then? This --

528
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,711
What's this million?

529
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:33,344
A hiring amount.

530
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,324
I'm hiring you for another job.

531
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:37,720
Another job?

532
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,743
How can I start another job?

533
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,868
It's impossible.

534
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:45,788
When'd I come to you if I'm here from 8 to 4?

535
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:47,678
Who said anything about coming anywhere?

536
00:33:47,678 --> 00:33:49,148
Just keep on working,

537
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:52,297
And collect your salary.

538
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,103
And --

539
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:54,624
What's the job?

540
00:33:54,624 --> 00:33:56,383
Don't ask about the work.

541
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:59,987
Ask how much you'd be earning.

542
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,362
How much?

543
00:34:01,362 --> 00:34:03,594
Half a million a month.

544
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:06,094
And this 1 million is an advance

545
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:10,238
From the company to buy a car.

546
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:25,052
When could I get it?

547
00:35:25,052 --> 00:35:28,751
It's 2 right now, Ma'am. You could send someone by around 7.

548
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,563
Alright.

549
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,815
Just a minute.

550
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:35,846
Yes, Danish?

551
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:37,693
Why aren't you opening the door?

552
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:39,366
Are you at the door?

553
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,844
I've been here for 10 minutes, and I've rung the bell three times.

554
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,090
Were you sleeping?

555
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,781
No, I'm at the tailor's.

556
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:47,431
At the tailor's?

557
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:49,625
Open the door with your key, will you?

558
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,219
I don't have the key.

559
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:54,328
I forgot to keep it with me in my hurry.

560
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:57,000
Splendid, Danish...

561
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,188
Splendid, mate...

562
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:01,173
Leaving without even telling me...

563
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,816
Why are you arguing like that?
-I'm not arguing.

564
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:04,816
Come quickly.

565
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:06,709
I have a --

566
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:09,634
I have a million Rupees with me.

567
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,286
A mi --

568
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,020
Alright, I'll be there quickly.

569
00:36:17,898 --> 00:36:18,571
Come.

570
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,882
Remember, sir, it shouldn't show an inch of my waist.
-Don't worry, Ma'am.

571
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:23,204
Come.

572
00:36:23,204 --> 00:36:25,158
Quickly, now.

573
00:36:30,212 --> 00:36:32,509
Mr Munir's given it to me.

574
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,176
Who's Mr Munir?

575
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,957
He's a known contractor.

576
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:38,193
He said he's hiring me

577
00:36:38,193 --> 00:36:40,207
For a new job.

578
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,831
This is the signing amount.

579
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,368
A million...

580
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,197
We're riding our car tomorrow.
-He was lying, Mehwish.

581
00:36:48,197 --> 00:36:50,253
This is a bribe.

582
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:54,360
To 'earn' this, I have to write 'Okay' and sign every right and wrong he does.

583
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,615
Just do it! What's it to your father?

584
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:59,051
It's everything to my father, Mehwish.

585
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:02,378
Dad would think I've smeared his grave.

586
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:07,207
Dad's <i>dead</i>, Danish; he won't feel a thing if you smear or bomb his grave.
-Watch what you're saying!

587
00:37:07,207 --> 00:37:09,488
Alright, why have you brought the money, then?

588
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:12,490
Do you want to show it off or tempt me?

589
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,786
I'd brought this to check my integrity.

590
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:18,433
Mr Munir thinks

591
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,520
My intentions would change

592
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,348
If I kept this money with me for two days.

593
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:25,974
But I'm afraid, Mehwish...

594
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:28,007
If I kept so much money at home,

595
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:29,990
How would I sleep?
-Alright, then.

596
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,255
Stay awake.

597
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:33,383
Listen, will you? Why --

598
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:34,832
Why are you so angry?

599
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:37,472
You're not returning this money, Danish.

600
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:41,269
Thank the Lord if He's been kind to us.

601
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:43,972
Keep this in the cupboard and go to sleep.

602
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,473
And take a bribe?
-It's not a bribe, Danish!

603
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,990
It's a reward for your hard work and integrity.

604
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,564
How hard you work,

605
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:54,087
Running around on that old bike of yours,

606
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:57,480
Only to hear a load of guff from one like Monty!

607
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,330
Do you remember that your bike didn't even start the other day?

608
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:06,887
Rumi's four now and he hasn't started school yet.

609
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:08,813
If we save something for his admission,

610
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:12,328
It gets spent somewhere quickly.

611
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:13,809
You've just got 3 or 4 pairs of trousers,

612
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:16,233
And some 4 or 6 shirts.

613
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:21,712
I'm thinking of what you'd wear to dinner tomorrow.

614
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,752
Show it to me for once.

615
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:28,191
What?

616
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:30,440
The one million.

617
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,980
Here.

618
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:57,157
I can't believe it, Danish...

619
00:38:57,157 --> 00:38:59,906
I can't believe it either, Mehwish.

620
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:01,779
My head's spinning around...

621
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:03,949
Why don't you take a nap?

622
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,279
Relax, Danish.

623
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,416
No, I'm --

624
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:08,262
I'm not sleepy.

625
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,575
You're still struggling over Dad, aren't you?
-No.

626
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:14,966
I'm trying to forget Dad.

627
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,153
Dad's dead.

628
00:39:17,153 --> 00:39:18,453
So,

629
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:20,559
It's over now, innit?

630
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:23,530
May he be happy wherever he is.

631
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,530
One can't run a household on this piffling salary.

632
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,703
I'll wash my face and hands.

633
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:37,454
Dad hasn't the foggiest that petrol now costs 110 Rupees a litre;

634
00:39:37,454 --> 00:39:39,844
Rumi's fees add up to 10,000;

635
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:40,835
And

636
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:43,796
A picnic on Sunday drains out every penny one's saved.

637
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,595
When buying a burger, I ask,

638
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,595
'Which one's the cheapest'?

639
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:58,608
If he showed up in my dream, I'd say to him,

640
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:06,011
'If one can't even fulfil such piffling dreams, it feels as if one's been kicked in the teeth',

641
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:09,775
'Which is why I'm sorry, Dad'...

642
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
