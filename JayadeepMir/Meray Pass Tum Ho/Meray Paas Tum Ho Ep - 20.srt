1
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,810
Sit.

2
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,528
I've come to meet you.

3
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,400
Just think

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,210
As if I've come to see

5
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,380
What someone who's been disloyal looks like

6
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,406
When betrayed herself.

7
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,620
I won't pick a fight

8
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,284
Or slap you.

9
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,826
Sit down.

10
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,639
Let's have a little chat like old friends, shall we?

11
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,990
Forgive me for the slap the other day.

12
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,090
It occurred to me later

13
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,270
That it was unnecessary to slap a woman

14
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,926
Who'd clawed her own face apart.

15
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,646
So, I'm sorry.

16
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,300
No.

17
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,000
You've come to meet me.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,320
Otherwise, I thought I'd meet you someday,

19
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,130
Kiss your hand, saying,

20
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,266
'Thank you for slapping me'.

21
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,350
One who's been sleeping for five months is as good as dead,

22
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,616
Or, rather, one's conscience is dead.

23
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:37,458
Nothing less than a slap can wake one up then.

24
00:02:39,257 --> 00:02:40,666
Would you like something?

25
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:44,037
You can get tea, coffee, or whatever you like.

26
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:45,948
No.

27
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:49,628
Nothing, thank you.

28
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,568
Why have you come, then?

29
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,810
It sounds odd to ask this,

30
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,396
But we were not supposed to meet.

31
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,096
I figured we ought to meet one last time.

32
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:10,660
I'd apologise to you,

33
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,244
You'd forgive me,

34
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:17,816
And I'd ask you what I could do for you.

35
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,320
Please ask the Lord

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,630
To forgive me.

37
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,561
I will.

38
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,576
Perhaps I already have.

39
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:34,096
That's why I've come.

40
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,246
Diwan told me after you were gone

41
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:41,636
That you've been with my husband for five months.

42
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:47,606
I saw that he was getting married to you that day.

43
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:51,696
He'd brought you on equal footing with me.

44
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,437
Have you been living with him for free?

45
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,016
You're so stupid...

46
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,986
I'm his wife.

47
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:05,836
Even <i>I</i> haven't been with him for free.

48
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,326
He gives me 5 million every month.

49
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:13,206
Even if I stay in America for five months.

50
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:18,919
So, I thought

51
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,577
That you've officiated as a wife

52
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:26,190
For five months,

53
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,870
Enjoying my status,

54
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,830
As my equal,

55
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,846
But you haven't gotten an equal pay.

56
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,116
Mr Diwan!

57
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,829
Give me the cheque.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,306
This is a cheque for 25 million.

59
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,220
5 months' worth of equal pay.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,426
No.

61
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,492
I don't want the money.

62
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,716
You can't get Shehwar Ahmed.

63
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,220
When a husband's wronged his wife,

64
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,750
She gets to have a ball with him for the rest of her life.

65
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,210
I won't give you that.

66
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,190
I don't want him, either.

67
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,550
Then, keep the money.

68
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,287
When one's fallen in love with such a man,

69
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:32,078
It's more a wish than love.

70
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,650
Fulfil your wish,

71
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,930
Otherwise, the punishment that is destined for you

72
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,900
Might as well kill you before it's over

73
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,917
If you haven't got any money.

74
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:52,460
Please,

75
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,030
Don't die so quickly.

76
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,066
Looking at you,

77
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,057
Many women

78
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:01,837
Would learn a lot.

79
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:07,080
Perhaps, then, it may even be

80
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,600
That you'll not have to beg someone else to ask forgiveness of God.

81
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,001
We'll never meet again.

82
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,900
Aren't you happy?

83
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,110
The portfolio's risen by 25%

84
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,330
In about 15 days

85
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,316
And look at your blooming expression, boyo!

86
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,300
I'm filthy rich, right?

87
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,080
Any doubts?

88
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,900
This

89
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,662
This doubt will remain, Salman.

90
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,356
She left me so poor

91
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,880
That that poverty

92
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,060
Never lets me get rich.

93
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,690
Please meet her once.

94
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,746
Rumi wants the same.

95
00:07:56,746 --> 00:08:00,306
That's what we talked about over breakfast.

96
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,600
He's just a kid.

97
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,192
I couldn't tell him properly that I couldn't live without Mehwish,

98
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:11,112
And I haven't, really.

99
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,614
I'd died the moment she'd left me.

100
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,870
Dead in a way

101
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,490
That no doctor can tell by my pulse or eyes

102
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,049
That I'm gone.

103
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,111
But the truth is, I've been long gone by now.

104
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:36,612
I swear, I'd died.

105
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,510
But now,

106
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,380
I do get a bit of this feeling

107
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,036
That I'm alive again.

108
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,791
If indeed I am, just let me live, mate.

109
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,611
I'd died back when she'd left me,

110
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:58,401
And I'd die again if she came to meet me.

111
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,860
So, stop it, please.

112
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:11,102
This love is not your bleedin' stock market.

113
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,741
In love, when a value falls,

114
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,811
It falls forever.

115
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:25,653
What a splendid timing!

116
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,923
Timing?

117
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,673
You'd hide it from me?

118
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,606
Hide what?

119
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,350
Call her upstairs. As if you've got anything to hide from me.

120
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,416
Hide? And call who?

121
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:41,937
She's down in the parking lot, by your car.

122
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,180
Ask her to leave.

123
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,520
I wanted to stand here by your car for a while

124
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,410
And feel how you'd look in this grand car,

125
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,980
And marvel at how you've raced ahead,

126
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,570
Leaving me behind,

127
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,200
But Ayesha spotted me.

128
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,980
I would've left without writing this apology if she hadn't seen me.

129
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,470
I wouldn't have had to say,

130
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,126
'Sorry for showing up without permission'.

131
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,020
Hey there.

132
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,272
I talked to your Papa.

133
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,646
You rapscallion.

134
00:12:00,646 --> 00:12:03,360
So you'd get <i>me</i> married to him?

135
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
You shameless lad.

136
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,470
Sorry.

137
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,926
Apologised right away. Fair enough.

138
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:14,080
Actually, he can't get married.

139
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,076
He would after he's forgiven Maman.

140
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,271
And why would he marry someone else if he forgave Maman?

141
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,300
You won't get it.

142
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,400
He says Maman would be forgiven

143
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,506
When he would forget her.

144
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:35,756
He can't bring himself to call Maman back.

145
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,439
You should marry someone else.

146
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,160
And there he was, sitting quietly in a corner. I thought I'd ask.

147
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,096
Why?

148
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,010
He's my student.

149
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,746
Do you have just one student?

150
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,670
Why do you only talk about him?

151
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,030
Because he's one of my favourites.

152
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,640
Put a sock in it.

153
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,489
As in?

154
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,590
His Dad's a favourite of yours, too.

155
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,170
There's something in you

156
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,898
That pulls you right towards him.

157
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,031
Are you touched in the head?

158
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:19,475
You've started using your brain in your heart's matters.

159
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:20,834
You're making a mistake...

160
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,974
Not good for you!

161
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,310
You!

162
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,406
Good evening.

163
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,036
Good evening.

164
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,254
Please, come in.

165
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,460
Do you know why I've come?

166
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,350
Pray tell.

167
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:08,720
Y --

168
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,716
You'd feel bad to hear it.

169
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:15,086
How would you know that?

170
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,046
Because I feel so.

171
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,560
I'd thought I'd say it right away

172
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,856
But I couldn't.

173
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:30,966
Try it now.

174
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:34,560
I'd say 'I don't mind it' even if I did.

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,680
You'd asked for tea.

176
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,116
Please -- when -- ask when it'd be ready.

177
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,572
Right here, sir.

178
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,672
Here's your tea.

179
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,946
I figure you've been listening in?

180
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,586
Please, sit, will you?

181
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,896
I'd talk before you.

182
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,816
Right...

183
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:23,456
I'd come to ask Hania to marry me.

184
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,366
J -- Just a minute. Don't get worried...

185
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:33,420
I'd just come to say it.

186
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,707
But I didn't.

187
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,981
I changed my mind right at your doorstep.

188
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,436
I felt that

189
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,226
I was just getting even with Mehwish.

190
00:15:49,226 --> 00:15:52,076
I do want to, yes,

191
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,322
And I know

192
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:57,036
That it'd hurt her a lot

193
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,730
To hear about my marriage.

194
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,410
Not least because

195
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:06,080
She couldn't get married to her boyfriend.

196
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Plus, I've gotten rich too.

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,276
You're listening, aren't you?

198
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,057
Yes.

199
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:23,986
So that's why I changed my mind.

200
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:26,310
I felt like I was just using you.

201
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,800
What?

202
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,170
I mean

203
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,070
I thought

204
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,130
That if you agreed,

205
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,132
You'd end up as just a means to get even.

206
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,990
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm not good with words.

208
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,140
Back in my schooldays, I'd write,

209
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,251
'Bitter melon makes bitter foes'.

210
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,900
Hello?

211
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,586
Yes, it's me.

212
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,549
What?

213
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,307
Oh my God...

214
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:26,166
Salman!

215
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,930
Won't you wait for Papa today?

216
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,547
No.

217
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,370
Please give me my phone, Uncle Latif.

218
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,916
Sure.

219
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,730
Hello?

220
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,756
Just five days after Mehwish and I had started talking,

221
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,280
I said to her, 'Will you marry me'?

222
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
If I said the same to someone else,

223
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,670
I'd feel like it's nothing special,

224
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,986
That it's not heartfelt, that it's just a formality.

225
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,790
Samosas...

226
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,150
I've had enough already...

227
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,488
Here.

228
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,410
So, maybe,

229
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,890
If I came again,

230
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,870
Saying the same thing to you,

231
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,700
Please don't take it seriously.

232
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,908
The thing is, Rumi likes you a lot.

233
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:36,660
Thank goodness

234
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,660
He's not grown up, otherwise, <i>he</i> would've proposed to you!

235
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,220
If he insists, I may come here again.

236
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,046
And yes, I'd bring him along.

237
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:50,766
If I said, 'Will you marry me' to you before him,

238
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,240
Please say, 'No, no way'!

239
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,006
Just refuse.

240
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,236
So...

241
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,190
So, may I go?

242
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,660
W --
-I mean, I'll take my leave.

243
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,777
Alright.
-Alright.

244
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,868
And thank you.

245
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,886
Oh --

246
00:19:09,886 --> 00:19:11,300
Please, allow me.

247
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,049
Over here.

248
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,360
Thank you.

249
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,800
Okay.

250
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,566
Good night.

251
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,036
Good night.

252
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,716
Wait.

253
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,836
Please don't come here to say all of that even if Rumi insists,

254
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:45,806
And, even if you do come, please don't say, 'Will you marry me'?

255
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,328
I might as well say 'Yes'.

256
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,386
Bye.

257
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:57,830
Bye.

258
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,606
What has she done?

259
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,977
She's slit her wrist.

260
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:43,670
Please don't come here to say all of that even if Rumi insists,

261
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,620
And, even if you do come, please don't say, 'Will you marry me'?

262
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,360
I might as well say 'Yes'.

263
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,990
My words had scared you.

264
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,970
I'm a tad possessive, innit?

265
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,300
So, I say things I shouldn't really say.

266
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,180
Obviously, you'd be afraid...

267
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,480
One lies when afraid.

268
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,256
A wife does, 100%.

269
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,579
I'll apologise to you when we get back.

270
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:19,260
And please, have no fear.

271
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,911
Just let me know if you're going to Islamabad.

272
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,496
Is everything alright there, sir?

273
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,142
Where?

274
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:21,480
At the hospital.

275
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,320
Hospital?

276
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,596
Who's in the hospital?

277
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:24,976
Don't you know?

278
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,596
Rumi's Maman.

279
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,190
It's very serious.

280
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,726
What?

281
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:31,907
Where's Rumi?

282
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:33,610
He left the moment he heard.

283
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,760
The driver insisted, 'Inform Papa',

284
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,100
But he didn't agree.

285
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,140
He said,

286
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,347
'Papa would rather not go there'.

287
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,048
Open the door.

288
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,590
Is she alive?

289
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,420
Yes, she's alive.

290
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,230
Sleeping?

291
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,510
Yes, sleeping.

292
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,726
Will she get up?

293
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:10,826
Hopefully.

294
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,516
Papa!

295
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,000
You haven't said a word since he left.

296
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,250
You didn't tell me anything.

297
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:01,158
There was nothing left to be said.

298
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,200
He was lying.

299
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,700
In that case, he was sinning.

300
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,046
Oh? Well, that's no proper reply.

301
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:23,290
I'm not giving the reply you want.

302
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,706
I'll just say that if he was lying,

303
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:30,176
He's committing a greater sin than infidelity.

304
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,596
There are two kinds of sinners in love -

305
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:35,476
The disloyal,

306
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:38,756
And those who weep for them.

307
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,226
She's come to.

308
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,870
Will you do me a favour?

309
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,870
Sure.

310
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,296
Take care of the cops.

311
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,820
And pay the bill if there's any problem.

312
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,736
Alright.

313
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:25,266
Thank you.

314
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,892
Maman!

315
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,566
Rumi!

316
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,244
Hello?

317
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:45,270
Hello.

318
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,171
Danish here.

319
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:49,010
Are you at the door?

320
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,599
No. I'm in the car.

321
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,820
Going home.

322
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,290
Oh.

323
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,300
I wanted to tell you that Rumi won't be going to school today.

324
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,970
Please send in a leave application from him.

325
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,440
For how long?

326
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,850
Not sure.

327
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,220
Just one day for now.

328
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,900
I'll let you know if any more would be needed.

329
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,770
Needed, as in,

330
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,630
What's the matter?

331
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,640
What it is is

332
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,800
His mother's in the hospital.

333
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,259
He'd be with her.

334
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:19,646
It may be more than a day.

335
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,160
Alright, I'll --

336
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,300
Did you come here with Papa?

337
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,932
No. With the driver.

338
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,396
Didn't Papa come?

339
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,540
Where is he?

340
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,500
He went back.

341
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,410
Did he see me?

342
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,286
No.

343
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,550
I want to meet you.

344
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,080
I've spent five months telling myself

345
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,700
And getting myself to believe

346
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,436
That I can't meet you now.

347
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:46,160
Can't even call out to you now.

348
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,340
Can't say, 'Mehwish',

349
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,616
'This button's fallen off my shirt'.

350
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,150
Alright, tell me,

351
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,450
If she came back, apologised,

352
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,160
Fell at your feet,

353
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,850
Talked about old love,

354
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,996
What would you do?

355
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,580
You silly bugger,

356
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,590
If you have to call it 'old love' like this,

357
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,517
Know that it wasn't 'love' in the 'good old days' either.

358
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,730
She's happy that he'd come,

359
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,829
Even if he'd left without meeting her.

360
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:53,919
What's the matter?

361
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,307
Nothing.

362
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,356
Please, tell me.

363
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:03,591
I'm afraid, Ayesha.

364
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,638
Such repentance scares me.

365
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:09,430
It feels like

366
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:12,470
Leaving Danish was her mistake,

367
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,916
And wanting to come back is her sin.

368
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:21,680
Mistakes can be corrected, Ayesha.

369
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,029
Not sins.

370
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,756
You've taken a leave today.

371
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,960
You'd stay with me?

372
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,530
Yes.

373
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,090
Won't Papa mind?

374
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,856
No.

375
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:33,140
We'd gone to Murree once.

376
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,832
It was so cold...

377
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:39,567
My ankle got sprained while climbing the stairs at the hotel.

378
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,117
My foot hurt so bad.

379
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,246
Just a spot of blood, but your Papa was so distressed over it.

380
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:51,070
It was 2 a.m.

381
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,350
He booked a cab,

382
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,740
Got me in, and rushed me to the hospital.

383
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,026
Papa was not at peace

384
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,826
Until I'd been bandaged

385
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:02,916
And had fallen asleep.

386
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
That's what your Papa was like.

387
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,576
Remember, also, how he used to cook food whenever you had a headache.

388
00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:20,320
He didn't know how to cook.

389
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,331
He'd only make an omelette.

390
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:27,032
You didn't have a headache either. You'd just say it.

391
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,351
The doctor says they'd discharge you by the evening.

392
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,730
Promise me, Mehwish,

393
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,920
You'll never do something like this again.

394
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,926
I promise.

395
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,730
Yes, Rumi?

396
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,690
The doctor says she's fine now. She can go back by the evening.

397
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,290
Good.

398
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,100
Are you happy?

399
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,476
Yeah.

400
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:13,920
Is Aunt Ayesha there?

401
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,890
Uncle and Aunt are here.

402
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,326
We'd all go and drop her.

403
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:19,856
Alright, see you at dinner.

404
00:33:19,856 --> 00:33:25,410
Not dinner, Papa. Breakfast. Maman's asked me to stay with her tonight.

405
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,256
You're being unfaithful.

406
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,410
Please, let me be, Papa.

407
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,540
Just joking, Papa.

408
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,110
I love you.

409
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,540
I love you more.

410
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,290
See you.

411
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,066
See you.

412
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,196
Please wait here. I'll leave her inside.

413
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,951
Thank you so much.

414
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,316
I'll take my leave.

415
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:56,310
Alright. Thank you.

416
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,180
Call me if there's any problem.

417
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,646
Rumi's with me.

418
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,786
He'll handle everything.

419
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:04,460
Bye, Rumi.

420
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,386
Take care.

421
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,626
Hello, teacher.

422
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,930
How's your Mum?

423
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,106
Fine.

424
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:30,016
We're back from the hospital.

425
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:31,640
What'd happened to her?

426
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,736
Her wrist had gotten cut.

427
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:38,120
I didn't come to school either. Didn't tell about my leave either.

428
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,010
Would I have to pay a fine?

429
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,080
No, you won't.

430
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,720
Your Papa had informed me.

431
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,660
Are you at home?

432
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,270
No.

433
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,996
I'm at Maman's hostel.

434
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:52,080
Is Papa with you?

435
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,667
No.

436
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,641
Get me through to your Maman.

437
00:35:57,191 --> 00:36:00,003
My teacher wants to talk to you.

438
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,000
Hello?

439
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,986
Hania here.

440
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,206
I know.

441
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:18,427
I thought I'd ask you when I got to know about your health.

442
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,730
Who told you about my health?

443
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,776
Danish.

444
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,450
He told me that you're in the hospital when he called to inform me about Rumi's leave.

445
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,770
I'm fine now.

446
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,510
I thought I'd come to the hospital to meet you,

447
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,710
But...

448
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,390
But?

449
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,360
I figured I ought not to.

450
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,126
He might've stayed a while longer if you'd come.

451
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:48,876
He came and left without meeting me.

452
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:51,597
You'd feel bad about it, right?

453
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:55,320
No -- Why -- Why would I?

454
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,180
I know him.

455
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,706
He's cautious about his relationship.

456
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:01,787
He'd think,

457
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,650
'This will definitely hurt my girlfriend'.

458
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,570
Sorry.

459
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,710
I just uttered 'girlfriend' by mistake.

460
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,990
I can't say 'wife' just now.

461
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,130
Bye.

462
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,506
Bye.
-Uh --

463
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:14,907
What happened?

464
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:17,764
You're absolutely fine now.

465
00:37:17,764 --> 00:37:19,668
That's all I wanted to know.

466
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:21,257
Bye.

467
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,560
She's suspecting me!

468
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,790
Who?

469
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,400
Danish's ex.

470
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,910
Mehwish?

471
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,013
Did she call you?

472
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:40,677
I called.

473
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,236
Why?

474
00:37:42,737 --> 00:37:47,519
She'd been in the hospital after slitting her wrist. I thought I'd ask her how she is.

475
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,707
Why?

476
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:51,487
Who's she to you?

477
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:53,877
She's Rumi's mother.

478
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:56,600
And who's Rumi to you?

479
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:58,617
C'mon, Watira!

480
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:00,197
He's my student, mate.

481
00:38:00,197 --> 00:38:02,839
Don't your other students have Mums?

482
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,386
You don't ask how they are.

483
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,907
Why always Rumi?

484
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,366
What are you looking at?

485
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:12,987
What's this guff?

486
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,040
It's not guff.

487
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,961
I'm telling you that you ought to be suspected.

488
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:20,506
And I totally believe

489
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,740
That if he actually showed up and said,

490
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,326
'Marry me',

491
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:27,326
You'd say right away, 'Sure'!

492
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,306
He'd never say that.

493
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,590
He hasn't got the guts.

494
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:39,376
This time, he wants to love someone who, besides love, would guarantee her lifelong loyalty to him.

495
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,582
There's no woman

496
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:44,092
Nor guarantee like that.

497
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:47,180
This time around, too, he'd just have to trust.

498
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,116
Understood?

499
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,006
Hi, Danish.

500
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:59,147
Hi.

501
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:00,360
How are you?

502
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,176
How are you?

503
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,730
I've been awake all night.

504
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:05,416
Just freshened up and came here.

505
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,370
And why have you come here?

506
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,296
Because of her.

507
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,126
What is it?

508
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,990
Why is she looking at me like my Mum?

509
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,576
Sit.

510
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,010
Sit down.

511
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,056
Just listen to me quietly.

512
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,790
I've spent a few hours with her,

513
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,096
I've learned <i>something</i>, to say the least.

514
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:42,133
Slitting one's wrist and killing oneself doesn't hurt so much

515
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:46,954
As living on in repentance does, Danish.

516
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:52,710
She's suffered these wounds by her own hand, so she can't even tell the name of the one who's hurt her.

517
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,508
She must be dying a million times over every night.

518
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:57,936
And do you know

519
00:39:57,936 --> 00:40:00,550
Why she's dead, but still dragging on?

520
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,466
She feels that you'd say her name and call out to her one day,

521
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,566
And bring her back to life.

522
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,270
I know that it hurts men,

523
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,930
But just for once,

524
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:21,116
Just once, try to muster the courage to forgive your wife's disloyalty.

525
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:22,270
There must be a man out there

526
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,150
There must be a man out there who would forgive the woman.

527
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,120
That's what I think, too.

528
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,717
I want to forgive her, too.

529
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:36,490
But then, I think of the Lord.

530
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,080
What do you mean?

531
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,716
Even the Lord does not forgive unfaithfulness to Him.

532
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
