1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,573
I've never thought that I haven't got a luxury car,

2
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:21,213
Or a mansion,

3
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:23,928
Or more than what I earn right now.

4
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:25,855
Do you know why?

5
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:27,298
Because I've got you.

6
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:28,703
Because I've got you.
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

7
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,044
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

8
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:32,622
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

9
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:34,305
Mind if I call you if I miss you?
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

10
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:35,348
You don't need to ask.
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

11
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,333
Of course not.
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,670
And if I miss you a lot?
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,984
Call me again, then.

14
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:41,044
Get going already.

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,180
Even when I go to the office,

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,580
I have you sit right by my side.

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,190
And when nobody's listening,

18
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,154
I talk to you, too!

19
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,365
All the grand dreams...

20
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,905
And then you imprisoned me in this tiny flat after our marriage.

21
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:55,962
Should I sell the motorcycle?

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,761
How would you go to office, then?

23
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,152
There's a bus that goes that way.

24
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:01,981
Your motorcycle costs no more than 30,000.

25
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:04,992
Do you remember how much the necklace costs?

26
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,090
Rumi's four now and he hasn't started school yet.

27
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,890
If we save something for his admission,

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,847
It gets spent somewhere quickly.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,957
You're pitying my helplessness, aren't you?

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,800
People spend money like they're mad these days.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,317
Even the servants' gowns cost no less than 7,000.

32
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:23,145
Just think you've got me.

33
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,170
Surely, I have.

34
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,211
Then, just say that you don't want anything else.

35
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,852
As in, say to God that I don't want anything else?

36
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,400
If He heard it,

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,480
He'd <i>actually</i> give nothing!

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,032
I want a lot from Him besides you.

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,659
May I have this dance?

40
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,120
I know your husband doesn't like it,

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,836
But I want to.

42
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,186
What have I done?

43
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:15,410
You know what you've done.

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,149
<i>You</i> were doing the same.

45
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,648
Weren't you dancing with your arms around Anoushay's waist?

46
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,791
Anoushay's like my sister.

47
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,720
As if <i>he</i>'s my boyfriend!
-Stop it, Mehwish!

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,396
Shut up!

49
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,006
It's very natural.

50
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:36,260
Would the pain of it not kill me

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,254
If someone put his arms around my wife's waist?

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,404
These hands,

53
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:42,829
These arms --

54
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,267
This waist -- It's all mine.

55
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,200
I know I'm possessive.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,238
But what is love without possessiveness?

57
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,470
How long have you been married?

58
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,986
8 years.
-Oh.

59
00:02:58,986 --> 00:02:59,948
That's enough.

60
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,372
What do you mean, 'enough'?

61
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,182
It's enough

62
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,333
For a lovely lady like you to give a pleb

63
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,902
8 long years of her life.

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,126
I'm the luckier one, Mr Shehwar,

65
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,721
She's completed me.

66
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:14,821
I feel that I don't need anything else

67
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:17,316
When I've got her.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,490
Honestly, whoever would've gotten her

69
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,335
Would've said the same.

70
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,905
'I don't need anything else.'

71
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,014
Call your husband,

72
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:35,263
And ask him to take everything that I have,

73
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:38,208
And give me his Mehwish.

74
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,770
There's also a cheque for me.

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,854
I've also given you a car and a driver.

76
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,366
Don't say anything.

77
00:03:59,366 --> 00:04:01,919
You deserve all of it.

78
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,413
The money one deserves

79
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:07,067
Is his salary, and the money one doesn't deserve

80
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,187
Is his price.

81
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,584
I'm doing all of this for Rumi.

82
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,714
For his future.

83
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:15,662
And it was just yesterday

84
00:04:15,662 --> 00:04:18,711
That you thought his intentions aren't bad, that he's a good man,

85
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:22,220
So, why do you feel today that he wants to buy me with the job and the car?

86
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,470
My eyes had begun to trust him,

87
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,320
But my heart has not.

88
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,941
You're envying me, aren't you?

89
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:32,907
A man always wants the woman to live at his mercy,

90
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,203
Or regard him as a god.

91
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:37,497
My Mum used to say,

92
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:40,270
'It makes me laugh if a woman suspects a man',

93
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,820
'But it makes me tear up if a man suspects a woman'.

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,965
And honestly,

95
00:04:45,965 --> 00:04:49,547
Looking at you, I feel like tearing up.

96
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,896
People get on the wrong train in their hurry.

97
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:08,228
What do they do?

98
00:05:08,228 --> 00:05:09,860
Do they keep sitting?

99
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,230
Where'd they go if they kept sitting?

100
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,500
That is why they don't sit tight like you.

101
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,500
They wait for the next station, and get off the moment the train stops.

102
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:34,280
I want to get off at the next station, Shehwar.

103
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,350
You're not going to office, Mehwish.

104
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,274
Please, don't even <i>think<i> about it.

105
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,620
Would you beat me?

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,290
What are you saying?

107
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,000
Have I ever raised my hand on you?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,506
Look at your eyes.

109
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:07,289
It looks like you'd eat me alive.

110
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,402
Looking at you, it looks like you'd slap me!
-No way, Mehwish, I'd never do that!

111
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:16,657
You think you've sinned because of a trifling mistake; it's not like that.

112
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:19,479
Honestly, Danish?

113
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,443
We can't live together anymore.

114
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,250
The same old anger.

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,057
We'll talk in the morning --
-I'll say the same in the morning - <i>we can't live together</i>.

116
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,700
Crazy lass, I can't live without you.

117
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,230
But <i>I</i> can.

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,080
And I <i>want to</i>.

119
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,844
I'm fed up of this relationship.

120
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:56,634
<i>I had thought that with you by my side,</i>

121
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:59,385
<i>What else could I ever wish for</i>

122
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>My hope in life begins and ends with you;</i>

123
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,541
<i>What does it matter, if I don't have</i>

124
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:13,020
<i>Anything in this world;</i>

125
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,840
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

126
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,974
She's forgotten your 'love marriage',
<i>I was under the misbelief</i>

127
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:18,680
She's forgotten your 'love marriage',
<i>That I had you;</i>

128
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,410
And that you've got a son,
<i>That I had you;</i>

129
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,300
And that there were dreams the two of you cherished.

130
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,086
You may still cherish them, mate,

131
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:32,875
But she's jumped ship to fulfil them.

132
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,160
The relationship between a man and a woman is strange, Mr Shehwar.

133
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,180
As long as she's only got eyes for you,

134
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,182
She raises you to godliness;

135
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:48,270
The moment she turns her gaze away, she separates you from God.

136
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,700
<i>Teach me your ingenious skill</i>

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:00,320
<i>Of forgetting as you leave;</i>

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,850
<i>Efface every trace of your memory</i>

139
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,850
<i>From my life, now that you're leaving.</i>

140
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,360
Goodbye.

141
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:19,960
You seem to be a rather intelligent businessman,

142
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,510
But you surprised me when dealing here.

143
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,971
You were offering me 50 million

144
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,970
For a woman who's not even worth spare change.

145
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,915
For a woman who's not even worth spare change.
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

146
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:32,627
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

147
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:38,134
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

148
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,901
<i>Forsake your place in my heart,</i>

149
00:08:40,901 --> 00:08:43,600
<i>Gently and stilly;</i>

150
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,401
<i>Bless you with this parting,</i>

151
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,572
<i>Fare thee well.</i>

152
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:57,934
<i>Sometimes, it's nagging me,</i>

153
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:03,041
<i>And sometimes, making me weep.</i>

154
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,970
It is not in a woman's nature to be disloyal,

155
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,600
And one who's disloyal is unworthy of being called a woman.

156
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,646
See for yourself.

157
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,450
The three of us used to share a home.

158
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,881
Now, there's three different houses...

159
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,460
It's all because of that evil uncle.

160
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,633
It's all because of your Maman.

161
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,360
If she comes here,

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,036
Meet her.

163
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:34,226
Go along if she takes you.

164
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:37,944
You're not my strength, Papa, you're my weakness.

165
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,810
I've come here to invest.

166
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,785
How much money do you have?

167
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:41,990
How much money do you have?
-7.8 million.

168
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,778
Splendid.

169
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:45,460
So, my mate's been earning his riches, eh?

170
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,520
I've sold my flat.

171
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,816
Dad had bought it.

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,771
Will you marry my father?

173
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:21,037
It's been two hours and I haven't seen you.

174
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,150
I'll have mercy on your eyes tomorrow.

175
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,276
Tomorrow?

176
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:26,985
After the marriage?

177
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:29,190
I'm observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation] until then.

178
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,006
I'm observing the Mayoon [ritual of separation] until then. I won't meet you before that.

179
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:40,392
If I was laughing, it doesn't mean I was actually crying.

180
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:43,067
But I can cry for him, too.

181
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,441
And when I said I don't love him,

182
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:48,840
I mean that I don't.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,861
But I might as well be in love with him.

184
00:10:51,861 --> 00:11:00,133
What I don't get is whether it's proper for someone who's loved so intensely the first time to love a second time...

185
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,230
So, I say --

186
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,860
What is going on?

187
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,070
What the devil are you doing in my room?

188
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,716
How dare --

189
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,143
I want to meet you.

190
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,890
Please, don't do that, mate...

191
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,800
I won't be able to do that.

192
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,624
W -- Why?

193
00:11:56,624 --> 00:12:00,170
I've spent five months telling myself

194
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,740
And getting myself to believe

195
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,531
That I can't meet you now.

196
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:10,330
Can't even call out to you now.

197
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,398
Can't say, 'Mehwish',

198
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,652
'This button's fallen off my shirt'.

199
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,620
<i>Of vexed hearts,</i>

200
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,350
<i>The path is straight</i>

201
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,548
<i>Never is it</i>

202
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:31,569
<i>That they look back.</i>

203
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,466
<i>The strands of love,</i>

204
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:41,550
<i>The bond of loyalty</i>

205
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:50,022
<i>Once broken, can never be mended</i>

206
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:58,680
<i>To meet you once is all I ask for</i>

207
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:06,770
<i>Meet my gaze for once, and move away.</i>

208
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,728
I want to forgive her, too.

209
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:14,150
But then, I think of the Lord.

210
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,681
What do you mean?

211
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:21,045
Even the Lord does not forgive unfaithfulness to Him.

212
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,102
Dad used to say,

213
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:47,754
'If you want to see your Dad's childhood, look at your first son'.

214
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,957
'He's just like your father'.

215
00:13:49,957 --> 00:13:52,502
My Dad used to say the same.

216
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:54,631
In fact, when Rumi was born,

217
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:55,978
He said,

218
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,135
'Don't think of him as Rumi'.

219
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:01,150
'This little rascal's Akhtar Ahmed'.

220
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,390
'Even if I die, now, never think that I'm gone',

221
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,419
'For you will find me in him'.

222
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,230
And, honestly? I've never felt

223
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,266
That Dad's no more.

224
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,730
So,

225
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,310
Your 'Dad' had proposed your marriage to me,

226
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,541
And he wanted me to say 'Yes'.

227
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,650
No way.

228
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,378
He --

229
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,286
The bugger!

230
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,070
Bad word for Dad!

231
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,940
In that moment, he was just... <i>Dad</i>.

232
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,740
I looked into deeply into his eyes,

233
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:48,636
Felt his love as he asked for my hand in matrimony;

234
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:55,840
Felt, also, that he was as self-seeking as a father would be for his son,

235
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,195
Which is why I just couldn't refuse.

236
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,863
So, I accept the proposal.

237
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,068
I've even brought an engagement ring.

238
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,510
Please,

239
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,692
Put it on if you accept.

240
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,167
Please call me when you've put it on.

241
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,762
Otherwise, I'll take it

242
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:49,764
That you didn't listen to your Dad.

243
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,136
I felt she was right.

244
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,226
You'd be calling us,

245
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,030
But never calling upon us;

246
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,710
We'd talk about you,

247
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,390
But you'd never be there.

248
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:18,270
She'd be envious, wouldn't she?

249
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,082
It was Dad's flat...

250
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,122
She shouldn't have gone there.

251
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,452
<i>You</i> could've bought it.

252
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:38,782
You could buy the entire building.

253
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,750
I didn't want to buy it.

254
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,290
I wanted that someone <i>else</i> buy it and live there.

255
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,426
You're exacting your revenge?

256
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:51,094
By the Lord, I'm not.

257
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,433
I'm writing a story with the searing ink of my blood.

258
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:58,525
I'm writing, 'The choice to two-time was her right',

259
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:01,810
'And, having used her right in choosing that',

260
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,543
'She's lost every right she had over me'.

261
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,580
Yes?

262
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,350
What's his name?

263
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,003
Monty?

264
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,444
Okay.

265
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,890
Here's a glass of water.

266
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,440
Read this 7 times,

267
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,020
And when you have,

268
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,386
Blow over the glass 3 times,

269
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:02,796
And drink the water.

270
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,300
Hopefully, if the Lord wills so,

271
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,562
He'll be here.

272
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
