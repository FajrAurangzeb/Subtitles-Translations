1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,250
Sorry, mate.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,666
Sorry.

3
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,145
Are you blind?

4
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,052
Even if I am, can't you see?

5
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:50,674
Get a move on once the signal's turned green.

6
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,751
Don't you know how to talk to girls?

7
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,458
Do you know how to talk to boys?

8
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,801
You think of yourself as a boy?

9
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:00,985
Have some shame.

10
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:04,671
Why are you arguing, old fella?

11
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:06,312
The fault is yours.

12
00:01:06,312 --> 00:01:08,624
So I'm an 'old fella' to you, too!

13
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:10,954
Look at your own age! Get going.

14
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:13,624
Mind your own business.

15
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:19,160
So, what do you do

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,940
When she calls you at night?

17
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,696
Smoke a cigarette.

18
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,549
Not good.

19
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,837
What do I do?

20
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,055
Do you know what her tone's like?

21
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:33,022
You'd be inflamed to hear it.

22
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:35,333
It pains me to hear it.

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,415
Back when I didn't smoke,

24
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:42,229
I'd vent my anger on any employee.

25
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,461
I'd curse myself later -

26
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:47,112
'What was his fault'?

27
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,443
Just -- Don't answer her call.

28
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,740
I have to.

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,506
She's my business partner.

30
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:56,349
I want it all to end.

31
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,581
I want to live in peace, Mehwish,

32
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,694
Or rest in peace.

33
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:05,004
Please, sir.

34
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,639
Anyway,

35
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,786
This will go on at least until December.

36
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:14,322
Besides, December isn't all that far away.
-What's her problem?

37
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:18,003
If the business is doing well, why isn't life going on smoothly?

38
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,718
I know what the problem is,

39
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:23,556
But I can't tell anyone.

40
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:27,802
I feel ashamed to utter such a thing.

41
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,785
Okay, no problem...

42
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:32,519
What'd I do with it?

43
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,543
Right...

44
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:38,206
What'd you do with it?

45
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:53,251
What's this pill for?

46
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:57,501
I just have a slight headache...

47
00:02:57,813 --> 00:02:59,922
I'm boring you, right?

48
00:02:59,922 --> 00:03:02,704
No, not at all.

49
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:05,719
You may leave.

50
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,577
Go back to your room.

51
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:10,223
We'll meet again

52
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,559
When I get better.

53
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,965
No.

54
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:17,232
I'll leave only when you get better.

55
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,613
What are you made of, really!

56
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:24,872
Ordering around like this suits you.

57
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:29,298
Where were you all these years?

58
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,086
I'm afraid.

59
00:04:58,086 --> 00:04:59,794
Why are you afraid?

60
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:02,478
I will develop a habit of it -

61
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,605
You telling me not to smoke,

62
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,851
Pulling the cigarette from my mouth and throwing it in the dustbin,

63
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,072
Seeing you,

64
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:14,278
Being with you...

65
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,784
I'm right here, with you.

66
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,820
You're doing a job.

67
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,233
Who knows, one of these days, he may get angry and stop you,

68
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,976
And you may resign and leave.

69
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:28,023
I would never leave.

70
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,460
He can't stop me now.

71
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:47,472
Hello?

72
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,141
Yes.

73
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,688
I'm going home.

74
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,532
It's 5.

75
00:05:56,631 --> 00:06:00,175
I thought if you'd left before me.

76
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:03,109
Why, what happened?

77
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,880
I wouldn't be able to see it, mate.

78
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,323
There's something else I need from you...

79
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:13,617
Yes?
-But it's not a part of your duty.

80
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,646
Do it if you like,

81
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:18,212
Otherwise, just say 'sorry'.

82
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,993
Don't go anywhere.

83
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:22,228
I'm coming.

84
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,671
Satisfied?

85
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,656
Very.

86
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:13,016
Do you know

87
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,219
What I'd be thinking of on the way?

88
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,656
What?

89
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:19,766
Why you fell for a 'love marriage'.

90
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:21,240
Well...

91
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,220
Marriage can just happen,

92
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,927
But why did you ever fall in love with <i>him</i>?

93
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,646
Why is this first-aid box here?

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,870
Maman, Papa's shoes!

95
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,900
He's taken off his shoes here...

96
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,821
Danish!

97
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:57,909
Alright, to your room.

98
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,643
Danish!

99
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:04,361
Danish?

100
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:08,494
Danish! Get up, will you?

101
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,049
Mehwish?

102
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:11,146
Where's Rumi?

103
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:12,926
In the lounge.

104
00:08:13,222 --> 00:08:14,674
When did you come back?

105
00:08:14,674 --> 00:08:17,252
And why is the first-aid box lying in the lounge?

106
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:20,898
I got injured at a crossing...

107
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:22,238
Alright, get up, will you?

108
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,033
I want to show you something.

109
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:28,033
Come on already!
-Where to?

110
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:36,363
There!

111
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:38,051
Do you see that car?

112
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,410
Yes.

113
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,506
Guess whose it is!

114
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,368
Whose?

115
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,636
Mine!

116
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,280
What are you looking at?

117
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,823
I'm beholding your beauty.

118
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,536
Hey!

119
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,656
What's this wound on your neck?

120
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:34,093
There's one on my elbow, and another on my leg.

121
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,081
But you didn't see it last night.

122
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:39,224
I bumped into a car at a signal.

123
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:41,553
What were you thinking?

124
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:44,130
About you...

125
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,243
You didn't message me when leaving,

126
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:48,896
Nor did you answer my call.

127
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,018
I got the text.

128
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:52,611
'Happy first day in office'.

129
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:54,692
Thank you so much.

130
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:55,894
Alright,

131
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,175
Take a leave tomorrow.

132
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,016
Why?

133
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,369
We'll go to Rumi's school

134
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,441
For his admission.

135
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:06,384
Did you make this tea?

136
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:07,772
Yes...

137
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:10,851
Surely, you'll go there when you've gotten your salary?

138
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:11,850
Don't worry,

139
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,509
I'll ask for an advance.

140
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,372
As in, an advance salary.

141
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,925
Our maid would be here today.

142
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,158
In fact, she'd be here any moment.

143
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:23,862
She was asking for 10,000.

144
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,327
She said she'd cook, too.

145
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:28,017
<i>She</i>'d cook, now?

146
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,960
How would I cook, Danish?

147
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,066
If I'm at my office morning to evening,

148
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,690
I would much rather just have dinner!

149
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,251
Right...

150
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:40,251
I hadn't thought about that.

151
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,758
What else would he give?

152
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,227
Who?

153
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,769
My friend,

154
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,753
Shehwar, of course.

155
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,005
What else could he give?

156
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:53,837
He's given me a good job, a car, a driver...

157
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:54,833
And the necklace.

158
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,365
You forgot about that.

159
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,316
He'd given that, too.

160
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,909
He had, yes.

161
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,505
That's it?

162
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,364
'That's it', as in?

163
00:11:07,364 --> 00:11:11,535
If God is so benevolent to a woman, it feels proper,

164
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:15,581
But not when another man is.

165
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:17,300
What?

166
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,190
What are you saying?

167
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,985
Does it hurt you?

168
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,124
I don't know.

169
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:28,315
But it does hurt me very much.

170
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:30,263
I couldn't sleep all night.

171
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:33,311
I'd get up to look at you again and again.

172
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,203
Do you know why?

173
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:38,768
Just ask why.

174
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:39,513
Why?

175
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:42,593
I'd look at how invaluable you are,

176
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,592
Yet, someone wants to buy you

177
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,620
For a hundred thousand a month and a car.

178
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,870
Shut up, Danish.

179
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:57,262
It hurts to hear that, Mehwish,

180
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:59,498
It sounds as if I'm growing suspicious,

181
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:02,185
But I swear by you, I'm not.

182
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,529
I'm afraid.

183
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't feel bad that you should dream,

184
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,403
But I don't like it when someone <i>else</i> makes you dream.

185
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,654
I'm doing this for Rumi.

186
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,778
For his future.

187
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:20,720
And it was just yesterday

188
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,809
That you thought his intentions aren't bad, that he's a good man,

189
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,547
So, why do you feel today that he wants to buy me with the job and the car?

190
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,846
My eyes had begun to trust him,

191
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:34,621
But my heart has not.

192
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:39,720
Then, go to a doctor and get yourself treated.

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,685
You're envying me, aren't you?

194
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:45,907
Even after five years, you only have a salary to make ends meet,

195
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:48,990
And that banger of a bike.

196
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,654
That's why you feel bad, innit?

197
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:53,421
Typical men's mentality.

198
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,326
A man always wants the woman to live at his mercy,

199
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:59,453
Or regard him as a god.

200
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,702
My Mum used to say,

201
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:04,531
'It makes me laugh if a woman suspects a man',

202
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:08,027
'But it makes me tear up if a man suspects a woman'.

203
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:10,177
And honestly,

204
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:15,264
Looking at you, I feel like tearing up.

205
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:48,509
What else would he give?

206
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,711
What else could he give?

207
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:54,600
He's given me a good job, a car, a driver...

208
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,649
And the necklace.

209
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,138
You forgot about that.

210
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:59,038
He'd given that, too.

211
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,368
He had, yes.

212
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,415
That's it?

213
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,289
'That's it', as in?

214
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:09,211
If the Lord is so benevolent to a woman, it feels proper,

215
00:14:09,211 --> 00:14:13,476
But not when another man is.

216
00:14:30,215 --> 00:14:31,778
Good morning, Madam.

217
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:34,903
Good morning. Please, come in.

218
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,855
Over there.

219
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,156
Good morning, Ma'am.

220
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,223
The boss was asking about you.

221
00:15:27,304 --> 00:15:28,208
Alright.

222
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,864
He was asking you to come to his room first.

223
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,364
It's something important.

224
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,057
Alright, I'll be there.

225
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,340
What is this?

226
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,590
What is it, sir?

227
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,009
It says 'refused' here.

228
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,781
So you'd refused the request!

229
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:50,718
I hadn't, sir --
-As if I had!

230
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:55,015
You took the life of an old employee, and you're blaming someone else!

231
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:58,759
Sir, it was an issue over entitlement, and the HR --
-Get out!

232
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,838
Or admit it that your departmental procedures have taken a life.

233
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,307
A poor soul was dying because he didn't have

234
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,526
Some 7 or 8 million,

235
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,433
And you were busy

236
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,540
Thinking about his <i>entitlement</i>!

237
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,149
You 'saved' the company from a loss!

238
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:16,353
Listen!

239
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:19,404
All such applications will henceforth come directly to me.

240
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,993
Is it clear now?

241
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:23,040
Yes, sir.

242
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,598
Oh!

243
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,267
Come.

244
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:32,868
Why were you so furious?

245
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,676
What happened?

246
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:38,050
And why are you smoking?

247
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:44,000
I woke up to the news of Mr Mirza's death...

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,404
Who's Mr Mirza?

249
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,604
He was an old employee of the company.

250
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:52,082
A lung cancer patient.

251
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:56,191
He needed some 7 or 8 million for his transplant,

252
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,648
And these folks just sat about, thinking

253
00:16:58,648 --> 00:17:02,957
Whether he's <i>entitled</i> to it!

254
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:07,201
The wretches!

255
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:12,297
By the time the application reached me,

256
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,063
Mr Mirza was breathing his last...

257
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,765
You won't smoke now.

258
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:37,409
Sir!

259
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:39,986
You aren't feeling dizzy, are you?

260
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,614
No?

261
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,035
Got a headache?

262
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:44,895
No headache, either.

263
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,471
Why are you wearing these socks, then?

264
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:48,799
What socks?

265
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,346
My good sir, look at your feet.

266
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:54,356
Your socks don't look alike!

267
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,050
Mr Matin's told me.

268
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:31,197
Hey!

269
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,650
It's you!

270
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,829
I just came back from your room!

271
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,948
That's the problem...

272
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:43,980
The room is as glum as I am when you've come back from it.

273
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,167
Alright,

274
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,525
Let's go out.

275
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,073
Where?

276
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,573
Have lunch, of course.

277
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,531
You're worried

278
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:58,941
That if someone saw us, he'd think we're out on a date?

279
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:00,704
Alright,

280
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:02,954
I won't have lunch.

281
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:06,394
I can't see you worry.

282
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,893
Just a minute.

283
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,951
Why won't we have lunch?

284
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:20,333
I'm coming with you,

285
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:24,480
And I don't fear anyone.

286
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Yes, sir?

287
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:39,753
What could I have?

288
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:42,438
Lentils, vegetables, potatoes, <i>queema</i>, curry and rice...

289
00:19:42,438 --> 00:19:43,720
Which vegetables do you have?

290
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,772
Mashed aubergine, ladyfingers and <i>aloo bhujia</i>.

291
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:47,767
<i>Aloo bhujia</i>.

292
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:48,765
With two <i>rotis</i>?

293
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:50,031
Just one.

294
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,736
One <i>roti</i> and <i>aloo bhujia</i> to table no. 4!

295
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:03,370
Haven't you brought your lunch today?
-No.

296
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,915
I used to bring lunch too,

297
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:12,584
And I'd get caught when I did not.

298
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,162
Everyone would find out I'd had a domestic.

299
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:16,303
No.

300
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:17,693
It's nothing like that.

301
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,396
I haven't had a domestic.

302
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:21,607
We've hired a maid.

303
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:25,022
I can't bring myself to eat what she cooks.

304
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,917
Oh...

305
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,620
Yes, please.

306
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,756
That'd be enough.

307
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:46,803
Thanks.

308
00:20:46,803 --> 00:20:48,378
Welcome.

309
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,423
Didn't your wife call today?

310
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,897
She did.

311
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:01,052
But I got the news about Mr Mirza's death before that.

312
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:03,454
I didn't answer her call.

313
00:21:03,454 --> 00:21:06,147
Sometimes, it feels like you're a little kid.

314
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:08,021
Angry over a trifle one moment,

315
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,471
Giving in the next,

316
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:14,235
Delighted if someone came along for lunch.

317
00:21:14,235 --> 00:21:17,080
Not delighted, elated.

318
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,196
Has Rumi started school yet?

319
00:21:21,517 --> 00:21:23,471
No.

320
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:24,799
Why?

321
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,457
I'll go tomorrow.

322
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:30,327
I've asked Danish to take a leave.

323
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:33,455
So you're not coming to office tomorrow.

324
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,987
I don't know

325
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,768
How long it'll take.

326
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,935
Talk to me.

327
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:42,520
One call would get everything done.

328
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,237
But I'd have to be there.

329
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:45,519
I don't think so.

330
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,488
Ask Danish to take a leave.

331
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:52,333
He could go and let me know if there's any problem.

332
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,853
He won't talk to you.

333
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:57,089
What is it <i>now</i>?

334
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,143
His eyes had begun to trust you,

335
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:01,838
But not his heart.

336
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,260
'Heart' --

337
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,187
Jeez, mate, what kind of a man is he?

338
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:08,353
He'd create a big problem!

339
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:11,839
He'll keep doubting, suspecting...

340
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:15,894
And stop you one day, saying, 'Don't go to office'.

341
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:18,770
What would happen to me if you stopped?

342
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,225
Don't worry.

343
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,973
I'll come.

344
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,395
I know, hearing your words,

345
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,593
Looking at your kindness,

346
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:32,238
One does suspect you sometimes...

347
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:36,149
But I can't put my job in harm's way because of baseless suspicion.

348
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,708
What kindness are you talking about?

349
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:41,660
Shehwar, I'm talking about him --

350
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,883
He thinks --

351
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,338
That each of the car,

352
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,534
The salary,

353
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:50,336
And the necklace you've given me is kindness I don't deserve.

354
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:53,331
He thinks I'm not worthy of any of it.

355
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:56,551
The truth is, <i>he</i>'s not worthy of <i>you</i>.

356
00:22:56,551 --> 00:23:01,285
He doesn't know what he's got.

357
00:23:05,189 --> 00:23:06,034
Alright,

358
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:07,908
Don't get upset.

359
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,383
I'll do something.

360
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:12,008
He thinks I'm not worthy of any of it.

361
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:15,177
The truth is, <i>he</i>'s not worthy of <i>you</i>.

362
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:19,510
He doesn't know what he's got.

363
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,598
Yes --

364
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,428
I'd bought some dresses. I was trying them on.

365
00:25:35,428 --> 00:25:37,633
You've bought new dresses?

366
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:39,491
You didn't even tell me.

367
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:40,828
What could I tell you?

368
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,611
You've been quiet since you came back.

369
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,110
I wasn't quiet.

370
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,705
Didn't you see how I was laughing?

371
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:48,423
Show me.

372
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,001
Right...

373
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:55,349
Do you know what happened today?

374
00:25:55,349 --> 00:25:58,380
I went to the office wearing different socks on either foot.

375
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,533
Everyone was laughing at me.

376
00:26:06,427 --> 00:26:07,459
Here.

377
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:09,647
Lovely...

378
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,397
They're very beautiful.

379
00:26:17,397 --> 00:26:19,563
They must be expensive.
-Yes.

380
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:21,037
They're branded; of course,

381
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,499
They'd be expensive.

382
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:26,835
When should we go tomorrow?

383
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,913
You can leave around 8.

384
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,123
'<i>You</i> can leave'?

385
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:31,889
Do I have to go alone?

386
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:34,445
I couldn't get a leave, Danish.

387
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:35,664
In fact, take it as if

388
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:37,601
I didn't ask for a leave at all.

389
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,882
Honestly, I felt embarrassed.

390
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,412
Asking for a leave on my third day at work, you know...

391
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:44,898
I didn't feel it was right...

392
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:47,164
What's the big deal?

393
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:49,277
Shehwar's a friend.

394
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:52,585
It's not as if his office was running only because of you.

395
00:26:52,585 --> 00:26:54,994
You'd told me yourself

396
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:57,696
That both the parents have to be there for the admission.

397
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:59,431
There's some rule they have.

398
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,244
No, they don't.

399
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,157
They shouldn't have one, really.

400
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:06,150
Not every child's parents live with him.

401
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,399
One of them

402
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:10,669
May even be dead...

403
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:12,863
I've talked to the boss.

404
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:14,175
He says,

405
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:19,073
'Ask Danish to call me if he has any problem'.

406
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,269
You're still awake, aren't you?

407
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,160
No, I'm sleeping.

408
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,238
It's 2 a.m., Danish, this isn't a time for jokes.

409
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,010
I'm not joking.

410
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,269
I'm actually sleeping.

411
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:27,799
You're just bothering me, aren't you?

412
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:32,763
The light's on, and you're talking to me with your eyes shut.

413
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:37,770
That's how I've been sleeping of late, Mehwish.

414
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,266
I turn off the light,

415
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:40,939
Close my eyes,

416
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:44,239
And lie in pain.

417
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:49,302
It occurred to me today that I should leave the light on

418
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:55,583
And show you how much this new way of sleeping pains me.

419
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:02,653
What's the problem?

420
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:07,197
I want to tell you, Mehwish,

421
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:12,744
That I can't live a life supported by one Shehwar Ahmed.

422
00:29:12,744 --> 00:29:14,649
Even if I needed him,

423
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:19,092
I wouldn't call him at the time of the admission.

424
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,105
Alright, don't.

425
00:29:22,623 --> 00:29:26,029
Do you think I'm bad?

426
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:29,121
What you're saying is making me feel bad.

427
00:29:29,121 --> 00:29:32,669
You're feeling bad, aren't you?

428
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:36,027
But what I'm saying is not bad.

429
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:40,689
Why do we work at an office?

430
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:42,251
Why?

431
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:44,061
To run a house,

432
00:29:44,061 --> 00:29:46,715
Or to make it a home.

433
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,514
And what am I doing?

434
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:52,079
That's what I'm asking -

435
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,858
What are you doing, Mehwish?

436
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:57,939
I'm helping you make it a home.

437
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,764
And the man you call a friend but don't accept as one

438
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,281
Is silently supporting you.

439
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,464
But why is he supporting me?

440
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:07,078
Am I handicapped?

441
00:30:07,078 --> 00:30:10,034
Had I gone to him, begging?

442
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:15,028
And why is he offering all his support in <i>your</i> name?

443
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:19,716
And he's signed you a cheque for five hundred thousand?

444
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:23,730
And you'd gone to another bank to open an account?

445
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,199
I'd gone there

446
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,858
Because that bank had issued the cheque.

447
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,295
We wouldn't have to wait for two days to transfer the funds now.

448
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:35,970
Why didn't you tell me about the cheque?
-Because of everything you're saying now.

449
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,617
Do you think I don't know you haven't been able to sleep for the last few days?

450
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:41,043
Or that you're troubled?

451
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:44,138
I'm troubled because you are, too.

452
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:47,670
You've created a very negative image in your heart about Shehwar Ahmed.

453
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,401
Worse, you've begun suspecting me.

454
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:54,806
Tell me, how could I tell you

455
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:57,824
That he'd given me a cheque for five hundred thousand?

456
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,151
But why?

457
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,262
He hasn't done a favour.

458
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:04,835
He's given me five months' salary in advance.

459
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:07,358
Whatever's gotten into you!

460
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,041
That's how he is.

461
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:11,305
He was ready to sign a cheque for 8 million

462
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,870
To save the life of a sick employee.

463
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,383
But

464
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:19,915
Before the 8 million was sanctioned, he died...

465
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:22,930
Your problem is that a salary of a hundred thousand,

466
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,258
A car worth around 2 million, and a cheque for five hundred thousand matters to you.

467
00:31:26,258 --> 00:31:29,457
None of it matters to him,

468
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:34,909
Because he loves his staff with all his life.

469
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:40,877
Please, go to sleep.

470
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,565
Please, turn off the light.

471
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:04,705
Who looks after your son if both of you work?

472
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:05,859
The two of us.

473
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:08,625
But the two of you are at your offices.

474
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:12,001
You'd only have Saturdays and Sundays.

475
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,782
Yes...

476
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:15,701
So, that means

477
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:19,002
Your son stays with his grandparents?

478
00:32:19,002 --> 00:32:20,843
No.

479
00:32:20,843 --> 00:32:21,905
They're not here --

480
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:24,371
As in, they're no more...

481
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:25,843
Oh...

482
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,907
But we've hired a maid

483
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:29,905
To look after him.

484
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,106
You don't quite get it.

485
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:34,670
No, I got it.

486
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,826
You're talking about his home tuition, innit -

487
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:38,389
Who'll teach him,

488
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,379
Who'll check his homework, and the like...

489
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:41,562
I will, sure.

490
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:43,029
I'll teach him.

491
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:46,547
And my wife will, on Saturdays and Sundays.

492
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,155
And believe me, he's very intelligent.

493
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:52,138
He understands everything in a moment.

494
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,900
I guarantee you,

495
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,745
You won't have any complaints.

496
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:01,421
Your son's done very well on the test,

497
00:33:01,421 --> 00:33:03,511
But my question is the same -

498
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:06,700
Why didn't your wife come for your son's admission?

499
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,401
I mean,

500
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,653
It's her only son's admission,

501
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,717
Mothers are usually very emotional on such occasions.

502
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:16,230
Yes, she was very emotional.

503
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,448
But

504
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:19,122
She couldn't get a leave from her office.

505
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,059
She's just started working.

506
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:26,383
So...

507
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:27,678
He's been admitted, right?

508
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:31,102
Yes, he's been admitted.

509
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:41,425
Is the meeting over?

510
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,508
Yes, at last.

511
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:45,581
Well, there's good news for you.

512
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:46,912
What?

513
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:50,652
You've been appointed as Secretary to the Board of Directors.

514
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:51,849
Seriously?

515
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,690
Yes.

516
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:56,471
Thank you so much!

517
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:58,941
We're going to Islamabad.

518
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,146
Everything alright?

519
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:03,426
It's a business trip.

520
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,816
How long are we staying there?

521
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:09,395
We leave in the morning and come back in the evening.

522
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,174
Okay.

523
00:34:11,488 --> 00:34:15,398
So, talk to your husband today.

524
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,830
Talk about what?

525
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,284
You're going with me.

526
00:34:18,284 --> 00:34:22,784
You'll be going with me wherever I go.

527
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:27,190
What is it?

528
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,112
That's impossible.

529
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,504
What's impossible?

530
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:33,254
He --

531
00:34:33,254 --> 00:34:35,474
Won't let me go to Islamabad.

532
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:38,743
And with you? Never.

533
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:42,385
I'm sorry.

534
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:45,276
I'm really sorry.

535
00:34:45,276 --> 00:34:46,368
Look,

536
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,821
A foreign delegation's coming;

537
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:49,040
There's an important meeting.

538
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,588
It's very important that I go.

539
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,278
I understand, but I can't go.

540
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:56,604
He'd be mad with rage if he found out.

541
00:34:56,604 --> 00:34:58,431
Don't talk about him.

542
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,671
What do you want?

543
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:04,199
In fact, what does your heart want?

544
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,003
Okay.

545
00:35:07,003 --> 00:35:10,175
Call Mr Asim and tell him I'm not going to Islamabad.

546
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,928
The meeting's been cancelled.

547
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:13,739
Just a minute, sir, please.

548
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,068
I swear I have no issues.

549
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:17,909
I have no problem going with you.

550
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:21,117
But -- He's begun suspecting me.

551
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:23,366
He'd create a scene if he found out.

552
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:25,269
He won't find out.

553
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:27,614
We'll board a flight at 8 a.m.,

554
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:29,942
And come back by the 6 p.m. flight.

555
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:31,175
Just say that

556
00:35:31,175 --> 00:35:34,269
You'll be late on Monday.

557
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:35,239
Say that

558
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:38,378
There's a lot of work to do in the office; there's an important meeting.

559
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:41,426
He won't have the foggiest.

560
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:43,772
Still, if it's not possible,

561
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:47,989
Call Mr Asim and tell him.

562
00:36:05,004 --> 00:36:06,395
Just two more minutes.

563
00:36:06,395 --> 00:36:09,535
Still two minutes?

564
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:11,894
You're very hungry?

565
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:13,614
Very.

566
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:14,519
'Sec...

567
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,910
It'll be ready in a while.

568
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:21,551
And Maman's here!

569
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,170
What's going on?

570
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,557
I'm making an omelette for Rumi.

571
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:36,201
Didn't he eat anything?

572
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,243
How could he? Nothing had been cooked.

573
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,452
Hey!

574
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:41,602
Didn't she cook food?

575
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:44,043
The maid left at 12.

576
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,542
She called,

577
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,198
Telling that her Mum's been rushed to the hospital.

578
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:50,383
She said she had to go.

579
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:52,205
And you said, 'Go'?

580
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:54,352
What could I do?

581
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:56,102
Her Mum was at the hospital.

582
00:36:56,102 --> 00:37:00,666
Would I have stopped her here to have her cook?

583
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,432
Come here,

584
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,585
My sweet.

585
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:12,316
My son will sit here and have his omelette.

586
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,518
Maman's going to change and come, okay?

587
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:16,176
When did you come here?

588
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:17,584
I came back early.

589
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:18,864
So what are you doing now?

590
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,799
Preparing tea

591
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:23,583
For you.

592
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:56,086
Don't talk about him.

593
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:57,336
What do you want?

594
00:37:57,336 --> 00:38:01,356
In fact, what does your heart want?

595
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:18,204
He won't find out.

596
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:20,515
We'll board a flight at 8 a.m.,

597
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,906
And come back by the 6 p.m. flight.

598
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:24,123
Just say that

599
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:28,249
You'll be late on Monday.

600
00:38:36,776 --> 00:38:44,529
What about Rumi's admission?
-Why didn't you inform Asim.. ? He got the booking done.. Why?

601
00:39:08,849 --> 00:38:44,629
Yes, Mehwish?

602
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,239
When does the flight leave?

603
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,676
9 a.m.

604
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:19,049
And when's the return?

605
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:21,549
6 p.m.

606
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:25,975
I mean, when would we land in Karachi?

607
00:39:25,975 --> 00:39:28,225
Around 8 p.m.

608
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:31,995
Okay, thank you.

609
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,243
You're welcome.

610
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:35,244
Bye.

611
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
