1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,660
She didn't have her car, Papa. She'd come on a rickshaw.

2
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,320
She went back on a rickshaw, too.

3
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,894
It seemed like she'd come to say sorry.

4
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,330
Hello?

5
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,710
Watching TV?

6
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,120
No. I've just gotten home.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,630
So, you haven't heard the news, have you?

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,280
What news?

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,890
The FIA [Federal Investigation Agency] have arrested Shehwar Ahmed.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,550
His wife's snatched everything from him.

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,029
No comments?

12
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:03,937
No comments.

13
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,090
Alright.

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,680
Bye.

15
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,541
Bye.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,286
'No comments'.

17
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,460
You were right.

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,851
You've killed him.

19
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:33,162
He wasn't even delighted to hear that the man who ruined him

20
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:35,680
Is now behind bars.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,380
You're wrong there, Salman.

22
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,656
Shehwar hasn't ruined him.

23
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,900
I have.

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,066
You can't work for me.

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,222
I've --

26
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:56,283
Partnered with Danish.

27
00:01:56,953 --> 00:02:00,863
He sits in the same office, in the room just in front of my own.

28
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:02,503
But

29
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,160
Give me your address.

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,040
I'll try somewhere else.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,746
I'll let you know if something works out.

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,426
May I stay at your place tonight?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,934
Sure,

34
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,844
Why not?

35
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,125
No, Mehwish.

36
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:31,270
You can't stay here.

37
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,646
The grief I've seen on his face

38
00:02:33,646 --> 00:02:38,177
Won't allow me to keep you here at my home,

39
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:40,767
Nor is my heart willing to be so kind.

40
00:02:40,767 --> 00:02:42,828
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,910
If Salman had asked me before calling you here, I would just have refused.

42
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,821
For all that you've done, it's between you and the Lord.

43
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,300
But I swear by God,

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,866
You've insulted every woman out there who's loved.

45
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,136
Hey...

46
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,716
I've come to meet you.

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,460
I won't take too much of your time. I promise.

48
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,946
Thank you.

49
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,006
I was not myself the other day.

50
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:45,010
I said just about anything I could.

51
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,906
I'm sorry about that.

52
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,777
It's okay.

53
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,556
Thank you.

54
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,711
I've come to you because I think you can do something.

55
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,506
Like what?

56
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,248
That's what I'm thinking... Where do I start?

57
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,036
Is he marrying you?

58
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,580
It's just a guess -- I'm not doubting --

59
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,311
I just asked because I'd been wondering --

60
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,540
You answered the phone when I called Danish the other day, so...

61
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,140
I thought -- Perhaps...

62
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:41,552
I'd understand if you just said 'No' --
-No.

63
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,971
I knew it.

64
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,320
Know what, ours was a love marriage.

65
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,570
I used to think like him, too.

66
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,810
But I made some mistakes later.

67
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,360
I couldn't quite come up to his love.

68
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,490
He used to say,

69
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,530
'So what if we have a small flat'?

70
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,800
'So what if'

71
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,466
'I've just got a job to keep things going'?

72
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,726
'So what'

73
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:12,206
'If we don't have a car, or a big bank balance'?

74
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,800
'I've got you, Mehwish'.

75
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,690
'I don't need anything else'.

76
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,230
Surely, you didn't have a class?

77
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,330
No...

78
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,931
If I did, I would've met you after my class.

79
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,482
Oh...

80
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,250
So, I was saying...

81
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,830
I couldn't believe such love of his...

82
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,576
Today, I think

83
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,260
Why he wanted to stop me even after so much had happened.

84
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,090
Even on the day we got divorced,

85
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,228
He'd tried so hard to make me stop.

86
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:03,560
But I was already gone.

87
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,807
I didn't want to stop.

88
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:10,020
I admit that I was wrong.

89
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,390
But isn't it

90
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,206
Just human to err sometimes?

91
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:16,996
I won't believe that.

92
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:20,506
I don't allow a married woman

93
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,360
To commit such a 'mistake',

94
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,371
Much less a mother.

95
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,328
I wouldn't call it a 'mistake' if a mother did this.

96
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,029
I'd call it a 'sin'.

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,382
Don't men commit such mistakes?

98
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:42,382
I know scores of women who

99
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:45,250
Weep and wail for a few days, and forgive them.

100
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,280
They even accept them like they're squeaky clean!

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,430
My Dad used to say, 'Demand your rights from men',

102
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,510
'But never a share of <i>their</i> rights'.

103
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,340
So, do men have the right to make such 'mistakes'?

104
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,000
No.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,540
I didn't say that.

106
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,810
I said that it's easier for women to forgive.

107
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,980
Why?

108
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,497
Because men don't give birth from their wombs,

109
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,357
Women do.

110
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:24,630
It is her mercy and generosity

111
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,620
That defines lineages.

112
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,710
At least that's my point of view.

113
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,206
You may disagree.

114
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,430
But what happened so suddenly? You were married to Shehwar Ahmed, right?

115
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,970
We never got married.

116
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,630
He betrayed me.

117
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,190
His wife showed up right at the time of the marriage,

118
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,150
And he turned out to be a fraidy-cat.

119
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,536
What is your name? Hania?

120
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,699
Yes.

121
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,497
Right, Hania,

122
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:03,227
So, I was saying

123
00:09:03,227 --> 00:09:05,400
That it's for the better

124
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,150
That I've been punished for my sin.

125
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,680
You were right...

126
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,546
I've wronged him.

127
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,570
You've not wronged him.

128
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,810
You've wronged God,

129
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:31,196
For he used to entrust you to God when leaving you at home;

130
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,980
And you've wronged love,

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,081
Because love alone can give the courage to trust.

132
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,350
I need your help.

133
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,088
What did you say?

134
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,150
I said...

135
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,176
I need your help.

136
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,970
What good is asking for someone's help when your fight is against the Lord Himself?

137
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,150
And if you think that you've been punished for your sin,

138
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,310
Go and pray

139
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:18,036
To be saved from any further punishment.

140
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:24,526
Because as it happens, Mehwish, it is here that the punishment begins,

141
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:32,136
And He can be as infinitely ruthless as He is infinitely loving.

142
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:36,844
I've seen my Dad go through it.

143
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,326
Ideal: 18 Rupees,

144
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:46,997
Starwest: 9.80,

145
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,646
Nogia: 3.80.

146
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,666
And even Nasir Textiles has risen by 3.80 Rupees.

147
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:57,380
This share's fallen by 16 Rupees and risen by 0.10 only once in the last one and a half year, Salman.

148
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,976
Has he gone through the statement?

149
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,220
May I come in, sir?

150
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,017
Shut up, mate. Come.

151
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,956
Put out the cigarette, boyo.

152
00:11:21,956 --> 00:11:23,436
Please.

153
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,186
What are you doing?

154
00:11:32,186 --> 00:11:33,776
I'm paying homage to you.

155
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,207
You're the new <i>pundit</i> of the Stock Exchange.

156
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,907
My guide.

157
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,500
Look at this.

158
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,412
I haven't the foggiest about what's going on, Salman.

159
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,020
Don't think you haven't the foggiest.

160
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,720
Just look at how it suits you.

161
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,661
Who is it?

162
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,870
Tell me, who is it?

163
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,270
Be done with it and come out with it.

164
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,240
At least don't lie to your friend.

165
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,080
There's someone who's after you.

166
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,230
It impossible that a woman's not behind your success.

167
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,570
There's no one, mate. Really.

168
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,486
If I'm successful, it doesn't mean there's a woman behind my success.

169
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,466
No woman can ever be.

170
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,978
Then?

171
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:29,627
My son is behind my success.

172
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:31,760
He's my strength.

173
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,977
And Mehwish?

174
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,329
Get even with her.

175
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,676
How?

176
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:44,926
Fall in love with someone else and marry her.

177
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,976
Why are you laughing now, boyo?

178
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:52,970
I'm laughing at what you just said.

179
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,780
So, you haven't forgotten her yet, have you?

180
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,530
I forget her every day.

181
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,430
That's how I can sleep.

182
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,590
Haven't you seen

183
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,390
How I come to the office on time,

184
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,906
And I'm always fresh?

185
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,970
Alright, tell me,

186
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,280
If she came back, apologised,

187
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,950
Fell at your feet,

188
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,650
Talked about old love,

189
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,886
What would you do?

190
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,200
Riddling me this?

191
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,330
Yes.

192
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,110
A riddle of love?

193
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,206
A riddle of love.

194
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,630
What is it this time, boyo? Why are you laughing?

195
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,096
Let me tell you something from experience.

196
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,760
When love becomes a riddle,

197
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,240
It's no longer love.

198
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,760
And what you said about her falling at my feet, talking of old love...

199
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,230
That was the funniest part of it.

200
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,800
You silly bugger,

201
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
If you have to call it 'old love' like this,

202
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,316
Know that it wasn't 'love' in the 'good old days' either.

203
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,710
She

204
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,260
She wants to apologise.

205
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,281
She regrets it a lot.

206
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,866
Mehwish?

207
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,137
Yes.

208
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,498
I swear, her condition's really bad.

209
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:17,740
She doesn't have a job or a place to stay.

210
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,800
She's ruined,

211
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
Helpless and hopeless.

212
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,030
Where'd you see her?

213
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,230
She'd come to my place.

214
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,500
She wanted to stay there for the night, but Ayesha refused.

215
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,720
Oh.

216
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,980
Could you forgive her?

217
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,910
Sure, why not.

218
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,980
Just ask her to ask forgiveness.

219
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,930
Right.
-What are you doing?

220
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,860
Calling her, of course.

221
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,710
Calling her, of course.
-No.

222
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,737
Wait.

223
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:46,007
Riddle me this - would it solve her problems if I forgave her?

224
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,028
Obviously.

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,020
Then, don't have me talk to her.

226
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,220
Just call and tell her

227
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,516
Just call and tell her that I've forgiven her.

228
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,391
By the Lord, I've forgiven her.

229
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,016
She'd come to meet me today.

230
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,517
Who?

231
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,946
Mehwish.

232
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,820
Splendid.

233
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,750
Why?

234
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,250
Tell me.

235
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,331
Why had she come to meet you?

236
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,627
She felt

237
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:41,412
That there was something going on between us

238
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:43,620
And that I may marry him...

239
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,397
What?

240
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:49,380
Well, one can venture a guess...

241
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,310
The other day,

242
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,566
When she'd called Danish, I'd answered the phone.

243
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:57,100
<i>We</i> know why I'd answered his phone.

244
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,386
What did you say?

245
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,310
I said, 'No',

246
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,660
'It's nothing like that'.

247
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,590
Even if it is, how is it <i>her</i> problem?

248
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,980
One can't even control the man one's got.

249
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,110
She hasn't even got him anymore.

250
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,100
What are her fears about him?

251
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,950
Actually, she's disturbed.

252
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,490
Shehwar's left her.

253
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,356
The poor woman's come back humiliated.

254
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,407
He betrayed her.

255
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,720
'Poor woman'?

256
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,580
In that case, the 'poor woman' must be very sad.

257
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,150
She's been so unfortunate...

258
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,640
Her heart's broken...

259
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,480
'Poor woman'...

260
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,280
Be done with it, Watira.

261
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,050
Don't mock someone like that.

262
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,760
Be done with it, will you?

263
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,380
'Poor woman' is not such a worthless expression that it'd be okay to use it for Mehwish.

264
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,980
You're a teacher, mate.

265
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,260
Don't you feel ashamed when calling her a 'poor woman'?

266
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,530
Looking at her, I feel mercy for her.

267
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,890
She wanted to cry so much before me,

268
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,806
But she couldn't.

269
00:17:00,806 --> 00:17:03,007
She must be thinking

270
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:06,058
Why she's crying after all this time.

271
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,090
Please, Watira.

272
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:14,202
I was actually pitying her.

273
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,990
Danish wouldn't have answered her call, right?

274
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,926
No.

275
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:20,179
She never called him.

276
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,190
When I asked her, she said, 'How could I call him'?

277
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,250
She would, now.

278
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,186
Why?

279
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:29,450
Jeez, mate,

280
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,119
She'd come to check on you.

281
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,577
Now that she knows

282
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,996
That you're not in the way,

283
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,366
She'd call him.

284
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:39,590
You'd taken the SIM out of Dad's phone

285
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,340
To clear her way, right?

286
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,660
So she can go straight home,

287
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,450
And Danish can pull her into an embrace, saying,

288
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,590
'Where were you all this time, Mehwish'?

289
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,240
'I've been waiting for you'.

290
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,030
So,

291
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,550
Your job's done.

292
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,697
But you'd better stand firm, too.

293
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,947
Even if you fall in love with him,

294
00:17:57,947 --> 00:18:01,054
Never install Dad's SIM in his phone.

295
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,580
As if I'd fall in love with him.

296
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,720
Splendid. How and when did you think that?

297
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,470
When you took the SIM out,

298
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,380
When you laugh like that at the mention of 'love',

299
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,471
And how you quieten after laughing, like right now.

300
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,541
Well,

301
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,990
It's good that you did what you did.

302
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,120
Trampled your heart to help a grieving person.

303
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,372
You let her go to him.

304
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,490
But promise me,

305
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,060
If he turned away and came to you,

306
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,510
Don't say to him,

307
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,370
'I don't love you'.

308
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,378
You'd be losing on a lot.

309
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,630
Listen!

310
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,690
For now, sit back and think.

311
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,916
Tell me later.

312
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,521
Hello?

313
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,670
Hello?

314
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:08,651
Hello?

315
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,776
Danish...

316
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,776
Yes, it's me. Who is it?

317
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,420
So you've deleted my number, too?

318
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,239
Mehwish?

319
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,167
Wh -- What happened? Why are you crying?

320
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,490
How are you?

321
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,676
I'm fine.

322
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,166
Do you want to talk to Rumi?

323
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,666
No.

324
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,636
I want to talk to you.

325
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,770
Sure.

326
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,536
Go on.

327
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,836
I want to meet you.

328
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:18,546
Please, don't do that, mate...

329
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:21,706
I won't be able to do that.

330
00:21:22,486 --> 00:21:24,099
W -- Why?

331
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,060
I've spent five months telling myself

332
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,690
And getting myself to believe

333
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,430
That I can't meet you now.

334
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,160
Can't even call out to you now.

335
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,310
Can't say, 'Mehwish',

336
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,986
'This button's fallen off my shirt'.

337
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,927
Danish...

338
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,360
Please, Mehwish,

339
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,850
Don't say my name like that.

340
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,160
I'd feel

341
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,397
That you're somewhere around here. With me.

342
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:12,985
No -- You're nowhere...

343
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,800
I never thought that I'd ever see you again.

344
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,660
That you'd come to meet,

345
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,020
And leave again.

346
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,850
I won't leave.

347
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,770
And if I did, grab my hand and stop me.

348
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,026
I swear by you,

349
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,026
I won't.

350
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,040
I'd stopped you.

351
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,400
I'd said, 'Please don't go'.

352
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,470
I'd sworn too.

353
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,007
Don't you remember?

354
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,110
That's all I remember.

355
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,250
I'm scared ever since.

356
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,300
'Don't go'... I don't say that to anyone.

357
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,396
Nor do I say that the one who's gone will come back.

358
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,180
But I still remember you.

359
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,870
I miss you sometimes.

360
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,530
I miss you very much

361
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:18,087
When one proudly talks of love, or the vows of loyalty in love.

362
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,593
Bye.

363
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,200
<i>Of vexed hearts,</i>

364
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,990
<i>The path is straight</i>

365
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,140
<i>Never is it</i>

366
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,860
<i>That they look back.</i>

367
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,010
<i>The strands of love,</i>

368
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:53,260
<i>The bond of loyalty</i>

369
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:02,510
<i>Once broken, can never be mended</i>

370
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:10,271
<i>To meet you once is all I ask for</i>

371
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:19,216
<i>Meet my gaze for once, and move away.</i>

372
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,700
Hi.

373
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,900
What are you doing in the kitchen?

374
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,196
Hello. Brewing coffee for you.

375
00:24:52,196 --> 00:24:53,730
Brimming with love for you.

376
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,580
Brimming with love, or are you fearing me?

377
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,600
That's how it is, Salman.

378
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,092
One bad woman

379
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:05,722
Insults ten good ones with her deeds.

380
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:10,010
That's why I'd refused to let her stay here for the night.

381
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,420
I don't even want to be in the company of the disloyal.

382
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,607
Shut up, mate, what are you saying!

383
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:18,186
But

384
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:20,266
You're right.

385
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:23,730
I believe there aren't many women like Mehwish.

386
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,720
But when you've met one, you grow to suspect many.

387
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,390
Innit?

388
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,970
Anyway,

389
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,640
What did you do?

390
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,247
I've fit her in.

391
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:34,867
Got her a job.

392
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,550
She's got a room in a working women's hostel, too.

393
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,436
I wanted to give her some money, but she didn't take it.

394
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:42,466
And when I got up to leave, she seized my hand and said,

395
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:45,246
'Help me be forgiven'.

396
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,790
Did you talk to him?

397
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,527
Yes.

398
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:51,300
I did.

399
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,020
Did you talk about forgiving her?

400
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,867
I did.

401
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,428
He didn't agree, did he?

402
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:01,279
He agreed immediately.

403
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,720
He said, 'Just tell her I've forgiven her'.

404
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,480
'By the Lord, I've forgiven her'.

405
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,050
Then, he picked up his bag

406
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,296
And left.

407
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:14,350
Know what, I was with Mehwish all day.

408
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,800
Even had lunch with her.

409
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,010
She used to be my best friend at the University.

410
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,830
I used to skip breakfast to have breakfast with her.

411
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,127
Don't you remember

412
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:30,855
That that's why we used to be together at the canteen in the morning?

413
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,116
I was so fond of her,

414
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:37,006
But I felt today

415
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:41,346
That I'm a <i>Brahmin</i> having lunch with an untouchable.

416
00:26:42,677 --> 00:26:45,736
When I got up, she said, 'Please, sit a little longer',

417
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:49,527
And when I did, she started asking odd questions.

418
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:52,617
Such as?

419
00:26:52,617 --> 00:26:53,670
She said,

420
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:56,200
'Someone had deceptively trapped my love',

421
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,500
'But what happened to Danish's love'?

422
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,616
What does it mean?

423
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:03,500
As in, 'Why doesn't Danish love me anymore'?

424
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,380
Blimey, why should he?

425
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,580
As if love is some duty!

426
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,880
So, you can run away,

427
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,211
And he should just keep chanting your nam --
-Just a minute, Salman.

428
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:14,700
Pay attention to her question.

429
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,140
You won't be able to answer it in anger.

430
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,190
Just try to understand what she's saying.

431
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
She's saying

432
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,210
That Danish will always honour his vows of love.

433
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,650
Why is she saying that?

434
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,630
Hold on.

435
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,730
Remember -

436
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,477
In the beginning, it didn't matter to you what I said in response to your messages.

437
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:33,559
Do you remember?

438
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,670
I'd even complained against you in our third semester.

439
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,086
Told the Dean, 'I'm afraid of him'.

440
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:43,170
Showed him all your messages, too.

441
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,744
Ah, that...

442
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:49,180
And the Dean had called me to his room and thrown the worst four-letter words he could.

443
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,646
And on the day of my wedding, he whispered, 'I'm sorry'.

444
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:52,700
Leave the wedding be.

445
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Just stop

446
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,530
At the time I didn't love you.

447
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,440
Remember that you'd told Danish,

448
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,120
'So what if she doesn't'?

449
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,550
Remember?

450
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,086
Yes.

451
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:04,568
You'd also said,

452
00:28:04,568 --> 00:28:06,340
'I love her',

453
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,110
'And that's all that matters to me'.

454
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,310
Correct me if I'm wrong.

455
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,500
No.

456
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,200
You're right.

457
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,090
I'd said it.

458
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,130
Why?

459
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,880
If it didn't matter to your love that I didn't love you,

460
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,769
Why should it matter to Danish that Mehwish doesn't love him?

461
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,330
Know what,

462
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,571
You're very intelligent.

463
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,867
Ain't I?

464
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:38,210
Actually,

465
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,211
You're not.

466
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,940
You said I'm not intelligent?

467
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,986
Oh, do you mind it?

468
00:28:48,986 --> 00:28:50,716
Sorry, mate.

469
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,220
Why did you say it?

470
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,966
Should I say it?

471
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,106
Okay.

472
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,000
Why did we

473
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,220
Get married?

474
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,640
Because I'd fallen in love with you, too, Salman.

475
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,390
But why was it necessary to get married?

476
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,162
I mean, wasn't it enough that we'd fallen in love with each other?

477
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:14,200
What kind of question is that, Salman?

478
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,267
I'd been listening to your speech for 15 minutes.

479
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:18,580
Did I say, 'What kind of question is that, Ayesha'?

480
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,780
Alright, go on.

481
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,990
What?

482
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,678
I've asked you. You tell me.

483
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:23,980
Why did we get married?

484
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,370
Because socially and religiously, we're required to get married to be together.

485
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,300
We're required, sure,

486
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,746
But it's not like love cares about this fuss.

487
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:34,740
Honestly,

488
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,690
Who've you been reading of late?

489
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,400
For many days, Danish,

490
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,730
And Mehwish, for a while.

491
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,420
I can tell you why we get married

492
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,070
Even when we fall in love.

493
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,230
We gather everyone that day,

494
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,060
And tell everyone that we've chosen each other,

495
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,687
And that we're not available for anybody else. Am I right?

496
00:29:56,687 --> 00:30:00,079
Right, but --
-Let me answer that 'but' too.

497
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,186
'But',

498
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:03,830
'She made a mistake'.

499
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,080
She forgot

500
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,040
That she'd signed a social and religious bond to live together.

501
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,880
Or

502
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,945
She had to break that bond

503
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,726
For a better opportunity.

504
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,220
She broke it.

505
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,826
Made a mistake.

506
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:21,340
She'd apologise.

507
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,860
Sacrifice herself.

508
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,440
How would the world go on like that?

509
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,850
There are opportunities at every step, Ayesha.

510
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,810
Each better than the last.

511
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,966
If I took a liking to someone else,

512
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,077
Or you fell for someone else,

513
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:40,016
You'd meet me after a few days,

514
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:41,906
And say, 'I made a mistake';

515
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,320
I'd say, 'It's okay',

516
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,190
'Go home; I'm coming'.

517
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,210
My mistake would go on for but a few days.

518
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,540
So, Ayesha Salman Ibrahim,

519
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,350
How would the world go on like this?

520
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,290
Wow...

521
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,840
I'm just talking about the social commitment,

522
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,550
Or the religious bond.

523
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,680
I haven't even started about love.

524
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,040
Love is for the blind.

525
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,470
It's a game

526
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,670
Where one doesn't see anything except the one.

527
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,260
But suddenly,

528
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,220
If one of them started seeing someone else,

529
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,320
It opens the eyes of the other.

530
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,351
His eyes have been opened, Ayesha.

531
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:27,451
He won't be blind for Mehwish again.

532
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,540
How do you fall asleep without me?

533
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,677
In the beginning, I couldn't, Maman. When I went to the hostel, I'd stay awake all night.

534
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,870
My dear...

535
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,660
That's why my results were so bad.

536
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,990
But when Miss Hania found out that my Maman isn't with me,

537
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,860
She explained to me that there are thousands of kids in the world

538
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,011
Whose Maman is not with them.

539
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:58,390
So you've told Miss Hania that your Maman is no more?

540
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,340
I told her that she's fine,

541
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,220
But she isn't with me.

542
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,970
Does she meet your Papa?

543
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,350
No, they just talk over the phone.

544
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,400
Everyday?

545
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,410
No, just sometimes.

546
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,740
Now, they won't even talk over the phone.

547
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,640
Why?

548
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,570
Her phone's switched off.

549
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,680
I've been trying for two days.

550
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,200
Why do <i>you</i> try?

551
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,366
Nothing really, Maman. I like her a lot.

552
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,600
You don't like me, do you?

553
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,460
Not way -- You're Maman, after all.

554
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,200
Why don't you call me, then?

555
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,026
I'm angry with you.

556
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,427
And how long will you be angry with me?

557
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:42,350
Honestly?

558
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,637
As long as Papa's angry with you.

559
00:32:47,637 --> 00:32:48,838
Why are you laughing?

560
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:50,980
Guess what happened one day

561
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,446
Back when we lived in the flat?

562
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:56,400
You'd left by then.

563
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,920
Papa came back in the evening

564
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,950
And called out,

565
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,450
'Mehwish'!

566
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,370
Have you ever called out to him like that?

567
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,447
No, right?

568
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,250
And then?

569
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:50,790
She started crying.

570
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,850
I know why she was crying.

571
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,020
Why?

572
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,616
Because she's begun to miss us.

573
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,080
She lives in a hostel.

574
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,176
I know.

575
00:34:09,566 --> 00:34:11,256
Go and meet her.

576
00:34:11,256 --> 00:34:12,886
Everyday?

577
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,940
Yes.

578
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,650
Everyday.

579
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,096
She said sorry.

580
00:34:18,096 --> 00:34:23,306
She said before disconnecting, 'Tell Papa I'm sorry'.

581
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:31,408
You used to say that quarrels end when one says sorry.

582
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:36,485
She'd called you, too.

583
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,245
Yes.

584
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:42,490
Didn't she say sorry to you?

585
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,320
She did.

586
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,800
Then?

587
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,960
What?

588
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,007
The quarrel ends now that she's said sorry.

589
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,250
I'll tell you

590
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,740
When you're older

591
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,326
That there was never any quarrel between the two of us.

592
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:10,210
There was a bond between us,

593
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,230
Breaking which is a sin.

594
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,530
One says sorry

595
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,210
When one commits a mistake.

596
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,630
But there's no forgiveness

597
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,900
For a sin.

598
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,530
So, would she never be forgiven?

599
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,490
She'd be forgiven

600
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,710
The day I forget her.

601
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:35,340
Then, just forget her, Papa.

602
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,840
Please.

603
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
