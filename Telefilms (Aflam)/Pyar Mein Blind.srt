1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,455
Lemme work at Ayesha's firm. She's paying so well!

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,917
And I stay home? No way.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,595
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... I'm comin' over to your place tomorrow!

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:13,438
You're introducing Curtis to your wife... And he won't have a clue!

5
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:19,700
The name's Curtis. Top tyke in town! I know a rotter when I see one!

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,239
Your name, please?

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,119
Yes, please.

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,850
I asked you who that is.
-Ka -- Kashif's friend...

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,470
Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.
-Yeah?

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,421
Why do I get a feeling your wife's down here?

11
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,722
Stay away from her! She's a witch, I tell you!

12
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,542
Don't worry, laddie, I've got one at home too.

13
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,723
Aren't we bros?
-Doesn't quite look like it...

14
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:42,570
He's lame and that's his wife!
-He's blind and that's his wife!

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,900
To the dickens with you!
-Hey!
-I -- Ow!

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,410
Wives always get beaten about... Break my heart but not my bones!

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,417
'Blind Love'

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,338
Good morning!

19
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,398
'Morning...

20
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,839
Your breakfast, Madame.

21
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,290
I would've made something for myself -- Why'd you -- ?

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,693
You do everything six days a week. You deserve a day off.

23
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:36,358
You go to work six days a week too. Take care of my needs... Comforts... You deserve a day off too.

24
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,634
Hold on...

25
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,838
Comforts? Here?

26
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,024
Please, Zoya... You left your comforts behind...

27
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:53,119
I mean... The daughter of the owner of Siddiqui and Co., choosing to marry a middle-class man like myself... Angering her father... Leaving her luxuries behind...

28
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,971
Love demands sacrifices, Mr Marlin Munro.

29
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,419
So, no regrets.

30
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:02,859
Thank you.

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,693
Breakfast? It's getting cold!

32
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,437
Thank you.

33
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,945
And aye... How 'bout going out for lunch?

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,206
No way you're wasting another penny!

35
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,810
Using the AC's cost us so much already.

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,216
For God's sake, Zoya... These words don't suit you.

37
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,870
(They suit me.) For now, though, I've got the money!

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,649
Just save it for later!

39
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:33,444
Besides, all the diners are closed. Thanks to the Coronavirus.

40
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:38,914
Guess what, I've got this friend who knows the right palms to grease. We're going to his diner!

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,085
You gonna finish your breakfast or want me to...?

42
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,113
Kashif!

43
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,372
Kashif!

44
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,642
Get up! C'mon!

45
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,878
2 Gee. I want it right now.

46
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,852
Where's your gun?

47
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,099
Gun?

48
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,604
I thought all the robbers carried one.

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,170
No -- It's just -- Zoya wants to go out for lunch... And I haven't got my salary yet...

50
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,888
Make her a nice big omelette for now and be done with it. Simple.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,048
A nice big omelette, eh?

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,330
Seriously, Kashif? You've been staying here for weeks. Have I asked you for a penny? Like, ever?

53
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,560
The same old line you say at least ten times a month to rob me of 2 gee every time, which you never return!

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,320
Well --
-Would've been better if I paid you a rent instead!

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,926
Forget the rent... Just 2 gee? Your mate's honour's on the line!

56
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,678
Yeah?

57
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:10,270
Maybe next time you'd want to check your wallet before taking her out for lunch...
-Could you just check yours for now?

58
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,711
It's all I've got for now --

59
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,492
It's all I've got for now --
-Aye...

60
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,653
Aye... It'll do!

61
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,053
Marlin!

62
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,299
A 'thank you' couldn't hurt all that much, could it?

63
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,926
Not now!

64
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,082
Marlin!

65
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,920
<i>I</i> gotta thank <i>you</i>?

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,820
Osman's wounded her...

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,230
She's broken... Completely...

68
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,060
Why don't you rid yourself of this burden?

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,641
Mum says once a girl's married --

70
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,279
Jesus...

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,660
It's been a year since Zoya's marriage... Marlin would've demanded money if he was after it!

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,138
You don't know how patient these middle-class folks can be...

73
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:13,120
The day the lights go out of my eyes... Everything that's mine... Will be his...

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,068
I don't know it? Seriously?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:31,418
In case you've forgotten, Mr Siddiqui... Before hitting the jackpot, you were no more than a middle-class folk yourself...

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,301
Don't tell me you haven't mixed some water in your shampoo to squeeze every last drop out of it!

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,850
Hey! Keep your voice down!

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,651
Big deal!

79
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,871
You shouldn't forget your past like that...

80
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:56,849
You shouldn't forget how hard I've worked all these years... It ain't just about a jackpot or something!

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,479
Big deal, Mr Siddiqui!

82
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,369
You won the money but lost your daughter's love.

83
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,489
Fathers sacrifice everything for their daughters.

84
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay...

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,811
I'll forget everything if Zoya leaves that Marlin bloke...

86
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,670
Blimey, he's her husband!

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,170
Not to me!
-Okay...

88
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,807
Guess I gotta sort a few things out too...

89
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,281
I want no complaints.

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,691
Hey!

91
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,481
Not cricket!

92
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,722
That will be all...

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,448
Blimey...

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,658
After you!

95
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,478
Told you no one's gonna be around!

96
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,898
Aye, but I would've liked it better at home... But you wanted to go out for lunch...

97
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:11,919
No, Zoya... I really want to see you happy... Don't spoil my mood now...

98
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,450
You really want to see me happy, right?

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,778
Yes!

100
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,381
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

101
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,912
Shh!

102
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,227
We've talked about it and you know my decision.

103
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:32,162
What's your problem?
-Zoya...

104
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,157
It's about my self-respect!

105
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,959
Like, d'you expect me to stay home? No way!

106
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,249
Guess what your Dad's gonna say? 'He'S LiViNG oFf HiS WiFe'. No way I'm gonna take it quietly!

107
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,529
Your phone's ringing.

108
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,011
Who is it?
-Uhh...

109
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,480
My boss... I'll be right back!

110
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,058
Hello?
-Aye...

111
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:42,288
Martin Munro? Sorry -- Marlin Munro...

112
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,061
Aye...

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,386
It's...

114
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,056
Curtis from NBFUK...

115
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,238
Good day, sir...

116
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,948
You're the Bacon Rind Heap Of Coke, in'cha?

117
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,709
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

118
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,200
You've been...

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,090
You've been... Most kind,

120
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,540
You've been... Most kind, sir...

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,608
I'm comin' over tomorra!

122
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,198
Sir?

123
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,728
Why?

124
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,108
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

125
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:35,088
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

126
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,458
Okay...

127
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,721
When are you coming?

128
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,800
Loike I need an appointment!

129
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll drop by chicken pen I wanna!

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,951
See you!

131
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:50,642
Okay...

132
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,193
Bye...

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,370
WhEN aRe yOU CoMiNg?

134
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,111
Get me sum Ten Furlongs!

135
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,499
Wow...

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,808
What is it?

137
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,350
Nothing... Why?

138
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,501
You look worried... Since your boss called, you know?

139
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,081
Do I?

140
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,500
No?

141
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,581
It's nothing, really...

142
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,661
I was just thinking...

143
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah?

144
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,860
How...

145
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,118
Backward I am!

146
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:11,469
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

147
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:17,199
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

148
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,780
Yeah?
-Hmm...

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,602
Your friend who runs that firm --
-Ayesha.

150
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,253
Ayesha.
-Aye, Ayesha!

151
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:33,090
Why don't you call her? You can start tomorrow. Fine by me.

152
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,361
What happened so suddenly?

153
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,070
Nothing... I just really want to see you happy, Zoya. And you're happy, right?

154
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,460
Of course.
-So am I.

155
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,108
Enjoy!

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,968
Tried this?

157
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,978
What's up?

158
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,249
What I should've done long ago...

159
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,799
What?

160
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm going...

161
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,250
To Karachi...

162
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,517
To my daughter's...

163
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,650
I can't live away from her anymore.

164
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,458
You'd go against me?

165
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,220
No... Only against your bull-headedness.

166
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,230
I got a ticket for you too...

167
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,851
In case you have second thoughts tonight...

168
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,919
And yeah...

169
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,830
If you didn't come with me, don't expect me to come back.

170
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,690
You can live the life you want in this palace, all by yourself...

171
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:24,168
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

172
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,671
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

173
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,610
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

174
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,769
Shh!

175
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,430
I was just thinking...

176
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,959
Yeah?

177
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,940
How...

178
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,870
Backward I am!

179
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,138
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

180
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,568
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

181
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm comin' over tomorra!

182
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,347
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

183
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,320
This one'd fit three of me! What were you high on?
-No way?

184
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,948
What?

185
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,141
Someone else's size?

186
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,990
No way... No woman can be this big!

187
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,970
I've spent five months' savings on it!

188
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:43,411
No way I'm getting another. You're gonna fix this one.

189
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,611
Who could be this big?

190
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,598
Zoya!

191
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,008
Zoya!

192
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,129
C'mon, mate! Get up! Get ready!

193
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,829
C'mon!
-What is it?

194
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,279
Don't you have to go to work?

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,018
I'm starting next week...

196
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,030
What? Next week?

197
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:54,258
What's wrong with you? Stop shouting!
-What's wrong with <i>you</i>? You've got this job and you're putting it off!

198
00:16:54,258 --> 00:17:00,078
Do you have any idea how many people struggle to get a decent job?

199
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,188
Never thought you'd be so thankless!

200
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,918
Actually, no... My bad...

201
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:11,588
You're used to having servants!

202
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:16,901
How can you handle the pressures of a 9-to-5 job, a boss, and yeah, office politics?

203
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,850
This ain't for you, mate?

204
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,868
Seriously? That what you think?

205
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:25,429
You're forcing me...

206
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,108
Well then, I'm about to prove you wrong!

207
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,328
Really?

208
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,390
Aye!
-Get ready then! Double time!

209
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,318
Make me proud!

210
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,538
Thank goodness...

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,368
Zoya!

212
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:57,408
Zoya!

213
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:58,550
Zoya!

214
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,969
What now?

215
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,749
Sanitiser...

216
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,348

Thanks to me Mum and Dad who left me this place.

Or a blind man like me

273
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,985
Wouldn't have a roof over his head.

Roof over yer 'ead, eh?

278
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,440
Hardly the first time I've heard that one, kid.

This emotional blackmail ain't gonna Kathy Burke on me.

Sir?

282
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,028
Why don't you sell this place,

283
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,221
Get an apartment

284
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,968
And invest whatever's left?

285
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,538
Better than living off charity, innit?

286
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,307
This place

287
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,790
Is my last hope...

288
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,368

My type have got no one in the world.

The times, they're rotten!

292
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,528
What if I bumped into a fraud?

293
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,614
I'd have nowhere left to go.

294
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,927
Nowhere left ter go, aye.

295
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,678
If you're done with the questions, could I hear the good news?

296
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:13,080
News that your charity's gonna gi -- I mean... Support me?

We ain't done yet, laddie. I wanna clock your trouble and strife.

301
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,330

Where's she?

308
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,810
O -- Over to... Her cousin's?

309
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,350
She's just a bit under the weather...

310
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:49,844
(Just ask me...)

311
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,545
Okay, I guess --

312
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,809
Shall we?

00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:54,965
Where to, m'lad?

314
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,855

Sir...

321
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,057
You won't happen to have a nice little comfy room?

322
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,638
I'd rather get some much-needed rest while I wait...

323
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,647
'Course, sir... This way...

324
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,040
Where?

325
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,270
Here...

326
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,819
Lead the way.

327
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:29,751
Come with me...

328
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,380
(What a headache!)

329
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,261
What was that?
-Nothin', sir...

330
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,251
(He better not see Zoya!)

331
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,481
Marlin!

332
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,182
Could you give me some of your aftershave? Badly need some.

333
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,850
Badly what?

334
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,718
Badly need some. No idea why it feels so weird...

335
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:11,998
What is it?

336
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,551
Need some... One!

337
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:17,641
What's the matter with you?

338
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,878
C'mon.

339
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:31,290
Come here, mate!
-What's wrong with you?

340
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,890
What d'you think you're going?
-Gimme a moment to explain, mate! Could you put this on?

341
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,499
C'mon!

342
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,970
That's why I never shave around you!

343
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,060
It's not what you think!

344
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,401
Fair 'nuff. Then why in the blasted world d'you want me to put on your wife's clothes?

345
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:52,071
What the devil's goin' on in that dirty mind of yours?
-Just shut up!

346
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:55,503
I just want you to put this on and see Curtis.

347
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,879
Me -- As your wi --

348
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:00,673
Wife -- Who's Curtis?

349
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,931
You know -- From NBFUK?

350
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,978
NBFUK...

351
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,808
As in the charity?

352
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,759
Aye.

353
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,621
I ask here and you answer over there. Another question and I fear you'd be out on the street!

354
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:23,641
Why's he here to see you, and why do I have to be your wife before him?

355
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,810
Say something, boyo!

356
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,668
Say something, boyo! SAAAYYYY

357
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,963
Say something, boyo! SAAAYYYY SOMMMETHINNNG!

358
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,058
For the last six months, I've been...

359
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,928
Living off the 25 gee allowance they give the blind...

360
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:47,788
WHAT?

361
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,698
WHAT?
♪ <i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i> ♪

AYE!

370
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,341
But why?

371
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,068
Just -- WHY?

372
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,390
I mean -- Why?

373
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,540
It'd been a year since I completed my Masters with a first...

374
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,958
A year of unsuccessful attempts to get a job...

375
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:56,349
A year of stepping out of the house everyday, hoping to get what I'd toiled for all these years... Hoping to get my right...

376
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,129
A year of hoping not to come back disappointed...

377
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,638
A year of losing hope

378
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,998
With each passing day...

379
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,411
A year of having no blasted idea what was going on...

380
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,398
A year of being the most qualified of them all...

381
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:49,459
A year of being the best on the interview...

382
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,598
A year of being crushed under the weight of positive action...

383
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:03,048
A year of being trampled by those with 'recommendations'...

384
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,979
A year of having what I deserved snatched away by blimmin' bribers...

385
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,742
A year in which I realised that all I had was merit...

386
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,959
A knick-knack no one really needed in the modern world...

387
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,399
A year in which I'd begun to loathe myself...

388
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,398
All the more whenever I'd look at Zoya...

389
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,608
Who'd rather starve herself to stand by me

390
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,958
Than complain...

391
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,448
Zoya, who'd taken up arms against her family for me...

392
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,158
Me, who couldn't even provide her three square meals a day...

393
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,668
It was just another day hoppin' between offices

394
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:51,210
When, consumed in fury, self-loathing, and anguish all together...

395
00:29:51,370 --> 00:30:00,930
'NBFUK'
'Monthly allowance for the needful and disabled - 25 thousand Rupees'

396
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,220
Sir...

397
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,433
Could you tell me the address?

398
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,298
I decided...

399
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,851
To end my life...

400
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,111
But my eyes fell on a banner...
'25 thousand Rupees'

401
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,409
I was tired of asking for what was rightfully mine...

402
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:39,357
It was finally time to get my hands on it!

403
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,247
I told Zoya I got a job...

404
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,048
But the truth is, for the last six months...

405
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:08,210
I'd leave for 'work'

406
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:11,588
And spend the day in the park...

407
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,499
I'd give my allowance to Zoya, telling her it's my salary...

408
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,798
Until today, when Curtis came knocking...

409
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,168
Saying he wants to see my wife!

410
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,788
I'm looking my ruin in the eye...

411
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,658
Please, luvvie...

412
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,578
Don't make me tear up...

413
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,338
Kashif?

414
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,518
Don't worry... You're introducing Curtis to your wife...

415
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:49,801
And he won't have a clue! So...

416
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,351
And he won't have a clue! So...

Don't get caught!

00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:22,014
Wait here. I'll tell Curtis you're back.

430
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,538
Here's a tip.

431
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:29,128
Light a cigarette too.

432
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:32,309
You told Curtis your wife smokes?

433
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:35,609
I don't remember telling him my wife sits like that either!

434
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,139
Marlin!

435
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:38,379
Zoya?

436
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,620
Who's -- That?

437
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,159
That --

438
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,020
Well, that's --

439
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,836
I asked you who that is.

440
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,750
Ka -- Kashif, you know?

441
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,530
She's his friend...

442
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,688
I told you, he's upstairs, okay?

443
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,978
How come you're back so early, darling?

444
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:08,230
I saw Ayesha, and guess what?

445
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,338
She told me to start next week.

446
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:12,067
Guess someone's a bludger...

447
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:15,090
You sent me for nothing. Anyway, gotta get some rest...

448
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,155
No way!

449
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,170
You can't go in there.

450
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,176
Why?

451
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:19,974
You know --

452
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,355
I'm having this awful headache, mate...

453
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:24,326
Could you get me a cuppa?

454
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,990
Sure thing. Just lemme change?

455
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,248
Blimey, man!

456
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:31,590
You want to change first? I'll make some myself! Don't bother!
-What's wrong with you?

457
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,318
What's with the anger? Gimme a moment...

458
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:35,586
Fair 'nuff...

459
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,760
Hmph...

460
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,570
I'm gonna barge in and kill ya!

461
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,870
You owe me 534,515.

462
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,351
I'm gonna make Bobby it goes ter someone 'oo deserves it! I'm not scared of ya!

463
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,130
No one, get it?

464
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,591
We clear?

465
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,460
Bog off!

466
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,731
Hmm...

467
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,842
The lady's here, Mr Curt!
-M'lady -- What?

468
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:36,081
How'd she get here? I thought I --

469
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,980
Not your lady... Mine! Come...

470
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,340
Can't you bark calmly?
-Ehh?

471
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,917
Actually -- You don't see it... Keep at it... Keep blabberin'!

472
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,280
Can't stay awake when I'm not chewin' some betel... You almost gave me a heart attack, laddie! Which way?

473
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,538
Here. Come with me.
-Gimme a moment...

474
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,377
This way, sir...

475
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,695
Fate, it seems, had me outdone,

476
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,980
Why are we back where we begun?

477
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,948
Aye, where's she?

478
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,370
Upstairs, sir.

479
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,909
Call her down here.

480
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,759
She'd rather not come here.

481
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,778
Why?

482
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,808
You know...

483
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,410
She stays upstairs today.

484
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,427
Cut the codswallop!

485
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,573
It's nothing, really, sir...

486
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:25,220
Just -- Her 'me time', you know?

487
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,849
She stays in her room one day. I stay the next.

488
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:31,180
That's one way we can say we're happily married without lying through our teeth.

489
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,990
(And they told me the happy part came from being together --) I mean -- When d'you have your 'we time'?

490
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,588
Sundays?

491
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,357
Every Sunday.

492
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,730
Just -- Come with me...

493
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,109
Marlin!

494
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:22,318
Marlin! Open the door!

495
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,050
Marlin!

496
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,258
Marlin!

497
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,870
Jeez...

498
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,612
I'll show you the way...

499
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,360
What's that noise?

500
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,340
It's all black to me, sir... What noise?

501
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,397
Your brain's blacked out too...

502
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:48,428
You hear with your ears, see with your eyes, aye?
-Aye, sir... 'Course...

503
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:51,080
Why do I get a feeling your wife's down here?

504
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,680
No, sir, that's not my wife -- Stay away from her! She's a witch, I tell you!

505
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,010
Don't worry, laddie, I've got one at home too.
-You don't get it, sir!

506
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,520
A real one, sir! That witch comes 'round here sometimes...

507
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,208
And -- I've heard she never spares strangers!

508
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:09,508
Wh -- What now?

509
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:15,581
J -- Just go upstairs sharpish! I'll deal with her! Go! Before it's too late!
-Upstairs? Yeah?

510
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,791
Thank goodness...

511
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,060
Hi...
-Why'd you bolt the door?

512
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,551
No -- I -- Don't think I did?

513
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,761
Who've we got in here except the two of us?

514
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:37,885
How do I know? I can't see, you know...

515
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,005
What?

516
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,616
Just kidding, mate...

517
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:42,956
Tea?

518
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,528
What's with the sunglasses and stick?

519
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,060
That?

520
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,017
Well, just -- Preparing for when I'm blind.

521
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:54,989
What?

522
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:55,968
Aye.

523
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:56,789
Why?

524
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,680
Uhh...

525
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,161
Just -- Getting some practice, you know? Who knows what the future holds?

526
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:05,813
I thought I'd prepare for the worst case scenario... Get it?

527
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,970
What the devil is wrong with you? You all right upstairs?

528
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,370
Aye, never been better...

529
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:19,380
Is it ready? My cuppa? This awful headache's killin' me... Nothing your tea can't cure though! Gimme...

530
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,718
Thank you.

531
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:27,118
Don't you think you should -- You know -- Change now?

532
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,958
Good girl.

533
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,098
I'm losin' it...

534
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,328
Your name, please?

535
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,958
Yes, please.

536
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,937
Blimey, I asked for your name!

537
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:49,778
Kashif...

538
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,068
Ehh?

539
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,617
Zoya Kashif.

540
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,008
Zoya...

541
00:38:58,538 --> 00:38:59,959
Kashif...?

542
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,027
Zoya Kashif...

543
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,527
Zoya <i>Kashif</i>?

544
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:11,970
But... Aren't you married to Marlin? Aye? How d'you explain that?

545
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,967
Very high IQ, I must say!

546
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,767
But, regrettably,

547
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,639
This society

548
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,188
Cannot conceive a woman's identity as distinct from her husband's...

549
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,058
Regrettably,

550
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:36,108
She doesn't have a name she can call her own...

551
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,599
She's always chained in one surname or another...

552
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,969
Why?

553
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,198
Her old man's name before her marriage...

554
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:56,969
And her husband's aft -- Old man's -- Ka -- K -- Kashif's me ol -- Father's name...

555
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,649
When'd he lose his sight?

556
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,074
God bless him...

557
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:08,518
He's 70 but with a perfect 6/6 vision!

558
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,521
I meant your husband!

559
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,071
(I never asked him!)

560
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,200
Aye? I asked something!

561
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,168
Uh -- Well -- Gimme a few options and I'll pick...

562
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,210
We playin' Millionaire 'ere? I'm askin' about your husband, young lady!

563
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,868
What's it matter?

564
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:34,738
Our life's been pitch-black ever since...

565
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,548
Every day moonless,

566
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:41,329
Every night starless...

567
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
Easy...
-No!

568
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,680
You need to get a grip on yourself...
-NO!

569
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,758
Excuse me...

570
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,789
'Keep him busy until I say it's clear down here'

571
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,788
I guess I'll take my leave...

572
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,268
No --

573
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:10,427
You can't leave just yet...

574
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:14,338
I'm done here. Why'd I --
-Curtis...

575
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,358
You're so selfish...

576
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:19,429
You'd slip away sharpish the moment you're done?

577
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,848
I mean --

578
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,509
I ain't gonna let you go... Until you've had some of my finest tea!

579
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,760
No, thanks, that won't be necessary...
-Uhh...

580
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,649
I say it is. Please, take a seat...

581
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,250
Please... Take a seat...

582
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,818
I'll get us both a cuppa.

583
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:42,338
No way, I'm done here. I shouldn't be stayin' here too long...
-CURTIS!

584
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,599
You wanna slip away when you're done?

585
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,000
I won't let you go until you've had a nice cuppa!

586
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,601
No, thank you, I'd rather not --

587
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,262
But I would!

588
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,582
I need some right now.

589
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,731
Please...

590
00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:59,121
I beg you.

591
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,040
Just -- Some water...

592
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,670
And some tea after that. I insist.

593
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,517
Now you sit here like a really good kitten, and I'll be right back!

594
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,257
Meow!

595
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,768
Meow???

596
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,378
Me giddy Aunt that's...!

597
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:25,107
You sent me to Ayesha's office so you could enjoy your little date with her!
-Date?

598
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:28,360
You said she's Kashif's friend when I got back...

599
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,428
And locked me in the kitchen!

00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,327
Why don't you ask Marlin?

639
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,760
Kashif!

640
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,427
That's my dress he's --

641
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,958
Don't worry.

642
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,998
I'll tell you everything.

643
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,798
Zoya! What's wrong with you? Lemme explain!

644
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:47,110
Explain what?

645
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,959
What are you gonna say? What's left for you to say, Marlin?

646
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:53,117
We've been living off charity?

647
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:56,208
There was a time I'd take pride in your uprightness!

648
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:58,558
You've crumpled that image!

649
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,848
I ain't stayin' with you another moment!

650
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:01,969
Please, Zoya!

651
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,129
Please listen to me!

652
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,610
Who is it?

653
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,008
Good day.

654
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,678
Good day, sir.

655
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:23,807
Jiya Effendi.

656
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,978
From the Royal Trust.

657
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,418
I've got some questions for you.

658
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,078
Ah... Aye...

659
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:34,459
I get it...

660
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,561
Come in. Please...

661
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,088
After you.

662
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,788
Please...

663
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,078
You didn't have to come all the way...

664
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:53,088
You could've just asked me to come...

665
00:45:53,178 --> 00:45:56,018
I'd like to see your wife, Mr Marlin.

666
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:58,619
Just want to ask her some questions.

667
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,558
Nothing much... Just a few minutes...

668
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:03,719
A few minutes?

669
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,818
That's all?

670
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:06,178
Of course.

671
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:09,468
Please, take a seat. I'll send her here.

672
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,850
Okay.

673
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,870
Kashif!

674
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,318
Kashif!

675
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:29,908
Okay...

676
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:31,830
Definitely <i>not</i> okay.

677
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:35,889
Do I look okay? I've been starvin' --

678
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:40,363
I almost died just now, and you think it's okay?

679
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,598
Just -- Put on your scarf and come with me.
-I ain't goin' anywhere. It's no use now.

680
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,047
Zoya knows everything!

681
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:51,678
Jiya's here, you know...

682
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:53,435
Who's Jiya?

683
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,188
You know, uh... From the Royal Trust?

684
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:58,938
The Royal <i>what</i>?

685
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:00,999
Another trust?

686
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:09,909
Can I trust you to tell me all the parts of your body you've damaged or lost to win their trust?

687
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,298
Just one last time, mate...

688
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,768
See her so she leaves pronto!

689
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:16,617
No.

690
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:18,327
No blasted way!

691
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:23,857
I ain't helpin' you in any of your scams, like, ever!

692
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,918
Kashif...

693
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,299
Boyo... Aren't we bros?

694
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,628
Doesn't quite look like it to me... No way, we ain't no bros or something. Find someone else.

695
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,969
Wonder who you would be?

696
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,003
We're pals, mate.

697
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:55,669
Just once?

698
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,748
Good day, ma'am.

699
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,395
I'm from the Royal Trust.

700
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,236
This 'help' is a crime!

701
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,826
And I ain't helping you in another crime! No way!

702
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,521
Mr Marlin may have a broken leg, but it is so heartwarming to see he's got your shoulder to lean on...

703
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,658
It's not like I'm enjoyin' it.

704
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:28,467
I've got no choice!

705
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:30,238
But I promise you...

706
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:34,338
Once they're gone, I'm gonna cancel my registration myself!

707
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,997
I promise you.

708
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,108
But please...

709
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,929
Help me out one last time?

710
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,630
Just once?

711
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,862
We've got no shortage of people who'd lie to us...

712
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:55,912
That's why we're asking these questions... We're working to weed out the leeches...

713
00:48:55,912 --> 00:49:00,503
Fine them, and send where they belong - in the nick!

714
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,999
Looks like you don't need me anymore.

715
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,450
Break a leg, tough guy!
-Kashif!

716
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,780
What do I tell you...

717
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,897
Uhh...

718
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:15,950
Mr Marlin! Please, take a seat.

719
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,510
That's Zoya...

720
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,958
My wife.

721
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,478
Yeah, we just met.

722
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:24,692
We've been talking 'bout you, you know.
-Ohh...

723
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:28,798
Excuse me, where's the loo?

724
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:31,179
Over there.

725
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,598
Thank you.

726
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,480
Seems someone forgot to tell me he's got a broken leg too.

727
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,802
Don't worry, I didn't tell her anything.

728
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:46,672
Thank you so much.

729
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,781
'ThANk yOu sO MUcH'! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

730
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,938
Zoya... I can explain...

731
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:56,969
Once Jiya and Curtis are outta here...

732
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,188
If they found out,

733
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:00,798
I'll be thrown in the nick,

734
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,028
Not to mention the fines I'd have to pay!

735
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,158
Y -- You! To the dickens with you!
-Hey!
-I -- Ow!

736
00:50:07,158 --> 00:50:08,767
Oww...

737
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,649
Argh!

738
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,698
Ow!

739
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,442
Kashif!

740
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,053
Kashif! You alright?

741
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:20,173
Kashif?

742
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:21,574
Kashif!

743
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,598
Mum?

744
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,568
Dad? Here --

745
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,839
Zoya! M'girl!

746
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,458
How are you?

747
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,418
Kashif!

748
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:00,489
Get up!

749
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:01,820
What happened, boyo?

750
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,068
Get up!

751
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:04,438
Kashif!

752
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,508
Get up!
-Mrs Munro!

753
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,978
Mrs Zoya Kashif Munro!

754
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:11,869
Been a while since you left to make me a cuppa...

755
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:15,799
Hey! What happened here? How'd she fall down? And why?

756
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:17,799
Don't you see?
-Ehh?

757
00:51:17,835 --> 00:51:20,110
I mean -- I don't, but -- Don't you?
-Aye...

758
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,980
I dunno... She tripped maybe?
-Oh...

759
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,483
Why don't you take her upstairs?

760
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,570
I'll -- Get some hot turmeric --

761
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:31,041
Hot milk with turmeric...

762
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:34,471
Take my hand.
-Hey!
-Take <i>my</i> hand.

763
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:36,165
Okay.

764
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:37,823
Get up, hun.

765
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,578
Careful...

766
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,481
Careful...

767
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,172
Bless you...

768
00:51:43,242 --> 00:51:45,003
Here.

769
00:51:45,043 --> 00:51:47,284
I'll take you upstairs.

770
00:51:47,284 --> 00:51:49,224
Careful, okay?
-Of course!

771
00:51:49,224 --> 00:51:51,573
Be careful, okay?

772
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,710
(What the devil is going on?)

773
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,590
Sorry, it took me a while...

774
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,380
Aye...

775
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,520
No...

776
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,181
It's perfectly okay...

777
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,618
Where's your wife?

778
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,237
Uhh...

779
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:17,607
Well, she --

780
00:52:17,697 --> 00:52:19,380
Why don't you take a seat?

781
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,368
Mum...

782
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:22,919
Dad... Come in...

783
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,756
Mum and Dad...

784
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,598
Uhh...

785
00:52:29,098 --> 00:52:34,369

Would you like to have something? A cuppa? A cold drink, maybe?

802
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,069
God, it kills me... Mum!

803
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,187
What happened?

804
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:14,538
He beat me!

805
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:15,378
Ehh?

806
00:53:15,378 --> 00:53:16,628
That blind bloke?

807
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:18,821
Couldn't he see -- ?

808
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:24,679
How's it any different if her husband's blind, lame, or not...

809
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,981
Wives always get beaten about...

810
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:31,231
Break my heart but not my bones!

811
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:32,891
No way...

812
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:37,330
No way Curtis is forgivin' domestic abuse! I'm gonna fix that blind wretch!

813
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,830
Please, Kurt...

814
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,200
'Curt'?

815
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:43,008
Don't leave me alone in here...

816
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,777
Please, I... OW!

817
00:53:45,777 --> 00:53:48,507
Please... Lie down... Easy...

818
00:53:49,187 --> 00:53:51,889
Ow...

819
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,260
Easy there... It's nothing...

820
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,837
No... I can't take it anymore...

821
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,118
Here?
-Yes, sir.

822
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,061
Here.

823
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:05,201
And here.

824
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,611
(Another?)

825
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:08,541
Here?

826
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:09,622
Aye.

827
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,500
Here.
-Thank you.

828
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,580
Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much!

829
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,784
Hope you're... Satisfied?

830
00:54:17,784 --> 00:54:19,880
Of course. Thank you so much.

831
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,608
Pay attention to this important announcement!

832
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:27,621
Due to rising COVID-19 cases...

833
00:54:27,621 --> 00:54:33,218
16th Street and 17th Street are quarantined!

834
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:39,069
No one is allowed in or out!

835
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:46,932
The Government announces a complete lockdown until everyone in the area is tested!

836
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:51,921
Your cooperation is requested. Thank you.

837
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:57,532
No...

838
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,809
M'love...

839
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:06,490
You're Curtis's life! And Curtis, but the dust under your boots!

840
00:55:06,782 --> 00:55:10,622
I swear, I was just investigating someone when --

841
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:13,582
They quarantined the whole street!

842
00:55:13,662 --> 00:55:15,780
I can't stay here!

843
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,788
Of course you can't!

844
00:55:17,788 --> 00:55:21,360
You need to leave right away. Double time!
-Aye. I'll get going.

845
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,840
Thank you so much. Take care!
-Aye. Take care!

846
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,094
Don't forget to close the door!
-Sure.

847
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,070
Thank goodness...

848
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,048
Good half-riddance.

849
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,868
Told you not to force me to go to Karachi.

850
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:45,008
If I died of COVID-19 in here, you're responsible for it!

851
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,058
What are you saying?

852
00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:50,893
Life and death are in the Lord's hands, and His hands alone.

853
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,761
Besides...

854
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:55,561
The virus is spreading all over the country...

855
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,271
Mum...

856
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:02,652
Please, relax... Both of you!

857
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,611
Everything's gonna be alright.

858
00:56:07,294 --> 00:56:09,514
Hammer some sense into your Dad.

859
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,088
Thank goodness Jiya's gone.

860
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:18,349
Where's Zoya?

861
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:19,939
In her room.

862
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:22,518
Her Mum and Dad are here.

863
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,790
Wha -- Here?

864
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,650
That just means --
-Aye?

865
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,321
Aye?
-Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.

866
00:56:28,321 --> 00:56:30,860
Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.

867
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,914
You gonna curse your mate like that?

868
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,737
Aye aye, Your Highness.

869
00:56:46,838 --> 00:56:51,138
Don't worry. Your man's gonna update you every hour.

870
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:54,598
I won't let you or your faith in me down.

871
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,749
Of course!

872
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:58,638
Take care, hun.

873
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,168
Gordon Bennett!

874
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,622
You're lucky

875
00:57:08,622 --> 00:57:10,723
That Mum and Dad got here.

876
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,718
I can't tell them about the real you because I don't want to embarrass myself!

877
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:23,920
I chose <i>you</i> over them.

878
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,939
And <i>you</i>!

879
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,898
Honestly, Zoya?

880
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:35,518
You got a point there.

881
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,428
Can it.

882
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:43,692
And could you please take my gown off, clean it, and give it back?

883
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:49,913
I -- I'd give it back right away -- But -- Curtis is upstairs and -- I haven't got a replacement, so...

884
00:57:49,913 --> 00:57:50,704
Aye.

885
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:51,539
She's right...
-Wha -- ?

886
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,964
Wha -- ?
-I mean -- He's right...

887
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:54,478
I mean -- He's right...
-Better.

888
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,208
Sorry...

889
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,828
Not so fast!

890
00:58:19,938 --> 00:58:23,528
Where are you off to?
-Don't you know these streets have been locked down?

891
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,314
Please let me go...

892
00:58:25,314 --> 00:58:27,452
I was just here for an inquiry...

893
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:30,170
I've got my mask on! Lemme go back --

894
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:34,188
Sorry, ma'am. Orders from the top. No one goes in or out.

895
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:35,768
Go back.

896
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,028
That --

897
00:58:37,028 --> 00:58:38,768
Isn't my place!

898
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:42,019
Mum's gonna be so worried if I didn't go back!

899
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:48,958
Please lemme go...
-I hope you know that if, God forbid, you got infected, you're gonna take the virus straight to her doorstep!

900
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,848
No way we're riskin' it, ma'am.

901
00:58:54,677 --> 00:58:56,288
What d'you think you're doing?
-What d'you think you're doing?

902
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,988
Tryin' to bribe a cop?

903
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,928
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

904
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:03,888
Why? Don't you folks normally take it?

905
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,888
Not really.

906
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:08,070
Not this time, at least.
-Aye.

907
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,423
Go back.
-Aye, back where you came from.

908
00:59:10,498 --> 00:59:12,558
Please let me go, sir...

909
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:15,118
I was just doing my duty.

910
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,878
Just here to inquire...

911
00:59:16,878 --> 00:59:19,350
Last warning! Go back where you came from!
-Can't you hear me? Go back right now!

912
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,380
But -- Mum's all alone...

913
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,147
It's best for you to go back.
-Right now!

914
00:59:25,248 --> 00:59:27,710
Back!
-You hear me? BACK!

915
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,149
Aye...
-RIGHT NOW!

916
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,575
Get a move on!

917
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:47,061
That's how your sweet son-in-law honours us!

918
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:51,668
Half an hour since we got here, and he hasn't even bothered to greet us!

919
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:52,848
Big deal.

920
00:59:52,848 --> 00:59:57,750
That's how <i>you</i> honoured your son-in-law. For an <i>entire year</i>!

921
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:02,077
Please, Mr Siddiqui... Don't expect respect when you didn't give any.

922
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:05,728
What? You want me to fall at his feet?

923
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:08,318
I came here because you told me to.

924
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,928
And now that you're here, why don't you be a bit more generous?

925
01:00:11,998 --> 01:00:15,678
Perhaps even say sorry for how you treated him?

926
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,227
What?

927
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,723
Say sorry? Like, for real?

928
01:00:20,132 --> 01:00:21,543
No way.

929
01:00:21,593 --> 01:00:22,773
Fair 'nuff.

930
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:25,573
Feel free to book a ticket back home.

931
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,528
Blimey, are you blackmailing me?

932
01:00:28,528 --> 01:00:30,358
I might be.

933
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:33,261
You blackmailed me for an entire year.

934
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:36,152
I've missed my girl for an entire year.

935
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,230
I ain't begging for his forgiveness or something.

936
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:44,368
Who asked you to beg forgiveness?

937
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:49,913
Just pull him into a warm embrace... Burn the cold bitterness with the warmth!

938
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,838
Hmm?

939
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,408
Mrs Marlin!

940
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,318
Mrs Marlin!

941
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,291
Mrs Marlin!

942
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,862
Just a sec!

943
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,480
Zoya!

944
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,678
Zoya!

945
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,609
Just a sec, Dad!

946
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:31,488
Guess no one needs me...

947
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,428
Good Lord...

948
01:01:39,578 --> 01:01:41,620
You heard me in a moment!

949
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,492
Guess I should've asked for something else...

950
01:01:45,407 --> 01:01:47,128
Alright, Marlin...

951
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,987
Don't stop me now, Zoya!

952
01:01:49,987 --> 01:01:54,107
How dare that blind bugger touch you? I'll never forgive him!
-B -- But --

953
01:01:54,107 --> 01:01:56,317
I already forgave him...

954
01:01:56,317 --> 01:02:02,257
When the most courteous forgive someone, the others should follow suit too.

955
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,721
Why'd <i>you</i> say sorry to <i>him</i>? No way!

956
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,228
Just... For your happiness...

957
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:23,379
And to put everything that's happened behind us...

958
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:32,958
Zoya!

959
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:46,630
Can't you see he's got a broken leg?
-The name's Curtis! Top tyke in town! That's his wife there, ask her!

960
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:50,289
But -- His wife's right here! Zoya!
-Ehh?

961
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:54,470
What's your problem with me, you Chinese knockoff Judi Dench?

962

965
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,289
(Who is it this time?)

966
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,289
You?

967
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,201
What happened?

968
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,518
The cops won't let me go!

969
01:03:11,518 --> 01:03:13,338
I literally begged them!

970
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:16,161
But they're like, 'No one goes in or out'!

971
01:03:17,081 --> 01:03:20,063
It's okay, easy there... Come in...

972
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,714
How will I go back?

973
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,084
I'm sure we can work something out.

974
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,811
Make yourself at home here. Don't leave this room. What if -- I'm infected and you caught COVID-19 from me?

975
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:31,265
Please...

976
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,718
Prevention...

977
01:03:36,114 --> 01:03:37,758
Is always better...

978
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:39,227
Than cure!

979
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,870
Hmph!

980
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,338
Calm down, ma'am... Please... Get a grip on yourself!

981
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,481
You know the virus is spreading so fast!

982
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:54,062
Who knows...

983
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:57,521
One of us... Me... Or my wife... May be infected!

984
01:03:57,771 --> 01:03:59,041
Aye.

985
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:00,282
So...

986
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:01,860
Here's a tip...
-Aye?

987
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,678
Aye?
-Don't leave this room.

988
01:04:03,678 --> 01:04:06,647
Okay? I don't want anything happening to you.

989
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:08,322
Get it?

990
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,827
No leavin' this room.

991
01:04:10,827 --> 01:04:12,897
Very good. I -- I'll be back...

992
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:15,068
Just a moment, okay?

993
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:26,229
I realise I've been so wrong about Marlin all this time...

994
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:31,310
I just want to embrace him, and in that warmth, put all this coldness behind us...

995
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,973
No way!

996
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,588
No way you're embracing him or something!

997
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,348
But why?

998
01:04:43,398 --> 01:04:44,778
Because --

999
01:04:46,644 --> 01:04:49,324
Social distancing, you know?

1000
01:04:49,324 --> 01:04:52,880
You heard the announcement, didn't you? It's spreading!

1001
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,708
You're staying a good 2 metres from him!

1002
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:03,133
And... It's best if you stay in here... Don't leave this room, okay?

1003
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,774
Okay...

1004
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:08,668
Fair enough...

1005
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,502
The cops sent Jiya back. She's in the drawing room.

1006
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:19,178
Dad wants to give you a warm hug and put all the coldness behind.

1007
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:25,958
And Curtis wants to make you pay for every bit of cruelty you've subjected me to.

1008
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:43,782
Why are you crying?

1009
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:46,874
It ain't gonna take you home or something.

1010
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:49,398
Just missing me Mum...

1011
01:06:49,398 --> 01:06:51,769
I've never been away from her this long.

1012
01:06:51,769 --> 01:06:55,550
I can't sleep without her...

1013
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,768
Why? Does she sing you a nice little lullaby every night?

1014
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:08,950
Whoa... How'd you -- Read my mind? You're so nice...
-Please -- Social distancing, you know?

1015
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,800
Could you sing a lullaby for me?

1016
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,987
What?

1017
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,008
Or --

1018
01:07:18,008 --> 01:07:21,493
I'll be up all night... Please?

1019
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,738
Mum...

1020
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,151
I really wanted to embrace you...

1021
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,159
But I guess... Cruel fate stops me...

1022
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:40,099
It'd be a choking embrace if you knew a thing about cruel fate...

1023
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:44,829
I'm impressed by your honesty, uprightness, and self-respect.

1024
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:48,811
(Don't worry...)

1025
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,240
(You ain't gonna be for too long.)

1026
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:53,260
What?

1027
01:07:53,331 --> 01:07:54,431
Uhh...

1028
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,552
No -- I mean...

1029
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,242
Never forget that!

1030
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,661
Just...

1031
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:02,172
One thing I'd ask of you.

1032
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:03,278
Aye?

1033
01:08:03,407 --> 01:08:05,987
Don't keep anything to yourself.

1034
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,448
You've always got us, m'boy.

1035
01:08:10,448 --> 01:08:13,118
You're more our son than son-in-law.

1036
01:08:14,808 --> 01:08:19,419
Of course. Just what I wanted to say... Before I lost my words back there.

1037
01:08:19,498 --> 01:08:22,348
(Guess we're both losing something today...)

1038
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,848
What?

1039
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:28,338
I mean -- It's such a blessed day!

1040
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:31,468
I've found Mum and Dad again... In you...

1041
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:33,729
Bless you.

1042
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:37,680
I'm sure you need some rest.

1043
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,710
Lemme know if you need anything.

1044
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,831
'Course.
-Bless you with a long and happy life, love.

1045
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,721
Zoya...

1046
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:48,998
Please...

1047
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:55,869
I have no explanation that can satisfy you...

1048
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,858
Nor the courage to beg forgiveness...

1049
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:03,178
So... Punish me any way you like...

1050
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,368
You've got a <i>long</i> list of people to beg forgiveness of.

1051
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,147
If they all forgive you, I'll tell you my decision.

Wanna see how you brutalise your English hoe -- English rose?

What's the matter? Calm down!

1065

How dare you leave her foor, prail self to sleep on the floor outside the room?

1066
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,298
She -- what?

1067
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:11,220
Guess I didn't see her... I can't see, you see...

1068
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,108
'Can't see'? I thought you had a broken leg!

1069
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:15,129
Uh...

1070
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:16,188
Aye...

1071
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:17,363
Aye...

1072
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:19,983
Hey! Who's askin'?

1073
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:23,144
Can't you see he's blind?

1074
01:12:23,144 --> 01:12:26,040
Forget about me. Who in the world are you?

1075
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,990
I think you're the blind one here! Can't you see he's got a limp?

1076
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:38,430
Can't you see he's got a broken leg?
-The name's Curtis! Top tyke in town! That's his wife there, ask her!

1077
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:41,150
B -- But -- His wife's right here! Zoya!

1078
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,171
Ehh?

1079
01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:45,836
What's your problem with me, you Chinese knockoff Judi Dench?

1080
01:12:45,836 --> 01:12:51,007
First, you tell me he's not blind. Then, you tell me this is not his wife... What the devil is wrong with you?

1081
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:55,329
There's lies, damned lies, and everything you said! I'm just shuttin' your cod up!

1082
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,187
He's lame and she's his wife!

1083
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:02,218
No ma'am, he's blind and <i>she</i>'s his wife!

1084
01:13:02,218 --> 01:13:07,390
He's lame and she's his wife!
-He's blind and she's his wife!

1085
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:09,460
ENOUGH!

1086
01:13:13,388 --> 01:13:15,168
I'm not blind...

1087
01:13:15,788 --> 01:13:17,528
Or lame...

1088
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,478
I'm just another liar...

1089
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:26,022
And... I'm not his wife...

1090
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:30,208
I'm his friend, Kashif...
-Blimey...

1091
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:34,753
What the dickens is going on, Zoya?

1092
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,880
So, you flimflammer...

1093
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,391
You've been living off our allowance for the last six months, pretending to be blind?

1094
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:49,252
Not just yours, he's been living off our allowance for the lame for the last six months too!

1095
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:55,052
You lowlife cheat! You've been living off charity? What'd my daughter do to deserve this?

1096
01:13:55,052 --> 01:13:57,503
Can't believe I was awed by your uprightness!

1097
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,968
Mhm!

1098
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:01,293
After I'm through with you...

1099
01:14:01,443 --> 01:14:04,540
Generations to come will remember what you --

1100
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,600
Shut your blimmin' gob!

1101
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:09,960
Your name's Curtis...

1102
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,071
But all I see is the most discourteous man I've ever met!

1103
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,960
I'm the top tyke in town!
-Can it!

1104
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,038
What d'you want?

1105
01:14:18,148 --> 01:14:20,317
Want to send me to the nick?

1106
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:22,728
C'mon, call the cops. Arrest me.

1107
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,347
That's the blasted limit!

1108
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,849
I've done my Masters!

1109
01:14:36,128 --> 01:14:40,238
With a first... Straight As all the way...

1110
01:14:41,368 --> 01:14:44,118
But... Medals, grades, certificates... I might as well burn 'em all...

1111
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:46,883
Because I find they're useless to me...

1112
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,929
There's no place in the city I haven't applied to...

1113
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,153
But you know what they're looking for?

1114
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:57,698
A sweetener.

1115
01:14:58,150 --> 01:15:00,460
A 'recommendation' from the toffs...

1116
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:04,878
I've got neither...

1117
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,320
No one - including me - loves to live off charity.

1118
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:14,351
But the status quo, the system...

1119
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:17,241
Forces a wise and capable man...

1120
01:15:17,241 --> 01:15:20,570
To use his wisdom in all the wrong ways...

1121
01:15:21,691 --> 01:15:23,230
Hunger...

1122
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:26,020
Numbs the mind... The conscience...

1123
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,010
Until...

1124
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:30,520
It doesn't feel wrong at all...

1125
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:34,870
I could bear the hunger...

1126
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,058
As long as it was just my own...

1127
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:45,522
But someone else depended on me...

1128
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,038
She had everything in life, every luxury...

1129
01:15:51,038 --> 01:15:53,978
She chose me over it all...

1130
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:58,328
Because she believed in me...

1131
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,438
She was the only one who saw my potential...

1132
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:07,087
Don't think...

1133
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,871
I don't have any regret...

1134
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:13,642
I deserve to be punished for all I did...

1135
01:16:14,171 --> 01:16:16,402
So please... Arrest me...

1136
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,495
Sell this house...

1137
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:24,949
And take back every penny I took from your charities...

1138
01:16:25,049 --> 01:16:29,019
Consider whatever's left my donation to you...

1139
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,128
Because it's never gonna be home again...

1140
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:45,538
Aye, looks like a zoo to me. You done yet?

1141
01:16:45,538 --> 01:16:48,229
Lovely speech... Give him a huge hand, will ya?

1142
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,970
That was bang-on brilliant, me lad...

1143
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:54,250
Lemme tell ya wot 'appened. Ya thought ya could brin' Curtis ter tears.

1144
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:58,070
But Curtis 'as got a heart of stone! Get it? Stone!

1145
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,630
Lemme call 999. Get sum cavalry in...

1146
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,653
Lemme call 999. Get sum cavalry in...
-Wait.

1147
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,118
Not so fast.

1148
01:17:07,473 --> 01:17:12,674
I'll pay back every penny he's taken from your charities.

1149
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,511
Too late, guv. Ya daan't kna me.

1150
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:19,501
They say I'm loike Sylvester Stallone... Quite accurately, I say.

1151
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:23,061
'E drew first blood, and I'm gonna give 'im a bloody end 'e won't believe!

1152
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:29,731
... And I'm donating 1.5 million to each of your charities. How's that sound?

1153
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:34,030
Ya didn't 'ear the whole fin', Uncle...

1154
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:38,510
But I believe... Blood for blood's gonna bleed the whole world ter deaf...

1155
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:42,321
Wise words... Wise words indeed!
-'Course...

1156
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:46,728
You don't need to do this.

1157
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,168
I do, my dear.

1158
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,378
Because, in a way,

1159
01:17:53,378 --> 01:17:56,578
I'm guilty of what's happened too...

1160
01:17:57,528 --> 01:18:02,308
If I had the same faith in you as Zoya... If I could give you a chance...

1161
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:05,198
None of this would've happened...

1162
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:07,778
I'm sorry...

1163
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,018
I've apologised to everyone.

1164
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:38,918
What's your decision?

1165
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:43,551
I can forgive everything...

1166
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:46,258
Except...

1167
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:48,928
<i>One</i> cardinal sin...

1168
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:56,791
If the tailor ruining my favourite dress weren't enough, you gave it to Kashif who absolutely <i>devastated</i> it!

1169
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:02,911
Way to go, Zoya! He devastated my gender identity, but all you care about is your dress!

1170
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:07,332
Not to mention this dreadful armache thanks to the flowerpot you threw --

1171
01:19:07,332 --> 01:19:08,892
Actually... Never mind...

1172
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:10,186
Sir...

1173
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,138
Uhh...

1174
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:19,029
By the way, Uncle... Marlin owes me a small amount too... Just about 20 gee or so... It's no big deal, really...

1175
01:19:19,029 --> 01:19:23,400
But I thought we could <i>all</i> have a happy little ending if I got a little cheque too...

1176
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,680
'Happy little ending'!

1177
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,999
Now you're suckin' diesel!

1178
01:19:25,999 --> 01:19:28,519
Alright, you'll get it back.

1179
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:30,900
Kashif!

1180
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:34,000
(Sorry!)
