1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,455
Lemme work at Ayesha's firm. She's paying so well!

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,917
And I stay home? No way.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,595
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... I'm comin' over to your place tomorrow!

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:13,438
You're introducing Curtis to your wife... And he won't have a clue!

5
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:19,700
The name's Curtis. Top tyke in town! I know a rotter when I see one!

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,239
Your name, please?

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,119
Yes, please.

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,850
I asked you who that is.
-Ka -- Kashif's friend...

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,470
Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.
-Yeah?

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,421
Why do I get a feeling your wife's down here?

11
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,722
Stay away from her! She's a witch, I tell you!

12
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,542
Don't worry, laddie, I've got one at home too.

13
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,723
Aren't we bros?
-Doesn't quite look like it...

14
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:42,570
He's lame and that's his wife!
-He's blind and that's his wife!

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,900
To the dickens with you!
-Hey!
-I -- Ow!

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,410
Wives always get beaten about... Break my heart but not my bones!

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,417
'Blind Love'

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,338
Good morning!

19
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,398
'Morning...

20
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,839
Your breakfast, Madame.

21
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,290
I would've made something for myself -- Why'd you -- ?

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,693
You do everything six days a week. You deserve a day off.

23
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:36,358
You go to work six days a week too. Take care of my needs... Comforts... You deserve a day off too.

24
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,634
Hold on...

25
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,838
Comforts? Here?

26
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,024
Please, Zoya... You left your comforts behind...

27
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:53,119
I mean... The daughter of the owner of Siddiqui and Co., choosing to marry a middle-class man like myself... Angering her father... Leaving her luxuries behind...

28
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,971
Love demands sacrifices, Mr Marlin Munro.

29
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,419
So, no regrets.

30
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:02,859
Thank you.

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,693
Breakfast? It's getting cold!

32
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,437
Thank you.

33
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,945
And aye... How 'bout going out for lunch?

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,206
No way you're wasting another penny!

35
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,810
Using the AC's cost us so much already.

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,216
For God's sake, Zoya... These words don't suit you.

37
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,870
(They suit me.) For now, though, I've got the money!

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,649
Just save it for later!

39
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:33,444
Besides, all the diners are closed. Thanks to the Coronavirus.

40
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:38,914
Guess what, I've got this friend who knows the right palms to grease. We're going to his diner!

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,085
You gonna finish your breakfast or want me to...?

42
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,113
Kashif!

43
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,372
Kashif!

44
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,642
Get up! C'mon!

45
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,878
2 Gee. I want it right now.

46
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,852
Where's your gun?

47
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,099
Gun?

48
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,604
I thought all the robbers carried one.

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,170
No -- It's just -- Zoya wants to go out for lunch... And I haven't got my salary yet...

50
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,888
Make her a nice big omelette for now and be done with it. Simple.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,048
A nice big omelette, eh?

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,330
Seriously, Kashif? You've been staying here for weeks. Have I asked you for a penny? Like, ever?

53
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,560
The same old line you say at least ten times a month to rob me of 2 gee every time, which you never return!

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,320
Well --
-Would've been better if I paid you a rent instead!

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,926
Forget the rent... Just 2 gee? Your mate's honour's on the line!

56
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,678
Yeah?

57
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:10,270
Maybe next time you'd want to check your wallet before taking her out for lunch...
-Could you just check yours for now?

58
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,711
It's all I've got for now --

59
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,492
It's all I've got for now --
-Aye...

60
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,653
Aye... It'll do!

61
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,053
Marlin!

62
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,299
A 'thank you' couldn't hurt all that much, could it?

63
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,926
Not now!

64
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,082
Marlin!

65
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,920
<i>I gotta thank you?</i>

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,820
Osman's wounded her...

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,230
She's broken... Completely...

68
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,060
Why don't you rid yourself of this burden?

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,641
Mum says once a girl's married --

70
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,279
Jesus...

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,660
It's been a year since Zoya's marriage... Marlin would've demanded money if he was after it!

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,138
You don't know how patient these middle-class folks can be...

73
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:13,120
The day the lights go out of my eyes... Everything that's mine... Will be his...

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,068
I don't know it? Seriously?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:31,418
In case you've forgotten, Mr Siddiqui... Before hitting the jackpot, you were no more than a middle-class folk yourself...

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,301
Don't tell me you haven't mixed some water in your shampoo to squeeze every last drop out of it!

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,850
Hey! Keep your voice down!

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,651
Big deal!

79
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,871
You shouldn't forget your past like that...

80
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:56,849
You shouldn't forget how hard I've worked all these years... It ain't just about a jackpot or something!

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,479
Big deal, Mr Siddiqui!

82
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,369
You won the money but lost your daughter's love.

83
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,489
Fathers sacrifice everything for their daughters.

84
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay...

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,811
I'll forget everything if Zoya leaves that Marlin bloke...

86
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,670
Blimey, he's her husband!

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,170
Not to me!
-Okay...

88
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,807
Guess I gotta sort a few things out too...

89
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,281
I want no complaints.

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,691
Hey!

91
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,481
Not cricket!

92
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,722
That will be all...

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,448
Blimey...

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,658
After you!

95
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,478
Told you no one's gonna be around!

96
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,898
Aye, but I would've liked it better at home... But you wanted to go out for lunch...

97
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:11,919
No, Zoya... I really want to see you happy... Don't spoil my mood now...

98
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,450
You really want to see me happy, right?

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,778
Yes!

100
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,381
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

101
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,912
Shh!

102
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,227
We've talked about it and you know my decision.

103
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:32,162
What's your problem?
-Zoya...

104
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,157
It's about my self-respect!

105
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,959
Like, d'you expect me to stay home? No way!

106
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,249
Guess what your Dad's gonna say? 'He'S LiViNG oFf HiS WiFe'. No way I'm gonna take it quietly!

107
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,529
Your phone's ringing.

108
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,011
Who is it?
-Uhh...

109
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,480
My boss... I'll be right back!

110
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,058
Hello?
-Aye...

111
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:42,288
Martin Munro? Sorry -- Marlin Munro...

112
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,061
Aye...

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,386
It's...

114
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,056
Curtis from NBFUK...

115
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,238
Good day, sir...

116
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,948
You're the Bacon Rind Heap Of Coke, in'cha?

117
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,709
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

118
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,200
You've been...

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,090
You've been... Most kind,

120
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,540
You've been... Most kind, sir...

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,608
I'm comin' over tomorra!

122
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,198
Sir?

123
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,728
Why?

124
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,108
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

125
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:35,088
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

126
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,458
Okay...

127
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,721
When are you coming?

128
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,800
Loike I need an appointment!

129
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll drop by chicken pen I wanna!

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,951
See you!

131
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:50,642
Okay...

132
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,193
Bye...

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,370
WhEN aRe yOU CoMiNg?

134
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,111
Get me sum Ten Furlongs!

135
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,499
Wow...

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,808
What is it?

137
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,350
Nothing... Why?

138
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,501
You look worried... Since your boss called, you know?

139
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,081
Do I?

140
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,500
No?

141
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,581
It's nothing, really...

142
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,661
I was just thinking...

143
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah?

144
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,860
How...

145
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,118
Backward I am!

146
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:11,469
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

147
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:17,199
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

148
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,780
Yeah?
-Hmm...

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,602
Your friend who runs that firm --
-Ayesha.

150
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,253
Ayesha.
-Aye, Ayesha!

151
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:33,090
Why don't you call her? You can start tomorrow. Fine by me.

152
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,361
What happened so suddenly?

153
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,070
Nothing... I just really want to see you happy, Zoya. And you're happy, right?

154
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,460
Of course.
-So am I.

155
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,108
Enjoy!

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,968
Tried this?

157
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,978
What's up?

158
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,249
What I should've done long ago...

159
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,799
What?

160
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm going...

161
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,250
To Karachi...

162
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,517
To my daughter's...

163
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,650
I can't live away from her anymore.

164
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,458
You'd go against me?

165
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,220
No... Only against your bull-headedness.

166
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,230
I got a ticket for you too...

167
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,851
In case you have second thoughts tonight...

168
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,919
And yeah...

169
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,830
If you didn't come with me, don't expect me to come back.

170
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,690
You can live the life you want in this palace, all by yourself...

171
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:24,168
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

172
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,671
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

173
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,610
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

174
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,769
Shh!

175
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,430
I was just thinking...

176
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,959
Yeah?

177
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,940
How...

178
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,870
Backward I am!

179
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:52,138
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

180
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,568
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

181
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm comin' over tomorra!

182
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,347
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

183
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,320
This one'd fit three of me! What were you high on?
-No way?

184
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,948
What?

185
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,141
Someone else's size?

186
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,990
No way... No woman can be this big!

187
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,970
I've spent five months' savings on it!

188
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:43,411
No way I'm getting another. You're gonna fix this one.

189
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,611
Who could be this big?

190
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,598
Zoya!

191
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:30,008
Zoya!

192
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,129
C'mon, mate! Get up! Get ready!

193
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,829
C'mon!
-What is it?

194
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,279
Don't you have to go to work?

195
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,018
I'm starting next week...

196
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:47,030
What? Next week?

197
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:54,258
<i>What's wrong with you? Stop shouting!
-What's wrong with you? You've got this job and you're putting it off!</i>

198
00:16:54,258 --> 00:17:00,078
Do you have any idea how many people struggle to get a decent job?

199
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,188
Never thought you'd be so thankless!

200
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,918
Actually, no... My bad...

201
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:11,588
You're used to having servants!

202
00:17:11,588 --> 00:17:16,901
How can you handle the pressures of a 9-to-5 job, a boss, and yeah, office politics?

203
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:19,850
This ain't for you, mate?

204
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,868
Seriously? That what you think?

205
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:25,429
You're forcing me...

206
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,108
Well then, I'm about to prove you wrong!

207
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:31,328
Really?

208
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,390
Aye!
-Get ready then! Double time!

209
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,318
Make me proud!

210
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,538
Thank goodness...

211
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,368
Zoya!

212
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:57,408
Zoya!

213
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:58,550
Zoya!

214
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,969
What now?

215
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,749
Sanitiser...

216
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,348
Mask...

217
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,139
And...

218
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,178
Good luck...

219
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,948
Bye!

220
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,091
Alright, Marlin...

221
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,341
Time to put up your best act!

222
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,810
<i>I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

223
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,830
<i>Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

224
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,889
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

225
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:37,010
<i>And pushed me to extremes!</i>

226
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,030
<i>I got in a bit of a tizzy,</i>

227
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,040
<i>Fate made me a bit dizzy...</i>

228
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,031
<i>Until it blew my mind!</i>

229
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:47,800
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

230
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
<i>Just a second!
That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

231
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,700
<i>Just a second!
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

232
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,850
<i>This blind man's gonna need a moment!
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

233
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,770
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

234
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:08,030
Nah way you're gettin' away! I'll expose ya for the world ter clock! You're busted for real this nickle and dime!

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,948

The name's Curtis. Top tyke in town! I know a rotter when I see one!

Marilyn Monroe? No -- Whatsit...

251
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,148
Marlin Munro.
-Aye, that...

252
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,256
Shall we?

253
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,377
So...

254
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:11,878
Where to?

255
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:14,590
Come with me... Over here...

256
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,990
This way.

257
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,589
Grab a pew...

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,550
Wanna have a cold drink?

259
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,930
You're introducing Curtis to your wife...

260
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,248
And he won't have a clue!

261
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,597
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

262
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:32,730
<i>'Blind Love'
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

263
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,151
'Blind Love'

264
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,298
Please, come in, sir.

265
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,081
This way.

266
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,978
Wanna have something?

267
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,598
A cold cuppa... Or hot water?

268
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:47,098
Cold cuppa? That sounds awfully cold!

269
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,591
Your place looks fine.

270
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,581
Aye, sir...

271
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:54,530
Thanks to me Mum and Dad who left me this place.

272
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,421
Or a blind man like me

273
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,985
Wouldn't have a roof over his head.

274
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,939
Too bad I can't live on the curtains... The windows, the doors here...

275
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,698
Did -- Did you drop something?

276
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,188
Nah, nothin'...

277
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,618
Roof over yer 'ead, eh?

278
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,440
Hardly the first time I've heard that one, kid.

279
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,578
This emotional blackmail ain't gonna Kathy Burke on me.

280
00:21:23,678 --> 00:21:26,628
So, I meant to say...

281
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,277
Sir?

282
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,028
Why don't you sell this place,

283
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,221
Get an apartment

284
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:36,968
And invest whatever's left?

285
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:39,538
Better than living off charity, innit?

286
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,307
This place

287
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,790
Is my last hope...

288
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,368
You know

289
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:50,028
My type have got no one in the world.

290
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:51,018
Besides --

291
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,719
The times, they're rotten!

292
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:55,528
What if I bumped into a fraud?

293
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,614
I'd have nowhere left to go.

294
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,927
Nowhere left ter go, aye.

295
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,678
If you're done with the questions, could I hear the good news?

296
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:13,080
News that your charity's gonna gi -- I mean... Support me?

297
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,761
We ain't done yet, laddie. I wanna clock your trouble and strife.

298
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,158
Sir?

299
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,578
Hmm?

300
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,300
B -- Bu -- But why?

301
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,330
What d'you mean why? Just wanna ask some questions.

302
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,118
Sh -- She ain't here...

303
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,197
What?

304
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:34,368
Thought ya wrote you're cash and carried! Didn't ya?

305
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:36,070
Aye -- I -- Am, aye...

306
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,678
B -- But... She ain't here right now...

307
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,548
Where's she?

308
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,810
O -- Over to... Her cousin's?

309
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,350
She's just a bit under the weather...

310
00:22:48,804 --> 00:22:49,844
(Just ask me...)

311
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:51,545
Okay, I guess --

312
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,809
Shall we?

313
00:22:53,265 --> 00:22:54,965
Where to, m'lad?

314
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,855
I'd like to wait a while.

315
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:58,785
'Course -- Not --

316
00:22:58,785 --> 00:23:00,316
Not?

317
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:01,636
Young man,

318
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:07,286
I'm not used ter repeatin' myself. I said I'm not leavin' before I've seen 'er!

319
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,658
Yes --

320
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:10,758
Sir...

321
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,057
You won't happen to have a nice little comfy room?

322
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:19,638
I'd rather get some much-needed rest while I wait...

323
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,647
'Course, sir... This way...

324
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,040
Where?

325
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,270
Here...

326
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,819
Lead the way.

327
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:29,751
Come with me...

328
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,380
(What a headache!)

329
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,261
What was that?
-Nothin', sir...

330
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:39,251
(He better not see Zoya!)

331
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,481
Marlin!

332
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,182
Could you give me some of your aftershave? Badly need some.

333
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,850
Badly what?

334
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,718
Badly need some. No idea why it feels so weird...

335
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:11,998
What is it?

336
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,551
Need some... One!

337
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:17,641
What's the matter with you?

338
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,878
C'mon.

339
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:31,290
Come here, mate!
-What's wrong with you?

340
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,890
What d'you think you're going?
-Gimme a moment to explain, mate! Could you put this on?

341
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,499
C'mon!

342
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,970
That's why I never shave around you!

343
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,060
It's not what you think!

344
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,401
Fair 'nuff. Then why in the blasted world d'you want me to put on your wife's clothes?

345
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:52,071
What the devil's goin' on in that dirty mind of yours?
-Just shut up!

346
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:55,503
I just want you to put this on and see Curtis.

347
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,879
Me -- As your wi --

348
00:24:58,124 --> 00:25:00,673
Wife -- Who's Curtis?

349
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,931
You know -- From NBFUK?

350
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,978
NBFUK...

351
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,808
As in the charity?

352
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,759
Aye.

353
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:18,621
I ask here and you answer over there. Another question and I fear you'd be out on the street!

354
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:23,641
Why's he here to see you, and why do I have to be your wife before him?

355
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,810
Say something, boyo!

356
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,668
Say something, boyo! SAAAYYYY

357
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,963
Say something, boyo! SAAAYYYY SOMMMETHINNNG!

358
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,058
For the last six months, I've been...

359
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,928
Living off the 25 gee allowance they give the blind...

360
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:47,788
WHAT?

361
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:48,698
<i>WHAT?
That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

362
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:50,010
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

363
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,350
<i>Aye.
That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

364
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,460
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

365
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,188
<i>You...
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

366
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,700
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

367
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,758
<i>Livin' off charity?
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

368
00:25:58,758 --> 00:25:59,738
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

369
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,239
AYE!

370
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,341
But why?

371
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,068
Just -- WHY?

372
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,390
I mean -- Why?

373
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,540
It'd been a year since I completed my Masters with a first...

374
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,958
A year of unsuccessful attempts to get a job...

375
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:56,349
A year of stepping out of the house everyday, hoping to get what I'd toiled for all these years... Hoping to get my right...

376
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,129
A year of hoping not to come back disappointed...

377
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,638
A year of losing hope

378
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,998
With each passing day...

379
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,411
A year of having no blasted idea what was going on...

380
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,398
A year of being the most qualified of them all...

381
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:49,459
A year of being the best on the interview...

382
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,598
A year of being crushed under the weight of positive action...

383
00:27:59,088 --> 00:28:03,048
A year of being trampled by those with 'recommendations'...

384
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,979
A year of having what I deserved snatched away by blimmin' bribers...

385
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,742
A year in which I realised that all I had was merit...

386
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,959
A knick-knack no one really needed in the modern world...

387
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,399
A year in which I'd begun to loathe myself...

388
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,398
All the more whenever I'd look at Zoya...

389
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,608
Who'd rather starve herself to stand by me

390
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,958
Than complain...

391
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,448
Zoya, who'd taken up arms against her family for me...

392
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,158
Me, who couldn't even provide her three square meals a day...

393
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,668
It was just another day hoppin' between offices

394
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:51,210
When, consumed in fury, self-loathing, and anguish all together...

395
00:29:51,370 --> 00:30:00,930
'NBFUK'
'Monthly allowance for the needful and disabled - 25 thousand Rupees'

396
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,220
Sir...

397
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,433
Could you tell me the address?

398
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,298
I decided...

399
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,851
To end my life...

400
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,111
But my eyes fell on a banner...
'25 thousand Rupees'

401
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,409
I was tired of asking for what was rightfully mine...

402
00:30:36,498 --> 00:30:39,357
It was finally time to get my hands on it!

403
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,247
I told Zoya I got a job...

404
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,048
But the truth is, for the last six months...

405
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:08,210
I'd leave for 'work'

406
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:11,588
And spend the day in the park...

407
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,499
I'd give my allowance to Zoya, telling her it's my salary...

408
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,798
Until today, when Curtis came knocking...

409
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,168
Saying he wants to see my wife!

410
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,788
I'm looking my ruin in the eye...

411
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,658
Please, luvvie...

412
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,578
Don't make me tear up...

413
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,338
Kashif?

414
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,518
Don't worry... You're introducing Curtis to your wife...

415
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:49,801
And he won't have a clue! So...

416
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,351
<i>And he won't have a clue! So...
I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

417
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:51,761
<i>Don't... Don't you worry, m'love!
I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

418
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:53,800
<i>Don't... Don't you worry, m'love!
Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

419
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,942
<i>Don't... Don't you worry, m'love!
When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

420
00:31:54,942 --> 00:31:55,891
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

421
00:31:55,891 --> 00:31:57,980
<i>And pushed me to extremes!</i>

422
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,028
<i>I got in a bit of a tizzy,</i>

423
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:02,038
<i>Fate made me a bit dizzy...</i>

424
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,199
<i>Until it blew my mind!</i>

425
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,248
Kashif...

426
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:10,940
You better do this right...

427
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,380
Don't worry, Marlin, you've got quite the player on your team!

428
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,738
Don't get caught!
-I won't, boyo! Don't worry!

429
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:22,014
Wait here. I'll tell Curtis you're back.

430
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,538
Here's a tip.

431
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:29,128
Light a cigarette too.

432
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:32,309
You told Curtis your wife smokes?

433
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:35,609
I don't remember telling him my wife sits like that either!

434
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:37,139
Marlin!

435
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:38,379
Zoya?

436
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,620
Who's -- That?

437
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,159
That --

438
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,020
Well, that's --

439
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,836
I asked you who that is.

440
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,750
Ka -- Kashif, you know?

441
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,530
She's his friend...

442
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,688
I told you, he's upstairs, okay?

443
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,978
How come you're back so early, darling?

444
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:08,230
I saw Ayesha, and guess what?

445
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,338
She told me to start next week.

446
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:12,067
Guess someone's a bludger...

447
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:15,090
You sent me for nothing. Anyway, gotta get some rest...

448
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,155
No way!

449
00:33:16,155 --> 00:33:18,170
You can't go in there.

450
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,176
Why?

451
00:33:19,211 --> 00:33:19,974
You know --

452
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:22,355
I'm having this awful headache, mate...

453
00:33:22,355 --> 00:33:24,326
Could you get me a cuppa?

454
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,990
Sure thing. Just lemme change?

455
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,248
Blimey, man!

456
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:31,590
You want to change first? I'll make some myself! Don't bother!
-What's wrong with you?

457
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,318
What's with the anger? Gimme a moment...

458
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:35,586
Fair 'nuff...

459
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,760
Hmph...

460
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,570
I'm gonna barge in and kill ya!

461
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,870
You owe me 534,515.

462
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,351
I'm gonna make Bobby it goes ter someone 'oo deserves it! I'm not scared of ya!

463
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,130
No one, get it?

464
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,591
We clear?

465
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,460
Bog off!

466
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,731
Hmm...

467
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,842
The lady's here, Mr Curt!
-M'lady -- What?

468
00:34:32,842 --> 00:34:36,081
How'd she get here? I thought I --

469
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,980
Not your lady... Mine! Come...

470
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,340
Can't you bark calmly?
-Ehh?

471
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,917
Actually -- You don't see it... Keep at it... Keep blabberin'!

472
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,280
Can't stay awake when I'm not chewin' some betel... You almost gave me a heart attack, laddie! Which way?

473
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,538
Here. Come with me.
-Gimme a moment...

474
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,377
This way, sir...

475
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,695
Fate, it seems, had me outdone,

476
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:06,980
Why are we back where we begun?

477
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,948
Aye, where's she?

478
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,370
Upstairs, sir.

479
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,909
Call her down here.

480
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,759
She'd rather not come here.

481
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:15,778
Why?

482
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,808
You know...

483
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,410
She stays upstairs today.

484
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,427
Cut the codswallop!

485
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,573
It's nothing, really, sir...

486
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:25,220
Just -- Her 'me time', you know?

487
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,849
She stays in her room one day. I stay the next.

488
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:31,180
That's one way we can say we're happily married without lying through our teeth.

489
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,990
(And they told me the happy part came from being together --) I mean -- When d'you have your 'we time'?

490
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,588
Sundays?

491
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,357
Every Sunday.

492
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,730
Just -- Come with me...

493
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,109
Marlin!

494
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:22,318
Marlin! Open the door!

495
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,050
Marlin!

496
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,258
Marlin!

497
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,870
Jeez...

498
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,612
I'll show you the way...

499
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,360
What's that noise?

500
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,340
It's all black to me, sir... What noise?

501
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,397
Your brain's blacked out too...

502
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:48,428
You hear with your ears, see with your eyes, aye?
-Aye, sir... 'Course...

503
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:51,080
Why do I get a feeling your wife's down here?

504
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,680
No, sir, that's not my wife -- Stay away from her! She's a witch, I tell you!

505
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,010
Don't worry, laddie, I've got one at home too.
-You don't get it, sir!

506
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,520
A real one, sir! That witch comes 'round here sometimes...

507
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,208
And -- I've heard she never spares strangers!

508
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:09,508
Wh -- What now?

509
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:15,581
J -- Just go upstairs sharpish! I'll deal with her! Go! Before it's too late!
-Upstairs? Yeah?

510
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,791
Thank goodness...

511
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,060
Hi...
-Why'd you bolt the door?

512
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,551
No -- I -- Don't think I did?

513
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,761
Who've we got in here except the two of us?

514
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:37,885
How do I know? I can't see, you know...

515
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,005
What?

516
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:41,616
Just kidding, mate...

517
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:42,956
Tea?

518
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,528
What's with the sunglasses and stick?

519
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,060
That?

520
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,017
Well, just -- Preparing for when I'm blind.

521
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:54,989
What?

522
00:37:54,989 --> 00:37:55,968
Aye.

523
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:56,789
Why?

524
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,680
Uhh...

525
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,161
Just -- Getting some practice, you know? Who knows what the future holds?

526
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:05,813
I thought I'd prepare for the worst case scenario... Get it?

527
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,970
What the devil is wrong with you? You all right upstairs?

528
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,370
Aye, never been better...

529
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:19,380
Is it ready? My cuppa? This awful headache's killin' me... Nothing your tea can't cure though! Gimme...

530
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,718
Thank you.

531
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:27,118
Don't you think you should -- You know -- Change now?

532
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,958
Good girl.

533
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,098
I'm losin' it...

534
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,328
Your name, please?

535
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,958
Yes, please.

536
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,937
Blimey, I asked for your name!

537
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:49,778
Kashif...

538
00:38:49,778 --> 00:38:51,068
Ehh?

539
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,617
Zoya Kashif.

540
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,008
Zoya...

541
00:38:58,538 --> 00:38:59,959
Kashif...?

542
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,027
Zoya Kashif...

543
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,527
<i>Zoya Kashif?</i>

544
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:11,970
But... Aren't you married to Marlin? Aye? How d'you explain that?

545
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,967
Very high IQ, I must say!

546
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,767
But, regrettably,

547
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,639
This society

548
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,188
Cannot conceive a woman's identity as distinct from her husband's...

549
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,058
Regrettably,

550
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:36,108
She doesn't have a name she can call her own...

551
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,599
She's always chained in one surname or another...

552
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:43,969
Why?

553
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,198
Her old man's name before her marriage...

554
00:39:50,078 --> 00:39:56,969
And her husband's aft -- Old man's -- Ka -- K -- Kashif's me ol -- Father's name...

555
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,649
When'd he lose his sight?

556
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,074
God bless him...

557
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:08,518
He's 70 but with a perfect 6/6 vision!

558
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:11,521
I meant your husband!

559
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:14,071
(I never asked him!)

560
00:40:14,124 --> 00:40:16,200
Aye? I asked something!

561
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,168
Uh -- Well -- Gimme a few options and I'll pick...

562
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,210
We playin' Millionaire 'ere? I'm askin' about your husband, young lady!

563
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,868
What's it matter?

564
00:40:31,147 --> 00:40:34,738
Our life's been pitch-black ever since...

565
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,548
Every day moonless,

566
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:41,329
Every night starless...

567
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,079
Easy...
-No!

568
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,680
You need to get a grip on yourself...
-NO!

569
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,758
Excuse me...

570
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,789
'Keep him busy until I say it's clear down here'

571
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,788
I guess I'll take my leave...

572
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,268
No --

573
00:41:08,317 --> 00:41:10,427
You can't leave just yet...

574
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:14,338
I'm done here. Why'd I --
-Curtis...

575
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,358
You're so selfish...

576
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:19,429
You'd slip away sharpish the moment you're done?

577
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,848
I mean --

578
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,509
I ain't gonna let you go... Until you've had some of my finest tea!

579
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,760
No, thanks, that won't be necessary...
-Uhh...

580
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,649
I say it is. Please, take a seat...

581
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,250
Please... Take a seat...

582
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,818
I'll get us both a cuppa.

583
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:42,338
No way, I'm done here. I shouldn't be stayin' here too long...
-CURTIS!

584
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,599
You wanna slip away when you're done?

585
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,000
I won't let you go until you've had a nice cuppa!

586
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,601
No, thank you, I'd rather not --

587
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:54,262
But I would!

588
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,582
I need some right now.

589
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,731
Please...

590
00:41:57,731 --> 00:41:59,121
I beg you.

591
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,040
Just -- Some water...

592
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,670
And some tea after that. I insist.

593
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,517
Now you sit here like a really good kitten, and I'll be right back!

594
00:42:07,517 --> 00:42:09,257
Meow!

595
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,768
Meow???

596
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,378
Me giddy Aunt that's...!

597
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:25,107
You sent me to Ayesha's office so you could enjoy your little date with her!
-Date?

598
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:28,360
You said she's Kashif's friend when I got back...

599
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,428
And locked me in the kitchen!

600
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:33,428
<i>You are so caught in the act now!</i>

601
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,410
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

602
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,510
<i>'Blind Love'
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

603
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,140
'Blind Love'

604
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,440
Marlin!

605
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,302
Marlin!

606
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:46,963
Double time!

607
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,818
What is it?

608
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,550
Curtis wanted to leave but I've managed to stop him for tea.

609
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,500
I'll get some fritters and sweets too.
-Okay.

610
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,108
Blimey, mate! Just let him go already!

611
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:03,000
I thought you texted me to keep him busy!

612
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,540
Change o' plans. Zoya's in her room. Now's the chance. Get him outta here ASAP!

613
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,561
Okay.

614
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:09,190
Kashif...

615
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,259
Aye?

616
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,477
You ain't just a friend... You're my life!

617
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:18,533
I'm gettin' all dewy-eyed!
-I love you! Here!

618
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,238
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

619
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:28,923
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

620
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,629
<i>MARLIN!
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

621
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:31,190
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

622
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,630
<i>(Oopsie!)
Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

623
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:34,600
Z -- Zoya?

624
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,720
That chuffin' chippy!
-(Gotta disappear!)

625
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,600
I'm gonna kill her!
-Calm down! What's wrong with you?

626
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:48,110
<i>What's wrong with me? You -- You blasted cheat! That hag called you at the restaurant yesterday, didn't she? That cow!</i>

627
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:49,988
That's when you planned it, innit?

628
00:43:49,988 --> 00:43:56,390
You sent me to Ayesha's office so you could enjoy your little date with her!

629
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,660
Date?
-Aye!

630
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,707
No way, mate!

631
00:43:58,707 --> 00:44:02,701
Holy Mary! You said she's Kashif's friend when I got back...

632
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:04,767
And locked me in the kitchen!

633
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,637
<i>You are so caught in the act now!</i>

634
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:11,950
<i>I'll deal with you later! She is so dead!
-Hey! Mate! Gimme a moment to explain! Lemme tell yo --</i>

635
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,530
<i>She is so dead, and SO ARE YOU!
-Hey! Zoya! Zoya! It's me! Kashif!</i>

636
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,040
Kashif?

637
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,046
What's wrong with you? Look at yourself!

638
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,327
Why don't you ask Marlin?

639
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,760
Kashif!

640
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,427
That's my dress he's --

641
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,958
Don't worry.

642
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,998
I'll tell you everything.

643
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,798
Zoya! What's wrong with you? Lemme explain!

644
00:44:45,798 --> 00:44:47,110
Explain what?

645
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,959
What are you gonna say? What's left for you to say, Marlin?

646
00:44:50,118 --> 00:44:53,117
We've been living off charity?

647
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:56,208
There was a time I'd take pride in your uprightness!

648
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:58,558
You've crumpled that image!

649
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,848
I ain't stayin' with you another moment!

650
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:01,969
Please, Zoya!

651
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:04,129
Please listen to me!

652
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,610
Who is it?

653
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,008
Good day.

654
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,678
Good day, sir.

655
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:23,807
Jiya Effendi.

656
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,978
From the Royal Trust.

657
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,418
I've got some questions for you.

658
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,078
Ah... Aye...

659
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:34,459
I get it...

660
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,561
Come in. Please...

661
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,088
After you.

662
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,788
Please...

663
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,078
You didn't have to come all the way...

664
00:45:50,078 --> 00:45:53,088
You could've just asked me to come...

665
00:45:53,178 --> 00:45:56,018
I'd like to see your wife, Mr Marlin.

666
00:45:56,158 --> 00:45:58,619
Just want to ask her some questions.

667
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,558
Nothing much... Just a few minutes...

668
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:03,719
A few minutes?

669
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,818
That's all?

670
00:46:04,818 --> 00:46:06,178
Of course.

671
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:09,468
Please, take a seat. I'll send her here.

672
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,850
Okay.

673
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,870
Kashif!

674
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,318
Kashif!

675
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:29,908
Okay...

676
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>Definitely not okay.</i>

677
00:46:32,847 --> 00:46:35,889
Do I look okay? I've been starvin' --

678
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:40,363
I almost died just now, and you think it's okay?

679
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,598
Just -- Put on your scarf and come with me.
-I ain't goin' anywhere. It's no use now.

680
00:46:45,598 --> 00:46:48,047
Zoya knows everything!

681
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:51,678
Jiya's here, you know...

682
00:46:51,714 --> 00:46:53,435
Who's Jiya?

683
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,188
You know, uh... From the Royal Trust?

684
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:58,938
<i>The Royal what?</i>

685
00:46:58,938 --> 00:47:00,999
Another trust?

686
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:09,909
Can I trust you to tell me all the parts of your body you've damaged or lost to win their trust?

687
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,298
Just one last time, mate...

688
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,768
See her so she leaves pronto!

689
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:16,617
No.

690
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:18,327
No blasted way!

691
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:23,857
I ain't helpin' you in any of your scams, like, ever!

692
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,918
Kashif...

693
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,299
Boyo... Aren't we bros?

694
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,628
Doesn't quite look like it to me... No way, we ain't no bros or something. Find someone else.

695
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,969
Wonder who you would be?

696
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,003
We're pals, mate.

697
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:55,669
Just once?

698
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,748
Good day, ma'am.

699
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,395
I'm from the Royal Trust.

700
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,236
This 'help' is a crime!

701
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,826
And I ain't helping you in another crime! No way!

702
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,521
Mr Marlin may have a broken leg, but it is so heartwarming to see he's got your shoulder to lean on...

703
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,658
It's not like I'm enjoyin' it.

704
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:28,467
I've got no choice!

705
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:30,238
But I promise you...

706
00:48:30,238 --> 00:48:34,338
Once they're gone, I'm gonna cancel my registration myself!

707
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,997
I promise you.

708
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,108
But please...

709
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:41,929
Help me out one last time?

710
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,630
Just once?

711
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,862
We've got no shortage of people who'd lie to us...

712
00:48:50,892 --> 00:48:55,912
That's why we're asking these questions... We're working to weed out the leeches...

713
00:48:55,912 --> 00:49:00,503
Fine them, and send where they belong - in the nick!

714
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,999
Looks like you don't need me anymore.

715
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,450
Break a leg, tough guy!
-Kashif!

716
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,780
What do I tell you...

717
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:13,897
Uhh...

718
00:49:13,897 --> 00:49:15,950
Mr Marlin! Please, take a seat.

719
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,510
That's Zoya...

720
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:18,958
My wife.

721
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,478
Yeah, we just met.

722
00:49:21,588 --> 00:49:24,692
We've been talking 'bout you, you know.
-Ohh...

723
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:28,798
Excuse me, where's the loo?

724
00:49:28,798 --> 00:49:31,179
Over there.

725
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,598
Thank you.

726
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:41,480
Seems someone forgot to tell me he's got a broken leg too.

727
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,802
Don't worry, I didn't tell her anything.

728
00:49:44,865 --> 00:49:46,672
Thank you so much.

729
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,781
'ThANk yOu sO MUcH'! Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

730
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,938
Zoya... I can explain...

731
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:56,969
Once Jiya and Curtis are outta here...

732
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,188
If they found out,

733
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:00,798
I'll be thrown in the nick,

734
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,028
Not to mention the fines I'd have to pay!

735
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,158
Y -- You! To the dickens with you!
-Hey!
-I -- Ow!

736
00:50:07,158 --> 00:50:08,767
Oww...

737
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,649
Argh!

738
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,698
Ow!

739
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,442
Kashif!

740
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,053
Kashif! You alright?

741
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:20,173
Kashif?

742
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:21,574
Kashif!

743
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?

744
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad? Here --

745
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya! M'girl!

746
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

747
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kashif!

748
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up!

749
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, boyo?

750
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up!

751
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kashif!

752
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up!
-Mrs Munro!

753
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Zoya Kashif Munro!

754
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Been a while since you left to make me a cuppa...

755
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! What happened here? How'd she fall down? And why?

756
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you see?
-Ehh?

757
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- I don't, but -- Don't you?
-Aye...

758
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dunno... She tripped maybe?
-Oh...

759
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you take her upstairs?

760
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll -- Get some hot turmeric --

761
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hot milk with turmeric...

762
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take my hand.
-Hey!
-Take <i>my</i> hand.</i>

763
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

764
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up, hun.

765
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Careful...

766
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you...

767
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

768
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take you upstairs.

769
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Careful, okay?
-Of course!

770
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be careful, okay?

771
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the devil is going on?

772
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, it took me a while...

773
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

774
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

775
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's perfectly okay...

776
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your wife?

777
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh...

778
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, she --

779
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you take a seat?

780
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

781
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad... Come in...

782
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and Dad...

783
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh...

784
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Jiya... From the office... Nothing much... Just got a few things to ask...

785
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

786
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you come see my room?
<i>I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

787
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you come see my room?
<i>Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

788
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This way!
<i>Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

789
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This way!
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

790
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

791
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And pushed me to extremes!</i>

792
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I got in a bit of a tizzy,</i>

793
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Fate made me a bit dizzy...</i>

794
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Until it blew my mind!</i>

795
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

796
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Jaysus...)
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Couldn't you pick another day?)
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

799
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

800
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like to have something? A cuppa? A cold drink, maybe?

801
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God, it kills me... Mum!

802
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

803
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He beat me!

804
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?

805
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blind bloke?

806
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't he see -- ?

807
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it any different if her husband's blind, lame, or not...

808
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wives always get beaten about...

809
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Break my heart but not my bones!

810
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

811
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way Curtis is forgivin' domestic abuse! I'm gonna fix that blind wretch!

812
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Courtesy...

813
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Courtesy?

814
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave me alone in here...

815
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, I... OW!

816
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please... Lie down... Easy...

817
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow...

818
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy there... It's nothing...

819
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No... I can't take it anymore...

820
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here?
-Yes, sir.

821
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

822
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And here.

823
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another?

824
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here?

825
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

826
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

827
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

828
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much!

829
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hope you're... Satisfied?

830
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Thank you so much.

831
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pay attention to this important announcement!

832
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Due to rising COVID-19 cases...

833
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
16th Street and 17th Street are quarantined!

834
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one is allowed in or out!

835
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Government announces a complete lockdown until everyone in the area is tested!

836
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your cooperation is requested. Thank you.

837
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

838
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M'love...

839
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're Curtis's life! And Curtis, but the dust under your feet!

840
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I was just investigating someone when --

841
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They quarantined the whole street!

842
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't stay here!

843
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course you can't!

844
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need to leave right away. Double time!
-Aye. I'll get going.

845
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much. Take care!
-Aye. Take care!

846
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget to close the door!
-Sure.

847
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness...

848
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good half-riddance.

849
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you not to force me to go to Karachi.

850
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I died of COVID-19 in here, you're responsible for it!

851
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

852
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Life and death are in the Lord's hands, and His hands alone.

853
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides...

854
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The virus is spreading all over the country...

855
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

856
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, relax...

857
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's gonna be alright.

858
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hammer some sense into your Dad.

859
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness Jiya's gone.

860
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Zoya?

861
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In her room.

862
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her Mum and Dad are here.

863
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whe -- Here?

864
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That just means --
-Aye?

865
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.

866
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna curse your mate like that?

867
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye aye, Your Highness.

868
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. Your man's gonna update you every hour.

869
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let you or your faith in me down.

870
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course!

871
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care, hun.

872
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gordon Bennett!

873
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're lucky

874
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Mum and Dad got here.

875
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't tell them about the real you because I don't want to embarrass myself!

876
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I chose <i>you</i> over them.</i>

877
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And <i>you</i>!</i>

878
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, Zoya?

879
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got a point there.

880
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it.

881
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And could you please take my gown off, clean it, and give it back?

882
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I'd give it back right away -- But -- Curtis is upstairs and -- I haven't got a replacement, so...

883
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

884
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's right...

885
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- He's right...

886
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry...

887
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast!

888
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?
-Don't you know these streets have been locked down?

889
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please let me go...

890
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just here for an inquiry...

891
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got my mask on! Lemme go back --

892
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, ma'am. Orders from the top. No one goes in or out.

893
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back.

894
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That --

895
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't my place!

896
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's gonna be so worried if I didn't go back!

897
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please lemme go...
-I hope you know that if, God forbid, you got infected, you're gonna take the virus straight to her doorstep!

898
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way we're riskin' it, ma'am.

899
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think you're doing?
-What d'you think you're doing?

900
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tryin' to bribe a cop?

901
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

902
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Don't you folks normally take it?

903
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not really.

904
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not this time, at least.
-Aye.

905
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back.
-Aye, back where you came from.

906
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please let me go, sir...

907
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just doing my duty.

908
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just here to inquire...

909
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last warning! Go back where you came from!
-Can't you hear me? Go back right now!

910
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- Mum's all alone...

911
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's best for you to go back.
-Right now!

912
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back!
-You hear me? BACK!

913
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...
-RIGHT NOW!

914
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get a move on!

915
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how your lovely son-in-law honours us!

916
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Half an hour since we got here, and he hasn't even bothered to greet us!

917
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal.

918
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how <i>you</i> honoured your son-in-law. For an entire year!</i>

919
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mr Siddiqui... Don't expect respect when you didn't give any.

920
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? You want me to fall at his feet?

921
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came here because you told me to.

922
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now that you're here, why don't you be a bit more generous?

923
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps even say sorry for how you treated him?

924
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

925
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say sorry? Like, for real?

926
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

927
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair 'nuff.

928
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to book a ticket back home.

929
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, are you blackmailing me?

930
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might be.

931
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blackmailed me for an entire year.

932
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've missed my girl for an entire year.

933
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't begging for his forgiveness or something.

934
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who asked you to beg forgiveness?

935
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pull him into a warm embrace... Burn the cold bitterness with the warmth!

936
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

937
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Marlin!

938
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Marlin!

939
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Marlin!

940
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec!

941
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

942
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

943
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec, Dad!

944
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess no one needs me...

945
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

946
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard me in a moment!

947
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess I should've asked for something else...

948
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Marlin...

949
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't stop me now, Zoya!

950
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare that blind bugger touch you? I'll never forgive him!
-B -- But --

951
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I already forgave him...

952
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the most courteous forgive someone, the others should follow suit too.

953
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd <i>you</i> say sorry to him? No way!</i>

954
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... For your happiness...

955
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And to put everything that's happened behind us...

956
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

957
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you see he's got a broken leg?
-The name's Curtis! Top tyke in town! That's his wife there, ask her!

958
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- His wife's right here! Zoya!
-Ehh?

959
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem with me, you Chinese knockoff Judi Dench?

960
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

961
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Blind Love'
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

962
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Blind Love'

963
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Who is it this time?)

964
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You?

965
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

966
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The cops won't let me go!

967
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I literally begged them!

968
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they're like, 'No one goes in or out'!

969
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay, easy there... Come in...

970
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How will I go back?

971
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure we can work something out.

972
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make yourself at home here. Don't leave this room. What if -- I'm infected and you caught COVID-19 from me?

973
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

974
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Prevention...

975
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is always better...

976
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Than cure!

977
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmph!

978
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down, ma'am... Please... Get a grip on yourself!

979
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know the virus is spreading so fast!

980
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows...

981
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of us... Me... Or my wife... May be infected!

982
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

983
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

984
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a tip...

985
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave this room.

986
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay? I don't want anything happening to you.

987
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

988
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No leavin' this room.

989
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very good. I'll be back...

990
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a moment, okay?

991
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I realise I've been so wrong about Marlin all this time...

992
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to embrace him, and in that warmth, put all this coldness behind us...

993
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

994
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way you're embracing him or something!

995
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

996
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because --

997
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Social distancing, you know?

998
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard the announcement, didn't you? It's spreading!

999
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're staying a good 2 metres from him!

1000
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... It's best if you stay in here... Don't leave this room, okay?

1001
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

1002
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough...

1003
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The cops sent Jiya back. She's in the drawing room.

1004
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad wants to give you a warm embrace and put all the coldness behind.

1005
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Curtis wants to make you pay for every bit of cruelty you've subjected me to.

1006
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you crying?

1007
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't gonna take you home or something.

1008
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just missing me Mum...

1009
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never been away from her this long.

1010
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't sleep without her...

1011
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Does she sing you a nice little lullaby every night?

1012
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa... How'd you -- Read my mind? You're so nice...
-Please -- Social distancing, you know?

1013
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you sing a lullaby for me?

1014
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

1015
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or --

1016
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be up all night... Please?

1017
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

1018
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really wanted to embrace you...

1019
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I guess... Cruel fate stops me...

1020
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be a choking embrace if you knew a thing about cruel fate...

1021
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm impressed by your honesty, uprightness, and self-respect.

1022
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Don't worry...)

1023
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(You ain't gonna be for too long.)

1024
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

1025
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh...

1026
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No -- I mean... Never forget that...

1027
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

1028
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One thing I'd ask of you.

1029
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

1030
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't keep anything to yourself.

1031
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've always got us, m'boy.

1032
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're more our son than son-in-law.

1033
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Just what I wanted to say... Before I lost my words back there.

1034
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess we're both losing something today...

1035
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

1036
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- It's such a blessed day!

1037
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've found Mum and Dad again... In you...

1038
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

1039
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you need some rest.

1040
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme know if you need anything.

1041
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you with a long and happy life.

1042
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya...

1043
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

1044
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no explanation that can satisfy you...

1045
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor the courage to beg forgiveness...

1046
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Punish me any way you like...

1047
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a long list of people to beg forgiveness of.

1048
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If they all forgive you, I'll tell you my decision.

1049
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

1050
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

1051
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

1052
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And pushed me to extremes!</i>

1053
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I got in a bit of a tizzy,</i>

1054
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Fate made me a bit dizzy...</i>

1055
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Until it blew my mind!</i>

1056
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

1057
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

1058
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

1059
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blasted tyrant!

1060
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanna see how you brutalise your English hoe -- Rose?

1061
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the matter? Calm down!

1062
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you leave her poor, frail self to sleep on the floor outside the room?

1063
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She -- what?

1064
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess I didn't see it... I can't see, you see...

1065
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Can't see'? I thought you had a broken leg!

1066
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh...

1067
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

1068
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

1069
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Who's askin'?

1070
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you see he's blind?

1071
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about me. Who in the world are you?

1072
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you're the blind one here! Can't you see he's got a limp?

1073
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you see he's got a broken leg?
-The name's Curtis! Top tyke in town! That's his wife there, ask her!

1074
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
B -- But -- His wife's right here! Zoya!

1075
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?

1076
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem with me, you Chinese knockoff Judi Dench?

1077
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, you tell me he's not blind. Then, you tell me this is not his wife... What the devil is wrong with you?

1078
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just shutting up your lies!

1079
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lame and she's his wife!

1080
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No ma'am, he's blind and <i>Ishe</i>'s his wife!</i>

1081
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lame and she's his wife!
-He's blind and she's his wife!

1082
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ENOUGH!

1083
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not blind...

1084
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or lame...

1085
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just another liar...

1086
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... I'm not his wife...

1087
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm his friend, Kashif...
-Blimey...

1088
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on, Zoya?

1089
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, you flimflammer...

1090
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been living off our allowance for the last six months, pretending to be blind?

1091
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just yours, he's been living off our allowance for the lame for the last six months too!

1092
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You cheat! You've been living off charity? What'd my daughter do to deserve this?

1093
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe I was awed by your uprightness!

1094
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhm!

1095
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After I'm through with you...

1096
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Generations to come will remember what you --

1097
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

1098
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your name's Curtis...

1099
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But all I see is the most discourteous man I've ever met!

1100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the top tyke in town!
-Can it!

1101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you want?

1102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want to send me to the nick?

1103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, call the cops. Arrest me.

1104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the blasted limit!

1105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've done my Masters!

1106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With a first... Straight As all the way...

1107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... Medals, grades, certificates... I might as well burn 'em all...

1108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I find they're useless to me...

1109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no place in the city I haven't applied to...

1110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you know what they want?

1111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A sweetener.

1112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A 'recommendation' from the toffs...

1113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got neither...

1114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one - including me - loves to live off charity.

1115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the status quo, the system...

1116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forces a wise and capable man...

1117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To use his wisdom in all the wrong ways...

1118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hunger...

1119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Numbs the mind... The conscience...

1120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until... It doesn't feel wrong at all...

1121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could bear the hunger...

1122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as it was just my own...

1123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But someone else depended on me...

1124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had everything in life, every luxury...

1125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She chose me over it all...

1126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because she believed in me...

1127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She could see my potential...

1128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think...

1129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have any regret...

1130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I deserve to be punished for all I did...

1131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So please... Arrest me...

1132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sell this house...

1133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take back every penny I took from your NGOs...

1134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Consider whatever's left my donation to you...

1135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it's never gonna be home again...

1136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, looks like a zoo to me. You done yet?

1137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely speech... Give him a huge hand, will ya?

1138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was bang-on brilliant, me lad...

1139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme tell ya wot 'appened. Ya thought ya could brin' Curtis ter tears.

1140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Curtis 'as got a heart of stone! Get it? Stone!

1141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme call 999. Get sum cavalry in...
-Wait.

1142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast.

1143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pay back every penny he's taken from your charities.

1144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Too late, sir. Ya daan't kna me.

1145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say I'm loike Sylvester Stallone... Quite accurately, I say.

1146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'E drew first blood, and I'm gonna give 'im a bloody end 'e won't believe!

1147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
... And I'm donating 1.5 million to each of your charities. How's that sound?

1148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ya didn't 'ear the whole fin'...

1149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blood for blood's gonna bleed the whole world ter deaf...

1150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wise words... Wise words indeed!
-'Course...

1151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to do this.

1152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do, my dear.

1153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because, in a way,

1154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm guilty of what's happened too...

1155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I had the same faith in you as Zoya... If I could give you a chance...

1156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None of this would've happened...

1157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry...

1158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've apologised to everyone.

1159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your decision?

1160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can forgive everything...

1161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except...

1162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One cardinal sin...

1163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the tailor ruining my favourite dress weren't enough, you gave it to Kashif who absolutely <i>Idevastated</i> it!</i>

1164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to go, Zoya! He devasted my gender identity, but all you care about is your dress!

1165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to mention this dreadful armache thanks to the flowerpot you threw --

1166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually... Never mind...

1167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, Uncle... Marlin owes me a small amount too... Just about 20 gee or so... It's no big deal, really...

1168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I thought if I got a little cheque too, we'd <i>Iall</i> have a happy ending...</i>

1169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're suckin' diesel!

1170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, you'll get it back.

1171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Sorry!)
