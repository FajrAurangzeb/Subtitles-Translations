1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,455
Lemme work at Ayesha's firm. She's paying so well!

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,917
And I stay home? No way.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:09,595
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... I'm comin' over to your place tomorrow!

4
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:13,438
You'll free your wife from Curtis's grasp... And he won't have a clue!

5
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:19,700
The name's Curtis. Top tyke in town! I know a rotter when I see one!

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,239
May I know your name?

7
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:22,119
Please...

8
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,850
I'm asking you who she is.
-Ka -- Kashif's friend...

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,470
Corona or no corona... You're dead for real, mate.
-Yeah?

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,421
Why do I get a feeling your wife's down here?

11
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,722
Stay away from her! She's a witch, I tell you!

12
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,542
Don't worry about me, I've got one at home too.

13
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:38,723
Aren't we bros?
-Doesn't quite look like it...

14
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:42,570
He's lame and this is his wife!
-He's blind and this is his wife!

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,900
To the dickens with you!
-Hey!
-I -- Ow!

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,410
Wives always get beaten about... Break my heart but not my bones!

17
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,417
'Blind Love'

18
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,338
Good morning!

19
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,398
'Morning...

20
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,839
Your breakfast, Madame.

21
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,290
I would've made something for myself -- Why'd you -- ?

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,693
You do everything six days a week. You deserve a day off.

23
00:02:27,693 --> 00:02:36,358
You go to work six days a week too. Take care of my needs... Comforts... You deserve a day off too.

24
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,634
Hold on...

25
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:39,838
Comforts? Here?

26
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:43,024
Please, Zoya... You left your comforts behind...

27
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:53,119
I mean... The daughter of the owner of Siddiqui and Co., choosing to marry a middle-class man like myself... Angering her father... Leaving her luxuries behind...

28
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,971
Love demands sacrifices, Mr Ali Zuberi.

29
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,419
So, no regrets.

30
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:02,859
Thank you.

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,693
Breakfast? It's getting cold!

32
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,437
Thank you.

33
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,945
And aye... How 'bout going out for lunch?

34
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,206
No way you're wasting another penny!

35
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:19,810
Using the AC's cost us so much already.

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,216
For God's sake, Zoya... These words don't suit you.

37
00:03:24,216 --> 00:03:27,870
(They suit me.) For now, though, I've got the money!

38
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,649
Just save it for later!

39
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:33,444
Besides, all the diners are closed. Thanks to the Coronavirus.

40
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:38,914
Guess what, I've got this friend who knows the right palms to grease. We're going to his diner!

41
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,085
You gonna finish your breakfast or want me to...?

42
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,113
Kashif!

43
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,372
Kashif!

44
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,642
Get up! C'mon!

45
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,878
2 Gee. I want it right now.

46
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,852
Where's your gun?

47
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,099
Gun?

48
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,604
I thought all the robbers carried one.

49
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,170
No -- It's just -- Zoya wants to go out for lunch... And I haven't got my salary yet...

50
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,888
Make her a nice big omelette for now and be done with it. Simple.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,048
A nice big omelette, eh?

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,330
Seriously, Kashif? You've been staying here for weeks. Have I asked you for a penny? Like, ever?

53
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,560
The same old line you say at least ten times a month to rob me of 2 gee every time, which you never return!

54
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,320
Well --
-Would've been better if I paid you a rent instead!

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,926
Forget the rent... Just 2 gee? Your mate's honour's on the line!

56
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,678
Yeah?

57
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:10,270
Maybe next time you'd want to check your wallet before taking her out for lunch...
-Could you just check yours for now?

58
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,711
It's all I've got for now --

59
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,492
It's all I've got for now --
-Aye...

60
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,653
Aye... It'll do!

61
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:16,053
Ali!

62
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,299
A 'thank you' couldn't hurt all that much, could it?

63
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,926
Not now!

64
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,082
Ali!

65
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,920
<i>I gotta thank you?</i>

66
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,820
Osman's wounded her...

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,230
She's broken... Completely...

68
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,060
Why don't you rid yourself of this burden?

69
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,641
Mum says once a girl's married --

70
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,279
Jesus...

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,660
It's been a year since Zoya's marriage... Ali would've demanded money if he was after it!

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,138
You don't know how patient these middle-class folks can be...

73
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:13,120
The day the lights go out of my eyes... Everything that's mine... Will be his...

74
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,068
I don't know it? Seriously?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:31,418
In case you've forgotten, Mr Siddiqui... Before hitting the jackpot, you were no more than a middle-class folk yourself...

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,301
Don't tell me you haven't mixed some water in your shampoo to squeeze every last drop out of it!

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,850
Hey! Keep your voice down!

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,651
Big deal!

79
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:46,871
You shouldn't forget your past like that...

80
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:56,849
You shouldn't forget how hard I've worked all these years... It ain't just about a jackpot or something!

81
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,479
Big deal, Mr Siddiqui!

82
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,369
You won the money but lost your daughter's love.

83
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:06,489
Fathers sacrifice everything for their daughters.

84
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,960
Okay...

85
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,811
I'll forget everything if Zoya leaves that Ali bloke...

86
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,670
Blimey, he's her husband!

87
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,170
Not to me!
-Okay...

88
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,807
Guess I gotta sort a few things out too...

89
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,281
I want no complaints.

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,691
Hey!

91
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,481
Not cricket!

92
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,722
That will be all...

93
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,448
Blimey...

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,658
After you!

95
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,478
Told you no one's gonna be around!

96
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:05,898
Aye, but I would've liked it better at home... But you wanted to go out for lunch...

97
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:11,919
No, Zoya... I really want to see you happy... Don't spoil my mood now...

98
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,450
You really want to see me happy, right?

99
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,778
Yes!

100
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,381
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

101
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,912
Shh!

102
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,227
We've talked about it and you know my decision.

103
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:32,162
What's your problem?
-Zoya...

104
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,157
It's about my self-respect!

105
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:40,959
Like, d'you expect me to stay home? No way!

106
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,249
Guess what your Dad's gonna say? 'He'S LiViNG oFf HiS WiFe'. No way I'm gonna take it quietly!

107
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,529
Your phone's ringing.

108
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,011
Who is it?
-Uhh...

109
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:26,480
My boss... I'll be right back!

110
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,058
Hello?
-Aye...

111
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:42,288
Rashid Zuberi? Sorry -- Ali Zuberi...

112
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,061
Aye...

113
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,386
It's...

114
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:49,056
Curtis from Euroclear...

115
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,238
Good day, sir...

116
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,948
You're the Bacon Rind Heap Of Coke, in'cha?

117
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,709
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

118
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,200
You've been...

119
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,090
You've been... Most kind,

120
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,540
You've been... Most kind, sir...

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,608
I'm comin' over tomorra!

122
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,198
Sir?

123
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,728
Why?

124
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,108
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

125
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:35,088
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

126
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,458
Okay...

127
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,721
When are you coming?

128
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,800
Loike I need an appointment!

129
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll drop by chicken pen I wanna!

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,951
See you!

131
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:50,642
Okay...

132
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:52,193
Bye...

133
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,370
WhEN aRe yOU CoMiNg?

134
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,111
Get me sum Ten Furlongs!

135
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,499
Wow...

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,808
What is it?

137
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:46,350
Nothing... Why?

138
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,501
You look worried... Since your boss called, you know?

139
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,081
Do I?

140
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,500
No?

141
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,581
It's nothing, really...

142
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,661
I was just thinking...

143
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,500
Yeah?

144
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,860
How...

145
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,118
Backward I am!

146
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:11,469
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

147
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:17,199
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

148
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,780
Yeah?
-Hmm...

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,602
Your friend who runs that firm --
-Ayesha.

150
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:27,253
Ayesha.
-Aye, Ayesha!

151
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:33,090
Why don't you call her? You can start tomorrow. Fine by me.

152
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,361
What happened so suddenly?

153
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,070
Nothing... I just really want to see you happy, Zoya. And you're happy, right?

154
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,460
Of course.
-So am I.

155
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,108
Enjoy!

156
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,968
Tried this?

157
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,978
What's up?

158
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,249
What I should've done long ago...

159
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,799
What?

160
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,879
I'm going...

161
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,250
To Karachi...

162
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,517
To my daughter's...

163
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,650
I can't live away from her anymore.

164
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,458
You'd go against me?

165
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,220
No... Only against your bull-headedness.

166
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,230
I got a ticket for you too...

167
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,851
In case you have second thoughts tonight...

168
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,919
And yeah...

169
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,830
If you didn't come with me, don't expect me to come back.

170
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,690
You can live the life you want in this palace, all by yourself...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our charity's been spending 25 gee on you every month for the last six months... Aye?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did ya seriously fin' we'd never goose's Gregory Peck on ya?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then -- Just lemme work at Ayesha's firm! She's paying so nicely! I'd love to help you!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shh!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just thinking...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Backward I am!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you want to work... What's my self-respect got to do with it?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who am I to stop you? If that's what makes you happy, by all means!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm comin' over tomorra!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nah shortage of pretenders 'ere... We just wanna make Bobby... Save this country's name, maybe...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one'd fit three of me! What were you high on?
-No way?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone else's size?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way... No woman can be this big!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've spent five months' savings on it!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way I'm getting another. You're gonna fix this one.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could be this big?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate! Get up! Get ready!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!
-What is it?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you have to go to work?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm starting next week...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? Next week?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with you? Stop shouting!
-What's wrong with <i>you</i>? You've got this job and you're putting it off!</i>

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any idea how many people struggle to get a decent job?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never thought you'd be so thankless!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, no... My bad...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're used to having servants!

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you handle the pressures of a 9-to-5 job, a boss, and yeah, office politics?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This ain't for you, mate?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously? That what you think?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're forcing me...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well then, I'm about to prove you wrong!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye!
-Get ready then! Double time!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make me proud!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zoya!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What now?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sanitiser...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mask...

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck...

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Ali...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time to put up your best act!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I was hidin' in plain sight,</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Chasin' all my wildest dreams,</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When life caught up, gave me a fright,</i>

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And pushed me to extremes!</i>

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I got in a bit of a tizzy,</i>

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Fate made me a bit dizzy...</i>

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Until it blew my mind!</i>

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second!
<i>That's what happens when love turns blind!</i>

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second!
<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>

<i>Yeah, love, my love's turned blind!</i>
