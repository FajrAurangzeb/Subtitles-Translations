1
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,650
Hmm...

2
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,590
'Ty ar rent'? Nah...

3
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,820
'Ty i'w rentu'!

4
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,630
T-Y   I-'-W   R-E-N-T-U.

5
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,979
Actually, no... Write in English. 'House for rent'!

6
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,951
English?

7
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,238
I've spent so much to get you educated! Can't you write it in English?

8
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:22,620
H-O-U-S-E   F-O-R   R-E-N-T! Get to it!

9
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,602
Bedar Khan's here to ruin yah lives!

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,958
Get up y'alls! Bedar Khan's here!

11
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,300
Hey!

12
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,518
Locked?

13
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,138
Lovely...

14
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,899
I knew it...

15
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,531
That's why I came prepared...

16
00:02:56,531 --> 00:03:04,410
I'll have me lunch here... Pray here... And sleep here...

17
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:07,501
Let the waiting begin!

18
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,001
Lemme see who's got the guts to stop me!

19
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,820
Because <i>NO ONE</i> can stop Bedar Khan!

20
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,019
What are you doing, man? Hello?

21
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,350
You gettin' eggs or layin' eggs?

22
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,028
Got to lay in wait up on the top floor!

23
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:37,800
They curfewed the city or something?
-I got yah!

24
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,450
I've had me eyes on you for so long!

25
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,240
Dead...

26
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,241
Just wait 'til I get me hands on ya!
-What's Bedar Khan doing here?

27
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,381
He'd kill us for real!

28
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:59,604
Don't underestimate him! And -- Thank goodness you locked the door from outside!
-Alright, listen...

29
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:05,291
Stay quiet.
-Don't try anything smart! Okay?

30
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:11,590
Motor vehicles underwent changes in the 1980s and 90s... Just pray I ace this exam, Annie!

31
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,201
What, you got an exam? When? Today?

32
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,940
My second-last paper, remember?

33
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,790
On Sunday?
-It's Sunday?

34
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,651
Aye... You had your paper on Monday... Tuesday... -ish?

35
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,718
Blimey... This psychology paper's makin' me a blimmin' PSYCHO!

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,848
Can't disagree there, Eve...

37
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:41,158
And... What are you wearing?
-What?

38
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,690
Shut up!

39
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,110
You may not know it but -- It's in vogue!

40
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,000
Get me some breakfast!

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,030
I'll sort you out later... Your Puny Majesty!

42
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,740
C'mon, write it!

43
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,470
And if you can't, pull your ears and stand over there all day!

44
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,620
'Allo?

45
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,200
Ie?

46
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,981
Eh?

47
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,122
Fell down?

48
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,331
Down the mynydd?

49
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:24,920
To the dickens with you! Book a ticket for me, I'm headed for Beddgelert right away!

50
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,290
Book a flight! I don't care how much it costs!

51
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,058
Caewch i fyny! I'm comin' right away!

52
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:38,736
Curse my luck! I'm comin', son...

53
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,009
Put it up straight... Nah, it's too much to the right!

54
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,737
You sure this won't help us get the right sorta tenants, Naina?
-Annie! Annie!

55
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,941
What's this?

56
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:54,472
Putting up this poster for the annex...

57
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:59,120
Wasn't it enough to put it up on the internet?
-Not enough to get a tenant, apparently!

58
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:08,347
Well, it's me your clients are bugging! And -- Mrs Randhawa would be here any moment!
-Goodness... What makes these women so...!

59
00:06:08,347 --> 00:06:11,188
By the way, that's my marker and tape you're using!

60
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:15,960
How'd I put it up?
-Why don't you ask your sweet Annie?

61
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,409
'House for rent'

62
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:22,798
God, I'm gonna die... My BP's dropping...

63
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:27,030
Just kick Bedar Khan out!

64
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,470
Get up!
-What is it?

65
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:35,790
I can't take it anymore... We need to move out.
-Aye... For the love of God... Let's just leave this place...

66
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,720
Gimme that... I'm honestly starving...
-Bedar Khan!

67
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:53,532
Mam! Mam! Okay, stop... You can just sit across the pond and talk! But Annie's not interested in this proposal! All she cares about is her annex... Or her gym classes!

68
00:06:53,532 --> 00:06:59,808
Yeah why don't you say that to Mam-gu? I'm here to study, okay? So keep me out of it. Bye.

69
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,198
Aye, I'll have my lunch... Bye...

70
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,060
Iesu Grist...

71
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,230
Hello? Aye, Crime Master Koko here!

72
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,248
Yeah, it's her assistant.

73
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:15,790
How many? We're renting the annex, not a village! No way.

74
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,420
What was that?

75
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,291
Naina ma'am's clear we don't want to rent the place to many people.
-Well, why don't you let her do what she wants?

76
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:34,390
As the man in the house - and the servant - it's my duty too...
-Your Tad sent you here to study, young man! Why don't you open your books for a change?

77
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,480
Not books... It's the exams I dread, Milord!

78
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,930
Ehh?

79
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,476
Just turn around...

80
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,450
Watch out!

81
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,110
Stop!
-Wait here.

82
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,797
Ow...

83
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,858
Heavens, mate... Can't you see where you're going?

84
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:12,529
Annie!

85
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,850
What happened?

86
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,348
Mrs Randhawa's fine! Just -- her nail chipped, okay?

87
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:22,758
All the clients left me!

88
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,180
For?

89
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,688
They left the gym, smarty!

90
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:33,600
They're scared they may break something like Mrs Randhawa.

91
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,818
Get her a tissue, Koko! Right now! From the car.

92
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:42,640
Easy there, Annie... It's okay... They were burdening the earth anyway...

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:53,860
Easy for you to say. My gym's empty. No one's renting the annex. My business is failing. How d'you expect me to take it easy?

94
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:05,050
Oh, forget this place... Think of where you're going... The people around you... And the match Mam picked for you?
-Never! Get it?

95
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,738
I can't think of anyone but Alastair Brook!

96
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:14,420
He was your fiancé! Not your husband! You'll find someone!

97
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:21,650
No, there's nobody like him! There will be nobody like him! Alastair Brook... A babbling brook brimming with perfection...

98
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:29,608
Lovely eyes... Enchanting style... Wonderful personality... That melodious voice singing poetry in every word...

99
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:35,580
The man in the tuxedo looking at me from under that hat...

100
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,710
There's nobody like him in the world! There can be nobody!

101
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,050
Okay, but... Just... Get some rest...
'To Let'

102
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,040
I've got an exam tomorrow, I gotta study. Checking on Mrs Randhawa's wasted enough time already...

103
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:01,728
Your Mam's ravin' mad! 67th time she's calling me! Looks like she got nothin' else to do there on the other side of the pond! You better sort it out with her, okay? Come!

104
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,698
This one?

105
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,038
Yeah?

106
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,968
You outta your mind? Who d'you think you are?
-Aye, so what?

107
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:12,398
My Dad's got a bigger mansion in Devon!

108
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:18,368
You mean the one you got kicked out of for this love of acting?
-As if your Dad booked you a flight to LA.

109
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,350
I ain't staying anywhere else. Willy-nilly.

110
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,620
You'd get us killed.

111
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,170
Never underestimate what Shobi can do!

112
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,089
I got this one...

113
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,579
C'mon...

114
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:43,258
You know my business is failing! And all you care about is my marriage?

115
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:50,940
Oh, I've heard this before... You're the older sister, you love and care for your little sister...

116
00:10:50,940 --> 00:11:02,470
Eve's leaving for your place in a month, I'll be left alone, and you'll be left worrying... I know all of that but I don't care!

117
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:12,400
I'm not going to Tad in Toronto. In case you don't remember, Alastair Brook died because of him! He had an accident after meeting Tad!

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,630
You know how sensitive he was! I can't forget it for a moment!

119
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,358
Goodness --

120
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,358
You --

121
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:26,998
I'm so disturbed... I'll talk to you later...

122
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:33,454
Just -- Why... Why do you have to bring him up every time?

123
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,148
Yes, sir?

124
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,300
Could you call the man of the house?
-What do I look like?

125
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,900
A kiddo?
-It's Crime Master Koko, okay?
-Of course...

126
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,680
We're here to talk about this notice, sir... Could you call someone who'd...?

127
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,648
Just a minute. Lemme throw this out.

128
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,021
The kid's the real deal, mate...

129
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,418
Aye.
-Come in...

130
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,489
C'mon...

131
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,882
Whoa!

132
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,810
Always the embarrassment, eh?
-Who is it?
-Whoa!
-Hey!

133
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,733
You dropped all my papers!
-Good Lord...

134
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,808
Who are they?
-Our new tenants. Here to see Naina ma'am...

135
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,208
Take them to her... What are they doing here?

136
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,909
Shahabuddin Shobi and Böri.

137
00:12:54,268 --> 00:12:55,691
Please...

138
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,770
Don't cover those sightly eyes...

139
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,498
Take them in.
-Ma'am.

140
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:10,949
Come.
-Kiddo?

141
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:13,369
Aye...

142
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,021
Theatre or film... Hollywood or BBC...

143
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:39,700
You ain't getting this annex until I've met your family.

144
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:46,840
As if we're here with a proposal...
-What? What was that?

145
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,990
Get up! What was that just now?

146
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,540
He means -- Our families don't live here...
-Then how'd <i>you</i> think you could live here?

147
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,500
We're new here...

148
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,790
We're looking for a place to stay until we've bought a mansion ourselves...
-I can totally see that...

149
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,708
What?

150
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,688
That you're here to buy a mansion...

151
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:19,930
What's your problem?
-We don't let men stay here without their families.

152
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,550
I'm sure we can get along... Like a family?
-Ehh? What?
-What d'you think you're doing?

153
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:33,869
I can have the cops vouch for me right now if that's what you --
-Oh, can it...

154
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:38,340
Go and get your parents to vouch for you instead.

155
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,300
Clear? Now get goin'!

156
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,421
Which, in case you don't get it, means get out!

157
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,360
Ma'am...

158
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:00,490
Our parents... Aren't with us anymore...
-Aww... You've got no one? Well, then...

159
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,230
Why don't you go to an orphanage instead?

160
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,830
C'mon, now! Get out!
-...Except -- That one Uncle...

161
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:15,590
Yeah! Of course! In Swansea, remember?
-Yeah? Okay -- Ah, yes, him! Yeah! Swansea!

162
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:23,658
Got a name?
-A big name! Tell her! Very famous -- A writer... An intellectual...
-He's very famous! Very intellectual!

163
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:29,900
A man held in the highest regard and --
-Just give us a name, we can Google the rest.

164
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,858
Of course...
-Yeah, what's his name? Where does he live?

165
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,628
Alastair Brook.

166
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:39,509
Come again?

167
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,259
Alastair Brook.
-Alastair Brook.

168
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,071
Don't you like it?

169
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,179
No.

170
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,689
In fact, it's lovely.

171
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,470
I guess, on that note...
-NO!

172
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,750
The only thing I'm gonna note is what your Uncle says about you.

173
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,404
Koko! Man in the house!

174
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:09,100
Ma'am?
-Throw 'em out. O-U-T!

175
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,988
Aye, get out! Out!
-Hey -- Just a sec...

176
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:16,448
C'mon...

177
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,629
C'mon!
-See you.

178
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,526
I said throw 'em out! Make sure they're outta your sights! And lock the gate!
-He's coming after us!

179
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,311
Annie...

180
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,468
Annie...?

181
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:53,308
I don't think I can find a place for us...

182
00:16:53,308 --> 00:17:01,920
By the way, I've been thinking all night... How are you gonna bring your late Uncle back from the grave?
-You don't know what Shobi can do!

183
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,410
Oh, please... Save it for that wretch Bedar Bukht! How long are you gonna take anyway?

184
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,140
Ta da!

185
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,181
What am I looking at?

186
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,020
Lenses? Doesn't it hurt?

187
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,260
A bit, but it's okay!

188
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,868
But -- Wh -- Just -- Why?

189
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,542
Could you... Tell it's me?

190
00:17:29,542 --> 00:17:34,950
No... But... You're outta your mind! Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta go take a shower!

191
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm gonna kill him!

192
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:43,270
Oi! Caught ya!

193
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,239
'Ere!

194
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,050
'Scuse me, who?

195
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,650
It's me!
-Listen, guv, I only know two blokes 'round 'ere. Two blokes who stay but don't pay. Saw them?

196
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,950
Listen, guv, I only know two blokes 'round 'ere. Two blokes who stay but don't pay. Saw them?

197
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,119
Gone.
-Eh?

198
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,250
Gone, Mr Khan!
-Really?

199
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,000
Böri... My nephew... Had an accident...

200
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,270
May his soul rest in peace...

201
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,321
Wasn't you with 'im?

202
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,700
Real bad news indeed...

203
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,630
Last time I came here, I saw this big lock...

204
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,020
Anyway, who're you?

205
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,650
His Uncle...
-For real?

206
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:40,650
Yeah... Just here to... Get his things... Clothes and all, you know... His mother's just... Crying buckets...

207
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,740
Most unfortunate... She poor?

208
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,988
Very.

209
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:50,298
Alrigh', easy there, guv... It pains to see you cryin'...

210
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,399
'Ere...

211
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,845
This is --

212
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:58,456
Back off, it ain't all yours! Get it?

213
00:18:58,456 --> 00:19:02,290
Just -- Pray for me, okay?

214
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,801
So sad... There goes all my rent...

215
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,670
Why d'you leech our money if you've got so much?

216
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,200
Grist... Why do I have to do everything here?

217
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,328
Who is it this time?

218
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,498
Let's just say someone...

219
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,930
Who takes the road...

220
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:40,020
Less travelled by...

221
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,254
The name's Brook...

222
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,690
Alastair Brook.

223
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,058
But please, call me Amadeus... All the other poets do.

224
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:52,662
Unbelievable...

225
00:19:53,430 --> 00:20:01,280
To believe, or not to believe... That is the question. But it is nobler to believe. By the way, who'd you be?

226
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,949
Naina.

227
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,289
Naina...

228
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:15,040
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly eyes.

229
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:28,610
Your name... Personality... And style...

230
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,051
They remind me of someone very close...

231
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:45,969
Be careful who you hold close... Too close and they bring you to tears...

232
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,868
How d'you know?

233
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:51,148
Elementary, my dear Naina...

234
00:20:51,148 --> 00:20:53,458
I can read everything...

235
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,948
On your face.

236
00:20:56,538 --> 00:21:05,869
Your eyes as deep as the oceans... I'd rather drown --
-Please...

237
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,110
Yeah, let's talk business.

238
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,560
I hear the boys were here yesterday.

239
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,718
Shahab and Böri.

240
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:21,419
There's only one name I remember...

241
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,450
Shahabuddin Shobi!

242
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,447
Your nephew, is he?

243
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,730
Of course...

244
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,178
More like a son, really.

245
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:40,929
That's what they all say.

246
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,857
Anyway, Madame... How much would you want in advance?

247
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:48,608
Forget it --
-Oh, lots!

248
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:52,440
Just send them... We'll sort it out with them.

249
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,450
Sort what out with them?

250
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,790
The deal for the annex.

251
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:04,548
Of course... I'll take my leave.
-I'm sure you'd be back soon?

252
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:09,188
I'm leaving a piece of myself here...

253
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:14,018
My nephew, get it? Almost like my son?

254
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,549
Good day.

255
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,033
Uncle!

256
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,143
Your phone.

257
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:31,735
Please... Call me Alastair Brook.

258
00:22:32,675 --> 00:22:35,136
Lovely name.

259
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,450
Take care.

260
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,930
Thank you.

261
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:43,694
What are you doing? Go after him, man!

262
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:47,170
Make sure he doesn't come back!

263
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,290
The same look, the same style, the same personality...

264
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,778
The same eyes...

265
00:22:56,778 --> 00:22:59,769
And the same love for poetry.

266
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,180
It's...

267
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,659
Outta this world!

268
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,399
Unbelievable!
-Annie!

269
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,260
He looked like a poor counterfeit Alastair Brook to me, the codger!

270
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,701
No...

271
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:18,776
There was something about him...

272
00:23:18,776 --> 00:23:22,999
My heart tells me there's something about him...

273
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,160
My Spidey-sense tells me there's something about him too...

274
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,878
What?

275
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,898
Well...

276
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,901
I guess we're about to find out!

277
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,790
♪ <i>My crew's all fired up!</i> ♪

278
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,190
Whoa!

279
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:53,748
What the devil?
-It's -- Just a flowerpot!

280
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:56,009
<i>Was</i> a flowerpot!

281
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:01,580
Sorry, we didn't see it...
-Go get your eyes checked!

282
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,600
Well, Miss Evensong... Why don't you just pray the Lord heals our eyes?

283
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
Why'd you say her name?

284
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,978
D'you want me to call her Koko?
-All of that later... I want this month's rent!

285
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:23,928
God knows where your Uncle disappeared after casting his poetic spells!

286
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,440
Ma'am! Glad to see you!

287
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,580
I've got something for you from Uncle Brook.
-Yeah?

288
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:41,028
He said he's gonna talk about the rent and all with you... In private.

289
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:48,799
Of course, if that's what he wants... But no worries... Who cares about the rent anyway?

290
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:55,070
Let me take care of it, byt. Okay?

291
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,431
Where's he, by the way?

292
00:24:57,431 --> 00:24:59,121
Right here.

293
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,511
Huh?

294
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:06,860
As in... Us... Or Uncle... What does it matter?
-Aye, what's it matter?

295
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,120
He'd be here tomorrow -- for lunch?
-Sure. On us.

296
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,948
Bless you!

297
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,278
Just your Uncle.

298
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:21,668
Not you two!

299
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,550
Okay. No problem.
-Okay.

300
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,525
Aww...

301
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:32,080
I'll send something for you.
-Thank you.

302
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,850
We'll get going then?

303
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,990
1 p.m.?
-12.45.

304
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,639
Yeah. Tell him, okay?

305
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,055
Koko! Show them the annex.

306
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay, ma'am... Okay, Miss Eve...

307
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,480
See you!
-Of course!

308
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,600
What's for lunch?
-Bloody poison!

309
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,291
And who broke this?
-What do I -- THEY DID, of course!

310
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,907
Psst!

311
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,410
Listen to this one, Koko...

312
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,790
You're the man here.
-I know, Eve...

313
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:30,069
So, naturally, you're watching the two suspicious men here. Especially their Uncle!

314
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:35,629
Don't worry. Crime Master Koko won't disappoint you.

315
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:41,670
Great! On your feet, soldier! Your mission impossible commences now! Good luck and Godspeed!

316
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,262
Go, Koko, Go! Whoa!

317
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,612
Whoa!

318
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,159
Lovely place...

319
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:53,218
Not bad, Naina...

320
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,981
Fully-furnished...

321
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,872
Did you see how Naina looked at you? What a cute snake!

322
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:05,982
You'd be found dead on the street if you let her bite you!

323
00:27:05,982 --> 00:27:10,533
Watch it mate... Getting this place wasn't easy!

324
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:16,184
Just pray your mate's career kickstarts! I'll build something better for you!

325
00:27:16,184 --> 00:27:19,079
Quit daydreaming!

326
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:24,310
Lying on this bed, I ain't dreaming of anything short of Cinderella!

327
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,868
Hey there, laddie!

328
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,728
Koko!

329
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,640
Come in.
-Come here, mate...

330
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,889
How d'you like the room?

331
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,568
What were you doing here?

332
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,683
Listening in on us?

333
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,000
Who d'you work for? Miss Eve?

334
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,991
Well, then, let's go see her...

335
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,849
So, Crime Master Koko... The unsuccessful Sherlock Holmes!

336
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,949
Let's meet your Watson, shall we?

337
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,897
Naina ma'am wants to see me...

338
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:18,338
Hey! Ko --

339
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,368
You got him to spy on us!

340
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,339
Why would I?

341
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:29,902
I can see it on your face.
-What other theories can you discover on it?

342
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:39,310
Quite a few, to be honest. The plain, and the mysterious, the --
-Hold it... No one wants to hear it.

343
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,728
Please, don't...

344
00:28:41,728 --> 00:28:44,390
This look suits you.

345
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,601
Behave yourself!

346
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,776
My hair, my choice!

347
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,150
Sir! Your roadie's here.

348
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,056
What a lovely feeling...

349
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:18,795
That's the tenth time you said that...

350
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:24,958
I guess 10's my lucky number... And this time, it's for real!

351
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:28,280
'Far as I remember, it was for real the seventh time too!

352
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,927
C'mon, mate! Get off! Let's go have something... It's cheat night!

353
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,877
What's up?

354
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:56,987
Just singing an Evensong... Praying...
-For?

355
00:30:57,518 --> 00:31:02,110
For something...

356
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,140
That could change a man's life...

357
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,988
I'm really sorry... I was too rude back then...

358
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,358
Really...

359
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:20,229
What if I didn't say it's okay?

360
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:23,230
You have to...

361
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,620
It ain't okay, it ain't okay, it ain't okay!

362
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,120
Shobi!

363
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,141
Not okay...

364
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:44,430
Not okay...
-Shobi! Hey!

365
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,639
Shobi! Hey!

366
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:51,110
Get up! Naina's calling your other number!
-Put a sock in it!

367
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:56,520
Here! Talk to her!
-You had to ruin my dream, didn't you? Get me some tea...

368
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,100
Sir, yes sir. Anything else, sir? Don't forget to talk to her, sir!
-Go!

369
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,789
Jesus...

370
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,978
What the actual --

371
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,600
Now we mix this...

372
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,920
No, not this... Whoops...

373
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,768
What next?

374
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:24,738
What's up, top chef?

375
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:31,595
Gee... Why'd you have to interrupt me? I was following this recipe!

376
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:33,200
But why?

377
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,690
We've got special guests for lunch... Could you help me dice this nice and small?

378
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,461
No way I'm doin' anything!

379
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:46,381
Okay, go ask Koko to clean the drawing room. I want it shining bright!

380
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,070
They don't deserve it!
-Hey!

381
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,598
Go and ask him to clean the room. I'll be checking!

382
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,188
Grist... I lost track of everything...

383
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,488
Annie!
-Ie?

384
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,330
You burnt the coq au vin!
-Good Heavens!

385
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,341
The advance. Right here. Right now.

386
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,881
Hello? Where's the advance?

387
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,250
You've got some fine manners, girl...

388
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,551
Not finer than yours.

389
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,080
Look at how you stare!

390
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:12,090
When do we get the advance? No freebies for anyone here. I need it right now -- Annie needs it! Just put the blimmin' flowers away!

391
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,618
Ow!

392
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,648
Wait until I'm through with you!

393
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,728
What's with all this salt?
-Just pray I don't poison him!

394
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:35,578
Everything ready? Aye.

395
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:42,290
C'mon, now, quickly. I'm sure he's starving!
-Just a minute!

396
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,338
Here!

397
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:51,760
Specially for you.

398
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,080
The pleasure is all mine...

399
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,710
Please, try some...
-Sure.

400
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,881
Coq au vin... Always a favourite...

401
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:04,600
I always thought you'd rather like fried brains...

402
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,701
Plaît-il, Madame?

403
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:12,402
By the way... What d'you produce at your factor<i>ies?</i>

404
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,550
I'd tell you if I could count...

405
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,760
I think I'll try the afters, Miss Naina...

406
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,930
Not just yet... You got to finish that first!

407
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,760
Or is it you don't like it?

408
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,817
No, it's fantastic... Made with love, evidently...

409
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:40,998
I won't know that until you've finished it...!

410
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,391
Before we forget... What about the rent?

411
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:55,970
You better not say anything, Annie... I've got no money and I need to go shopping!

412
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:04,910
Well, in that case... You can take my card... Get whatever you want... Anything...

413
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,880
Why are you giving me your card? I'd rather have some cash, you know.

414
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,390
The times have changed... Haven't they, Miss Naina? Who uses cash today?

415
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,908
Ie.

416
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:18,510
Password?

417
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,487
What d'you think you're doing? Give him his card back.

418
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,956
Give it back!

419
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,116
Fine!

420
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,860
Here. Don't worry about the rent... And don't worry about her... Heaven knows what's wrong with her!
-It's okay...

421
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,436
I'm sure we can work something out...

422
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,137
Uh...

423
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,385
Looks like she didn't like that!

424
00:36:50,385 --> 00:36:56,170
Forget her... She's always a bit round the twist... Please, enjoy the meal...

425
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,715
Annie's blinded by love...

426
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll have to deal with him myself... By the way, what the devil is the old devil doing in there for so long?

427
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,430
I'll have to deal with him myself... By the way, what the devil is the old devil doing in there for so long? There you are!

428
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,866
You're dead for real!

429
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,518
Where's he off to?

430
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,526
That blighter Vikram!

431
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:26,867
No luck?

432
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:33,920
He only casts his own fellas. We're strapped for cash. Gotta leave this place.
-Calm down, mate!

433
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,566
Lady Luck's on our side!

434
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,497
Where is he?

435
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,250
Where the devil is Alastair 'Amadeus' Brook? Yeah?

436
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:47,120
Hey!
-Yeah -- Where's Uncle Amadeus? -- Gone...
-Gone?

437
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,547
I just saw him come here!

438
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:53,558
Where's he hiding?
-What's wrong with you?

439
00:37:53,558 --> 00:38:03,217
I've got a problem with your Uncle! He's acting Romeo to my sister's Juliet, that blimming --

440
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,640
I'm gonna be the end of him!

441
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,795
Ever fell in love?

442
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:13,296
Eww!

443
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:16,763
Had a crush?

444
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:20,061
No.
-Bet you've got someone in your heart!

445
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,720
Bet you've got someone in your heart!
-I'm not off my head yet!

446
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,411
I'm not off my head yet!
-What makes you think you can understand what my Uncle and your Annie feel for each other?

447
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:29,000
What makes you think you can understand what my Uncle and your Annie feel for each other?

448
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,302
Wait a minute --

449
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:33,098
Don't touch me!

450
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:37,500
Okay... But... The name's Shahabuddin Shobi.

451
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,356
Shobi or a showman... You're our tenant.

452
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:45,787
Don't dream of taking over this place... Or our hearts!

453
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,262
Which reminds me...

454
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:51,760
The

455
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,130
The rent.

456
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:52,440
The rent. Right

457
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,560
The rent. Right now.

458
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,801
Don't you dare, smarty-pants!

459
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,875
What are you thinking?

460
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,894
Uncle's discussed everything with Miss Naina...

461
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:11,015
I mean -- Why are you so worried? It's not good for your health?

462
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,670
When?

463
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,364
Yeah -- Discussed -- Everything...

464
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,824
My blood's boiling --

465
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,202
My blood's boiling -- Calm down --

466
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:20,264
My blood's boiling -- Calm down -- Calm down, Eve --

467
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:21,752
My blood's boiling -- Calm down -- Calm down, Eve -- No way, I can't! Just --

468
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:24,872
My blood's boiling -- Calm down -- Calm down, Eve -- No way, I can't! Just -- SHUT UP!!!

469
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,459
Outta my way!
-Good Lord...

470
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:38,149
That 'shut up' ignited something in my heart...

471
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:43,704
She'll cut you up and feed you to the dogs!
-Don't worry, you'll be safe.
-Much appreciated.

472
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:53,260
What are you so worried about, Mr Brook? I'll take care of everything. Don't worry at all, okay?

473
00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:00,446
Alright, if you're going to Swansea... Be careful, okay? Don't drive too fast... The thought of it scares me...

474
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:02,395
Promise me...

475
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:10,053
Don't worry, I'll take care of them. They're having the coq au vin too... Take care.

476
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,443
Are we turning into Hungry House for the hungry blokes in the house?

477
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:21,930
What's your problem? He was so kind... I mean, who'd give his MAC card like that? He even told you his password!

478
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,134
I thought he nearly died that moment.
-Gotta go serve them the coq au vin...

479
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:27,242
Gotta go serve them the coq au vin...
-You ain't going anywhere, Annie...

480
00:40:27,242 --> 00:40:32,429
You ain't going anywhere, Annie...
-What's wrong with you? I'm sure they're starving! The least we can do is be kind...

481
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:36,990
They're hungry?
-Yeah, I'm sure the poor souls are starving. Lemme go...

482
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,263
Poor souls?
-Yeah, I mea -- Just lemme go!

483
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:42,645
Annie!

484
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,325
I'm dying to taste the coq au vin! And, couldn't you ask for the bouillabaisse too?

485
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,214
That all you care about?

486
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:58,140
I've got no idea how I can tell Eve how much I love her...

487
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,046
If that weren't enough, there's this blasted Naina!

488
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,966
Right here...!

489
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,583
From Alastair Brook... With love!

490
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:11,420
I thought he left for Swansea?

491
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,441
He has a place in our hearts.

492
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,372
Uhh... Just the coq au vin? I mean -- bread or, anything?

493
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:25,580
Oh, yeah, sorry... I'll ask Koko to get you what you want...

494
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:31,100
I called Mr Brook to tell him you're trying it... But his phone's switched off...

495
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,800
He'll check it any second...
-Hem hem!

496
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,850
I mean -- I'm sure he's just having issues with the signal -- On the way...?

497
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:43,482
Exactly. That's what I was thinking. You'll get what you want, don't worry.
-Thank you.

498
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:49,448
She'll make you pay for every bite if she found out, you twit!

499
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:52,624
No time. Lemme enjoy this!

500
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,178
Jesus...

501
00:41:56,879 --> 00:42:01,865
No way... I can't do it. C'mon, we're leaving...

502
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:09,675
Lemme try the coq au vin... And -- What about all the times you said, 'You don't know what Shahab can do'? I know you can do it!

503
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:13,131
You won't get it, mate --
-Just... Talk to her.

504
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:20,768
Tell her we got it... We'll sort it out later, mate... I'll go get some bread... Okay?

505
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,920
Please, don't...

506
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,883
This look suits you.

507
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,540
I know how you feel, Mr Brook...

508
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,340
I understand everything...

509
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,554
I understand your hesitation...

510
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:08,660
But, if it helps... I feel the same way...

511
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,142
And...

512
00:43:10,985 --> 00:43:14,506
You know I'm happy with it...

513
00:43:14,627 --> 00:43:20,710
I'm -- I'm texting you my sister's number... Could you send the proposal to her?

514
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,998
I can't live without you...

515
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:30,450
I understand... Uhh... I'll get back to you, Miss Naina...

516
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,131
Thank you.

517
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,565
Gotta say, the coq au vin was lovely.
-I'm tired of living this lie!

518
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:45,424
What's she saying?
-Oh, nothing...

519
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:51,030
She just wants me - that is, Alastair Brook - to send a proposal to her sister!

520
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,959
Way to go, mate!

521
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,817
Looks like we just enjoyed her wedding feast... In advance!

522
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:00,030
Shut up, I'm out of ideas!

523
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:07,300
I don't know why it's always me --
-What happened? Where are you off to?

524
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:13,060
I'm gonna throw this laptop out!
-Throw the charger too... Someone may still be able to use it!

525
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,243
Thank you. Shut up, Koko!
-What happened?

526
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:20,900
I was in the middle of this presentation when this piece of junk decided to die!

527
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,708
Just ask tech support or something... Why are you throwing it out? It's so expensive!

528
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:32,550
I can try that... Though I don't really want to... But if it didn't work, I'm not sparing this pile of junk!

529
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,359
Bye!
-Hey!

530
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,210
What're you doing? Go after her! Quick!

531
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,467
This blasted piece of junk...
-Okay...

532
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:52,064
Can't you see?
-Were you not so angry all the time, I swear, I'd only have eyes for you...!

533
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,433
She's throwing her laptop out.
-It caught COVID-19 or something?

534
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:59,800
It caught COVID-19 or something?
-No, it caught your kind of ScallyVirus! It's useless now!

535
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,360
Well, I may just have the cure...
-Are you a doctor?

536
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,620
Maybe?
-No way.

537
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,201
And if I got it working?
-I'll give you whatever you want!

538
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:09,041
I'll give you whatever you want!
-Promise?

539
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:09,930
Promise?
-Promise.

540
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,441
Promise.
-Good.

541
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,044
Charger?

542
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,000
Make sure he doesn't hack it or something!

543
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,856
Koko!

544
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,856
Get my charger from my room.
-Never knew you needed one too!

545
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,182
My laptop charger...!

546
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:30,636
Why d'you make it sound so hard?

547
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:36,436
Ooh, gotta say that's a dangerous virus...

548
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:40,641
Our hero battles it valiantly... Who's gonna win this?

549
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:41,981
The virus...

550
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:43,971
The virus... Or me?

551
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,016
What's going on?

552
00:45:48,016 --> 00:45:50,048
Hi, Miss Naina!

553
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:53,310
He's fixing it...

554
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,870
Why's your Uncle not taking my calls? Been trying for ages.
-He's busy somewhere else...

555
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,950
What?
-I mean -- He'll be here tomorrow...

556
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,411
Sure?

557
00:46:05,411 --> 00:46:06,808
200%!

558
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,458
Don't forget to tell me!

559
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:14,508
Sure... You can try calling using your landline... Just in case it's something with the signal.

560
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:20,089
Ie, why didn't I think of that? Just a sec!

561
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,340
Gotta say...

562
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,149
Someone misses him too much!

563
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,060
Back to work.

564
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,791
Okay.

565
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,407
Took you long enough!
-Here.

566
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:39,957
Okay...

567
00:46:40,456 --> 00:46:43,397
Plug it in, will you?
-Okay.

568
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,387
Come here...

569
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,737
5...
-5...

570
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:53,000
4...
-4...

571
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,460
3...
-3...

572
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,210
2...
-2...

573
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,431
You lose! It's working!

574
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:02,041
Sorry!

575
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,860
Koko...

576
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,940
Take it to my room.

577
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,957
Get ready to fulfil your end of the bargain!

578
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:15,810
You heard me. Take it to my room.

579
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,540
Thanks shobi for the help :)

580
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,358
There.

581
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,150
'My pleasure'

582
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:43,610
What do you want from me???????

583
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,810
A blessing... An Evensong

584
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,907
'Evensong'?

585
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,411
'Could you dedicate one to me?'

586
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:08,639
Think again
Ain't you asking for too much?

587
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:30,855
Who's this?

588
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,630
'As stunning'...

589
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,270
'As you're smart'...

590
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,738
'I like you'?

591
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,490
Who is it? And how dare he? I'll teach him a lesson...

592
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,056
You 'like' me, eh?

593
00:49:49,056 --> 00:49:50,267
You 'like' me, eh?
-This call cannot be completed due to insufficient balance.

594
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,347
This call cannot be completed due to insufficient balance.

595
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:54,017
Jeez!

596
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,560
I'm entrusting her to you...

597
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,530
Take care of her, okay?
-No, Hadi...

598
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,017
Annie!

599
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,567
I've got no balance but I gotta call someone...

00:50:56,901 --> 00:51:05,446
I promise you, I'll make you proud one day... Or come back the same old...

609
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:11,116
I'll call you in a sec, Mum...

610
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:16,617
Gotta say, you're quite the actor.

611
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:22,107
Those looks could kill, I swear...

612
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:28,307
Been missing me? I didn't text back...
-Call him.

613
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,858
Call your Uncle. Right now.

614
00:51:33,688 --> 00:51:35,208
Uncle?

615
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:36,779
Yeah.

616
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:42,100
Are you serious? It's so late. I'm sure he turned in, I don't want to --

617
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:46,750
No, he's up, and he just texted me something... Wanna hear it?

618
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:52,899
'You're as stunning as you're smart. I like you.'

619
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:02,969
Turns out, we'd been sleeping. Annie and I... In ignorance... Just -- What is this?

620
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,320
Lemme show you...

621
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,337
C'mon, take the call...

622
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,457
Yeah? And don't you dare lie again.

623
00:52:16,457 --> 00:52:21,927
I checked Annie's phone myself. That's Alastair Brook's number.

624
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:24,438
You're Alastair Brook, aren't you?

625
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:29,180
Aren't you? D'you feel, like, ashamed of yourself, like, ever?

626
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:35,290
D'you have any idea how much it'd hurt her? How much you've hurt her feelings? You vile snake!

627
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,160
Listen to me, Eve -- I had my reasons --
-Oh, you did?

628
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:46,398
No! Don't say anything. Ever thought how she feels for this Alastair Brook? We had enough worries without you doing any of this!

629
00:52:46,398 --> 00:52:54,830
What could we do? You wouldn't rent the house to us --
-So you can try your acting skills on us? Lie to us?

630
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,900
Do you have any idea she's actually fallen for this Alastair Brook?
-I --

631
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,000
I --
-Shut up! Just shut up!

632
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,308
I'm gonna tell Annie everything, and she's gonna kick you out!

633
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,578
You're a goner...

634
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:18,084
Just try to understand, I have no interest in him. Never was, never will be.

635
00:53:18,178 --> 00:53:25,319
One thing's for sure... I can't leave Alastair Brook -- Gee, what's wrong with you? God forbid...

636
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:30,179
The living Alastair Brook! Don't ever say that again!

637
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:35,431
Our engagement... Wedding... Honeymoon... I've planned for everything!

638
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:40,001
Just tell Dad in Toronto... I'm not gonna budge this time.

639
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:49,040
Where are you off to? Just -- Get our things, we gotta slip away sharpish!

640
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,130
Where can we go? And for how long?

641
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:59,800
You came here from Kildress. My Dad kicked me out of the house... That's when I left Devon. What're we gonna tell our families?

642
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,940
You told 'em you work at a bank...

643
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:11,110
There comes a day when you live a lie, but night falls and you gotta tell the truth. And, like it or not, the night's fallen on our lives.

644
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:19,297
So please... Don't stop me today... If I didn't tell them the truth... I don't think I will ever be able to face them.

645
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:27,170
I know you're worried. But it was my plan, and I'll fix it. Just -- Leave this place... Don't stay around here. I'll take care of everything.

646
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:33,466
What are you thinking? I say -- Forget the things, let's just slip away --
-Just go! I got this...

647
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:40,168
Whatever did you say to him? He says he'll kill himself -- Hang himself -- Jump from the roof -- Or something...

648
00:54:40,168 --> 00:54:44,638
I mean -- Yeah, we shouldn't have done it -- And we're sorry --

649
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:49,017
But d'you even know how much he --

650
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,878
I'm sure you've told Miss Naina everything?

651
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:59,360
Okay. Fair 'nuff. Could you ask her to come here? He'll tell her everything. Because he's got the courage to face his lies.

652
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,830
Tell her everything so we get kicked out again, okay?

653
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:03,123
Tell her everything so we get kicked out again, okay?
-I didn't say anything...

654
00:55:03,123 --> 00:55:04,901
I didn't say anything...

655
00:55:05,061 --> 00:55:07,920
It's no good...

656
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,650
She's --

657
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:16,480
She's head over heels for your 'Alastair Brook'... Engagement, wedding, honeymoon... She's planned everything!

658
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,710
I came here to study so we could help her forget her Alastair Brook.

659
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:26,040
Then you came in with a second Alastair Brook and ruined everything!

660
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,780
Like, seriously? You didn't say anything?

661
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,230
I can tell her if that's what you want!
-No, wait...

662
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,406
Don't worry... We'll fix this.
-Just -- How?

663
00:55:36,406 --> 00:55:42,788
Look at your lives! You're struggling to fix your own lives, what can you fix ours?

664
00:55:42,788 --> 00:55:46,159
Don't worry. We'll work something out.

665
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:48,470
Oh, please, can it.

666
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,720
I promise we'll -- Why don't you say something? -- We'll work something out...

667
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,592
We came up with this idea... We'll come up with something else...
-What, Alastair Brook the Third?

668
00:55:57,592 --> 00:56:00,180
No idea... But something...

669
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,188
What? And why should I trust liars like you two?

670
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,159
We may not have earned it... But you got to trust us this one time...

671
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:17,890
C'mon, fire up your grey cells! There must be something...

672
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,958
Shobi?

673
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:26,268
You're the only one who can come up with these kinds of things.

674
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:30,558
Idea!

675
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:33,549
She's got something! C'mon!

676
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:37,902
I know someone who can get us out of this...

677
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,230
Who?

678
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,530
The one and only...

679
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,790
The one and only... The super-rich...

680
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,278
The one and only... The super-rich... Uncle Rufus!

681
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,418
Good day, sir!

682
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,528
Good day, sir. A very good day to you...

683
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,687
'Course...

684
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,270
Admit it already...

685
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,236
You've lost to Alastair 'Amadeus' Brook.

686
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,560
Touché...

687
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,331
Rufus?

688
00:57:54,331 --> 00:57:56,100
When did you get here?

689
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,930
Romeo.

690
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,807
Rufus Romeo.

691
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:05,248
No one dares lay a finger on Naina with Rufus Romeo around.

692
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,920
Although, to be honest, I'm so disappointed.

693
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:13,620
He's no match for you. Can't believe you're playing him. What's wrong with you?

694
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,160
Ever heard anyone mention -- Whatzit? Your name?

695
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,699
Ever heard anyone mention -- Whatzit? Your name?
-Alastair --

696
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:19,499
Alastair --
-Allô?

697
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:22,670
Oui, je sais que ces fichiers sont importants.
(Yeah, I know they're important.)

698
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:24,562
Oui, ils sont prêts.
(Yeah, they're ready.)

699
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:27,582
Look, I'm a bit busy right now...

700
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:30,580
So you'll have to wait...

701
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,325
Could you deal with them?

702
00:58:33,325 --> 00:58:37,214
I don't care if their company's goin' bankrupt! Bye!

703
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:39,090
Yeah, go on.

704
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,049
The name's Alastai --
-Jiminy Cricket, these emails...

705
00:58:43,049 --> 00:58:44,210
Females?

706
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:46,617
Emails.

707
00:58:46,617 --> 00:58:49,210
You didn't even tell me!
-Uncle Rufus?

708
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:54,480
Blimey, you're actually here! I'm so happy!
-Yeah! Blimey, I'm actually here! So am I!

709
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,901
And what were you playing?

710
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:02,348
Who's this old chap, by the way? I must've missed his name -- What's up with him?

711
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,942
He bowled me over the moment he entered, that imitation swashbuckler!

712
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:12,286
I say, let's pack our things and get going... Our days here are numbered anyhow.

713
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:16,420
We can't... Not when... Eve's given me some hope...

714
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,747
Forget your Evensong... Forever!

715
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,732
And to think you almost had Naina... Until now.

716
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,295
Oh, please... Just leave me alone...

717
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,020
Done...

718
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,743
There.

719
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:50,959
Not so fast!

720
00:59:52,694 --> 00:59:54,836
Would you look at that?

721
00:59:54,993 --> 01:00:02,165
These losers can't even start their bike... And you want to start a new life with their Uncle! Seriously, what's wrong with you?

722
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:06,980
As if my life's a bike... By the way, you here to say anything nice?
-Huh?

723
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,730
'Course not, but -- You know --

724
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,470
There!

725
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,570
Big deal. Took 'em 12 kicks. I've been counting.

726
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,900
How many would it take you?

727
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,657
Full steam ahead!

728
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:18,657
Full steam ahead!
-Just look at these losers! You seriously comparing them to me? What's wrong with you?

729
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:23,820
Just look at these losers! You seriously comparing them to me? What's wrong with you?

730
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,446
Right...

731
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:30,274
But you ever thought how low I'd have to stoop for you?
-How?

732
01:00:30,274 --> 01:00:36,340
For instance... I hate how everything's got a price for you! You blimmin' huckster!

733
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,906
Hey! W --

734
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,843
What's wrong with you, mate?

735
01:00:41,843 --> 01:00:43,529
What happened?

736
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,436
Hey!

737
01:00:50,686 --> 01:00:58,527
Can't you win her heart and live up to your name, Romeo? Wonder how you win over your customers!
-What's wrong with you? That's what I'm here to learn!

738
01:00:58,527 --> 01:01:01,528
Just... Forget you're Rufus...

739
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:06,484
From now on... You're just Romeo... And she's your Juliet!

740
01:01:06,484 --> 01:01:10,360
How's that sound?
-Fascinating... Worth a shot!
-Yes!

741
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:18,846
I ain't Rufus... Just... Romeo... And she's... Juliet! Just Romeo! Not Rufus!
-Romeo, aye! Juliet! Just Romeo! Not Rufus!

742
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,308
Rufus Romeo...

743
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,618
I'm sure Alastair Brook sent it...

744
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,740
I see your eyes smile...

745
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,116
And forget my sorrows for a while...

746
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,276
Water.

747
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,606
Who sent this here?

748
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,176
Can't be anyone but your Romeo!
-Huh?

749
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,091
Hmm...

750
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,160
Alastair Brook better exit stage right today!

751
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,480
To the dickens with 'im... What d'you -- What does Uncle Rufus think of me?

752
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,573
How do I know?

753
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:30,824
Okay, what d'<i>you</i> think of me?

754
01:05:30,824 --> 01:05:32,837
You're reall --

755
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:40,020
Don't distract me! Go! Double time! Get ready for your last scene as Alastair Brook!

756
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,378
Blimey... WhAT d'YoU ThINk oF mE...

757
01:05:44,425 --> 01:05:46,312
Ie, that --

758
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:00,886
Don't you think the good chap here...

759
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:06,278
Has a thing for pulling our legs?

760
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,494
Jesus, what now?

761
01:06:11,494 --> 01:06:13,029
'Allo?

762
01:06:13,705 --> 01:06:19,241
Not again! Daan't ask me why I daan't loike ter be wif ya...

763
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:25,660
As your 'usband, Beca... I order ya ter sha sum respect for your co-wife!

764
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:28,561
I'll explain it ter me girl Catrin when I'm 'ome...

765
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:29,751
Bye!

766
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,568
Cheese and Rice...

767
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,010
So, Uncle... You've got two wives?

768
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,364
No...

769
01:06:38,364 --> 01:06:41,240
Three, actually...
-Three!?

770
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:47,410
Aye... Had to kick poor Mari out... She broke me love Beca's leg in a fit of rage...

771
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:49,060
What it is is...

772
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,845
I'm looking for someone...

773
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:54,253
To replace Mari...

774
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:58,470
Alastair -- You've got -- Two wives -- <i>Two</i> - and you didn't even tell me!

775
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:02,194
Sorry, I think he said three... Yes?

776
01:07:02,194 --> 01:07:06,227
Y -- You never asked...

777
01:07:06,227 --> 01:07:09,092
Big mistake. Get up. Out!

778
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:12,790
Annie! How 'bout we sort this out after lunch?
-Shut up!
-Yeah, get out!

779
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,750
Out! Kick him out already!
-No one takes my Naina for a ride!
-But -- Lunch?

780
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:20,700
You blasted cheat! You dare romance me when you've got two or three wives?

781
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,570
Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Get out!
-Don't let the door hit you where the good Lord split you!

782
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:28,500
And you dare come here for lunch?
-Bu -- Miss Naina!
-Throw him out!

783
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,812
See you not, Uncle!

784
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:34,589
Are you okay, Annie?

785
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:37,620
You think I'm okay? Do I look okay?

786
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,240
I'm sorry!
-Well, as they say...

787
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,401
Like a ghost from the days past...

788
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:47,865
Lovely!
-That wretched man --

789
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:52,946
Left me --
-Ie, that wretch! That wicked wretch!
-That treacherous wretch...
-Annie!

790
01:07:52,946 --> 01:07:54,899
How could you do that?

791
01:07:54,899 --> 01:08:01,100
I've heard girls need a shoulder in moments like these...

792
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,645
And Romeos never miss the chance!

793
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:11,458
So -- I think I should get going... By the way... I look alright, don't I? Thank you!
-Yes! Of course! The best! All the best!

794
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:17,046
Dyw, what a mess...

795
01:08:17,046 --> 01:08:23,801
Tad didn't like the first Alastair Brook... And the second turned out to be second-rate!

796
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:26,249
Dreadful luck...

797
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:30,395
Why d'you always dial the wrong number?
-No idea...

798
01:08:30,395 --> 01:08:33,380
Look at me...
-And?

799
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:39,545
Not like that... It's a bit embarrassing... I just mean --

800
01:08:39,545 --> 01:08:41,608
You've...

801
01:08:41,608 --> 01:08:43,140
Always got me...

802
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,610
I'm all yours.

803
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:45,913
There!

804
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:49,500
Your phone... Something about your business... Innit?
-Aye. Aye.

805
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:57,818
Meetings, business deals, tours... You're always chasing money! You've got no time for anything else, have you?

806
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,665
What about that deal? That meeting you just missed?

807
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:07,621
Look, I ain't to blame if you lost something just now!

808
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:08,921
You are --
-There! Knew it!

809
01:09:08,921 --> 01:09:10,311
There! Knew it!
-You're not!

810
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:12,217
Of course you're not...

811
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:18,176
And -- I ain't just chasing money... I've been chasing this lady -- My lady... For ages...
-Of course!

812
01:09:18,176 --> 01:09:21,741
But I don't know why you don't even look at me...

813
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:25,165
I've waited for you all my life...

814
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,421
I've loved you...

815
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:32,144
Every moment of my life...

816
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:35,174
Just you...

817
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,870
I've got everything, but the only thing I ever prayed for...

818
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:43,816
Is you...

819
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,485
You're the only thing I can't lose.

820
01:09:47,964 --> 01:09:50,010
You can ask Eve...

821
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:55,620
How I felt...

822
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:58,810
When she told me about this cheat Alastair Brook...

823
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:01,324
That's why I left everything...

824
01:10:01,324 --> 01:10:03,692
And came here...

825
01:10:04,379 --> 01:10:06,970
I'm not going anywhere...

826
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,978
Not this time...

827
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:11,580
Not until I've got you...

828
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,951
Naina...

829
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:17,610
Behind Rufus...

830
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:20,577
Awaits your Romeo.

831
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,780
He pleades you...

832
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,970
To be his Juliet...

833
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:31,626
Please?

834
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:00,000
Really?

835
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,426
Really.

836
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:10,144
One less mess in the world...

837
01:11:10,144 --> 01:11:12,050
Juliet...

838
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,985
And her Romeo...

839
01:11:13,985 --> 01:11:16,978
Get their happy ending this time...

840
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:28,666
Alastair Brook's gone for good! Good riddance, I say!

841
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:32,785
Mr Rufus Romeo's arranging the funeral...

842
01:11:32,785 --> 01:11:36,810
By the way, this -- Whatzit -- Rufus -- Romeo -- Whatever...

843
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:44,160
He's a tough one, for real... He better not be the end of my love story...

844
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,686
Don't you always say, 'You don't know what I can do'? Well, show me, Shobi!

845
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,268
Now you're suckin' diesel.

846
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,996
Stand up!

847
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,633
Hands up!

848
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,070
Actually -- Hands down...

849
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:10,956
So... Which one of you is Shahab, a.k.a. Shobi?

850
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,460
It's him!
-Me?

851
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:14,990
Aye.
-Aye... It's me...

852
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:19,310
Knew it. And who's Siggeir, a.k.a. Böri?

853
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:22,677
It's him, obviously... I mean, who else've got here?

854
01:12:23,155 --> 01:12:26,330
You're Siggeir... And Böri?

855
01:12:26,330 --> 01:12:28,487
Yeah.
-Ooh, impressive.

856
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:30,856
Knew it. But you know the drill...

857
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,748
CitizenCards! I wanna see yours!

858
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,163
What's wrong with you, guys?

859
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:41,390
This is only the beginning...

860
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,301
7 p.m....

861
01:12:43,301 --> 01:12:45,970
I want 50k rent...

862
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,700
And 50k advance... Which makes...

863
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,292
50... 50... 100k...

864
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:57,068
Aye, knew it. I was just testin' you. I want 100k, okay?

865
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,001
He's paying. Yeah, he is...

866
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:04,107
Aye, because...

867
01:13:04,107 --> 01:13:04,330
Aye, because... W --

868
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:06,430
Aye, because... W -- Why not?

869
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,790
But I'd need some time --
-Not much, really...

870
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah, gotta go to the ATM and get the money...

871
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,006
How cute!

872
01:13:17,132 --> 01:13:20,760
I give your cute and calamitous selves...

873
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:25,402
Until 7 p.m. today... And your time starts...

874
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:27,473
Until 7 p.m. today... And your time starts... NOW!

875
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:34,626
Why'd you have to call that blasted Romeo?
-As if I knew he's gonna be our doom!

876
01:13:34,626 --> 01:13:38,296
Here's a tip. Sell your kidney. Problem solved!

877
01:13:38,296 --> 01:13:40,188
Shut up!

878
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,599
I swear, I'd curse this place and leave... If I didn't love Eve so much!

879
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:49,706
They're gonna curse us and kick us out if we don't pay the rent!

880
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,791
Eve sent this for you...

881
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,434
Okay...

882
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,855
What's this?
-How cute...

883
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:06,028
Can't be a love letter... Not in this day and age...

884
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:20,876
What is so urgent that you...

885
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:34,011
Ie... You needed some money... I thought I'd lend a hand...

886
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:38,643
Pitying me now, eh?

887
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:44,106
Thought you could buy me with this...?

888
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:50,126
Look, Annie's gonna kick you out for real if she didn't get the rent...

889
01:14:50,421 --> 01:14:53,625
I'm sorry, but I can't take this...

890
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:57,215
And I'm sorry, but you've got to take it!

891
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,380
I love you...

892
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,996
C'mon... I got everything...

893
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,520
Get up, boyo!

894
01:16:14,614 --> 01:16:20,043
By the way, when'd you become so upright? Returned 50k in a second!

895
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,021
I...

896
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:24,037
Couldn't take it...

897
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,584
I felt...

898
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:27,302
I should give it back...

899
01:16:27,302 --> 01:16:30,480
On the bright side, I scored some brownie points for being upright...

900
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,035
And? Eve can't be yours now. Congratulations.

901
01:16:34,035 --> 01:16:37,270
C'mon, get your things, and let's get going... Just forget her...

902
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:39,619
I can't, mate...

903
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,532
I just can't forget her...

904
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:48,592
The final act played out like a proper tragedy...

905
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,670
I even thought...

906
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:56,165
I'd give up on acting and take up a job at Dad's factory for her...

907
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:58,179
What's wrong with you?

908
01:16:58,179 --> 01:17:01,120
Couldn't you find anyone other than this blimmin' actor?

909
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,670
As if she could find anyone other than a second-rate counterfeit copy of her fiancé!

910
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:08,900
Look where it got me. You wanna end up like me?

911
01:17:09,028 --> 01:17:11,177
He didn't really deserve you though...

912
01:17:11,177 --> 01:17:15,460
Aye... No one deserves Naina...

913
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,756
More... Than her Romeo...

914
01:17:17,756 --> 01:17:20,621
But he's a good lad.

915
01:17:20,621 --> 01:17:21,770
I mean --

916
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,034
So upright...

917
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,125
As in?

918
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:28,817
As in...

919
01:17:28,817 --> 01:17:33,361
I could see right through his disguise...

920
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:40,321
I told Naina right away... But we thought we'd wait... Enjoy the show until the curtain fell...

921
01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:43,258
What? <i>You</i>?

922
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,270
What? <i>You</i>?
-Yeah, just like you... I mean -- You were interested in him and you didn't even tell me!

923
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:48,486
Yeah, just like you... I mean -- You were interested in him and you didn't even tell me!

924
01:17:48,486 --> 01:17:58,003
And -- It ain't your fault... I mean, he's a nice lad... From a decent family... He's done an MBA too... It's just -- This thing he's got for acting that's in his way --

925
01:17:58,003 --> 01:18:03,297
I can work on that! You just gotta convince Tad-cu and Mam!

926
01:18:03,297 --> 01:18:05,480
Don't worry. I can work on it too.

927
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,866
I know what you're so excited about...

928
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:12,320
Grist, can we talk about me first?

929
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:17,240
Can't hurt if we got married the same day as you, can it?

930
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,510
Lovely...

931
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:25,677
Gotta say... That was one lovely performance!

932
01:18:25,677 --> 01:18:27,703
I'm impressed!

933
01:18:27,754 --> 01:18:31,160
Shows the lengths you can go to for Eve.

934
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:38,725
Huh?

935
01:18:38,725 --> 01:18:46,705
Don't try something smart... I wanna see your parents - your <i>real</i> parents - for real this time... If you want to make her yours!

936
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,828
And...

937
01:18:51,828 --> 01:18:57,077
You can stay here as long as you like... Without caring about the rent...

938
01:18:57,077 --> 01:19:04,814
But if I heard you're bothering her... Or I see her crying because of you... You know it ain't gonna be good for you!

939
01:19:04,814 --> 01:19:07,494
Of course... I promise...

940
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:12,443
You'll have no complaints... Don't worry...
-Aye, no complaints!

941
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:22,690
Anyway, mate... I'm knackered... Gotta go get some rest...

942
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,371
Nighty night!

943
01:19:28,290 --> 01:19:29,435
Uhh...

944
01:19:29,435 --> 01:19:30,590
Uhh?

945
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:34,034
I'll get going...
-Aye... Okay...

946
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,614
By the way...
-Ie?

947
01:19:35,614 --> 01:19:38,803
Nothing... Nothing, really!

948
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,562
Okay...
-Umm...

949
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,651
'Night!

950
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
