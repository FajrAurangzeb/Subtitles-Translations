1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
foo

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you doing here? Got a job here?
-Hey...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I'm designing a set for them...

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, see you.
-Good luck.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna kill you!
-Calm down...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down my foot! I can live as your 'wife', but I can't take an attack on my credibility! They say I've stolen the design!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pay you for it...
-Oh you will? Really?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna kill you for real! You blasted cheat! I don't wanna see you again, Shahrukh!
-Hey! Easy! Calm down!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good day... You're the Sarge, yes?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew it when I saw you!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're Shahrukh's parents.
-And I'm his landlord.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, come in...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll be here in a sec...

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear the royal 'they'? He respects his tenant, I tell you!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shahrukh never mentioned you.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't need to... I mean, everyone's got parents...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright?
-Well...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shahrukh's getting engaged... So we thought we'd come here...

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in... He's marrying a second?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a professor... I forget some things... But I sure as anything can't forget my son's marriage!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean? He's married someone here?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Haven't you seen his wife? Although, to be honest...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen her either...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you so sure if you've never seen her?
-Aye.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She likes to cover up so much... I doubt even Shahrukh's seen her!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shahrukh!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you see who's here? Mum and Dad!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've told me...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... So you could hide your wife somewhere!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?
-You didn't tell them you got married?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's talk in my room?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First... Is it true? You married here?
-Yeah?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Married...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...
-Outta here...
-But Dad! Wait!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never forgive him if he were my son, but... It's up to you...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never forgiving him!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --
-Your Dad is so upright!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dunno about your Mum, but...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, never...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless her too... Your parents are so upright! How could you even think of it?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't! I -- Let's talk in my room, shall we?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, we're outta here!
-Let's hear him out...
-Wait -- Dad!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. What've you got?

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No good, sir... If he had the guts, he wouldn't have hidden it in the first place...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... We're practically forcing you to say it because we dropped in!

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, no point in listening to such a treacherous son...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, right...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's betrayed us... Broken our trust...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no use... Come!

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Dad! Wait! Mum! Lemme explain! Just gimme a minute!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Outta my way!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such respect for your dad! Lovely jubly!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Learn summit from 'im.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was it, Dad?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blighter Mahruk -- Shahrukh's parents... They didn't even know he's married!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder if his wife's in the dark too...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's who he's married, genius!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shahrukh!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't you too happy?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it's because you've met Mum and Dad?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How d'you know he's happy?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scientifically speaking... A quiet man is happy... But a quiet woman isn't.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A Sarge may retire from the force... But never from suspecting others!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always had a feeling your Mum and Dad don't know you're married!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sources of journalists... And the informants of the force... Are always classified...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're low on brains. Get a drip ASAP.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your Glucose?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We had a domestic... She went to her parents'...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Dad, wife... That's three people you angered in one day! Way to go, mate!

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A very productive day, if you ask me!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Productive? How -- ?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got it.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to stay here with your wife... So come back... When she's back!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I'm gonna need some time...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scientifically sp --
-The question ain't scientific. Wives ain't scientific.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a tip. Take your wife to a mall. Anywhere you find a sale... Get her what she wants, and her anger's gonna cool down for half off.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, Dad... As a retired husband... Why don't you give him some tips?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think this is Wives 101?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get going.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were to stay here with your wife. Come back with her and I'll let you in. Get going!
-But -- She -- Wait! Sir -- Hey!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Glucose, boyo! What's wrong with you?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You proved me a cheat! Ain't that enough?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anoushay gave me her number for it, mate! Thanks to you, my love story's gonna reach its happy end! You're my hero!

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, can it... You know, a cop would be a better friend than you. You'd lose 99 times but gain something the 100th time.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's stretching it... You'd gain more than a few times with me... Anyway... Shall we?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't wanna live with you.
-What've you got? This road?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Sarge won't let me in without you...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take your blimmin' veil!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm off!
-But where?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!
-Not cricket!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head? Look -- Even the car --

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just started!

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, that's some real ego! Well then! Have it your way! Get lost! Besides, who's gonna know who's behind the veil?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jaysus...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got something for me? Give it away in the Lord's name... He'd bless you!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like He just did!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder what you mean.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can give you lots. Good food. As long as you do one thing...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's wot they aw say... I daan't trust them na...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm different... Just -- Put this veil on and come with me...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean? I don't get it...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wot do ya mean? I daan't get it...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to... Just put this on...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wot 're ya doin'?
-Just put it on!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why? Geroff me! 'Ey!
-Just put it on... And come with me!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why daan't ya put it on yourself? Blimmin' idiot!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me Hammer and Tack me Syrup of Fig! Curse ya!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gimme the veil!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say... Lovely gathering...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's Katie thinking?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder how we can get a look at his wife...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me too...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not cricket! How can you think what I'm thinking? Back to your own thoughts!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard she's a bit 'round the twist... Always washing her face!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you care? You're a bit 'round the twist too...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got an idea.
-Yeah?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pull her veil off the moment she steps in.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unveil every secret!

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's she, by the way?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had a domestic and left... And Shahrukh's gone to make up to her.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's Shahrukh?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Anoushay... You don't pay attention to anything, do you?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- She doesn't even know our tenant's name!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Christ knows what she's so busy with...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the surprise about? He's our new tenant.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- I saw someone else in the morning!

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you saw his friend. He's here sometimes.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His wife's always in her veil by the way. You saw her?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's married?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried my best, Sarge... But... She won't listen...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't just try... You gotta beg!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you want to control her... Say you're marrying someone else!

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll do as you say!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried, but she won't cover up!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I expected better.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What, having fewer rows?
-No.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a wise girl right in front of you, but you won't even ask her!

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. Allow me.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant me...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
