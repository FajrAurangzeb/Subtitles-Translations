1
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,045
Jaysus, this alarm!

2
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:39,264
Get up, Shahrukh!

3
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,921
Jaysus, not again!

4
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,751
Where's the blasted button?

5
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:03,498
Everyone's gonna get up except you!

6
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,949
Shahrukh!

7
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,954
Get up, Shahrukh!

8
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:11,986
Get up already!

9
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:13,938
This ain't gonna work...

10
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,366
Wait. I know what to do...
-Just a couple more minutes...

11
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:26,511
Get up right now, or you know there's gonna be floodin' here!
-Don't -- Don't!

12
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,991
Why do you have to set so many alarms?

13
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,671
9.30 already? Jeez... First day at the office and I'm late! What's the boss gonna do?

14
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,651
Mind your step!

15
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,436
My car!

16
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,526
My car! Shahrukh!

17
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:14,150
Shahrukh! No --!

18
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,084
It's my car you're -- Jaysus!

19
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,134
Shahrukh, you bugger!

20
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:25,240
We ought to kick these two out. Proper pain in the neck, these two...

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,390
About chuffin' time.

22
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,061
Help me, O God! May I not lose another job!

23
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,755
He had the nerve to take my car!

24
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,563
Yeah, Glucose?

25
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:19,895
I know you took my car! You know I had a meeting!

26
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:23,560
Can't you let your friend borrow it? I ain't asking for your life or something!

27
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,220
Well that's because you've already taken it! And - what nerve! Not even sorry!

28
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:34,476
No thank yous and no sorries in friendship, just -- Hey!

29
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,904
Glucose...

30
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,500
I had a teeny tiny accident...

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,063
An accident! It's my car, you moron!

32
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:56,223
It's all your fault! Calling me when I'm driving!

33
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,227
But -- Shahrukh!

34
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,443
It's a woman!

35
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,837
Just a minute.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,915
Out.

37
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,040
What've I done?

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,241
I didn't do it.

39
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:17,534
What do you mean? Can't you see my car here? You bumped in and broke the bumper!

40
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:21,583
The bumper...

41
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,568
What about my car?

42
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:29,628
Well, ma'am... Can't you see your car's parked right in the middle of the road?
-Hello?

43
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:33,397
Are you out of your mind? Can't you see the stop light?

44
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,207
What stop light?

45
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:39,090
To the Devil with her! Get back to me!

46
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,136
Alright, let's not block the traffic. Pull over. We can talk.

47
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,251
Come.

48
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:49,861
To the left.

49
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,027
No idea why women have to drive at all!

50
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,257
I'll be waiting!

51
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,236
You messed with the wrong woman!

52
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:04,502
Yeah, Glucose --
-What the devil do you think you're doing?

53
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,460
Calm down.

54
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,440
I've only got one car!
-Mind your glucose. It's her car that took the blow. Not yours.

55
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,016
You're in for it! I'll be waiting!

56
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,745
Jeez... I'm so late...

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,491
C'mon...

58
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:39,639
Where'd she come from?

59
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,410
I'm a gonner...

60
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,243
Where could she be going?

61
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,036
Where's my lift? C'mon, now...

62
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,739
Excuse me...

63
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,888
Excuse me?

64
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,867
Mam...

65
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,120
My heart's-a-skippin' a beat!

66
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,253
That lift doesn't work...

67
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:51,421
Use this one.

68
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,139
Excuse me...

69
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,410
Good morning.

70
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,703
I'm Shahrukh.

71
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:20,645
The man from the stairs?

72
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:21,969
Yes...

73
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,436
It's my first day.

74
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,409
Being punctual, are we?

75
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,616
Mr Abbas asked about you...

76
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,534
That's one of three. Three hits and you're out.

77
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:36,410
I'd already drafted your termination letter.

78
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm so sorry... I work hard. I'm ready to put my heart into it.

79
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,160
Good... Just hold on to your heart, okay? Don't lose it to someone here. Mr Abbas can be very strict.

80
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,540
What do you mean?

81
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,050
I'm telling you because you're good at heart. Mr Abbas doesn't like flirts.

82
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,520
Is he something of a heart-throb? Mr Abbas, I mean.

83
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,533
He doesn't like flirts in his office.

84
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:08,632
Consider yourself kicked out the day he saw you with a woman or the day one of them complained to him.

85
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:16,973
What's with all these restrictions? You all single?

86
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,726
How'd you guess?

87
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,080
He's meeting a director right now. Wait here until he's done.

88
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,941
Fair enough...

89
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,900
Komal...

90
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:45,948
We need these submitted ASAP, okay?

91
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,591
Why didn't she say anything to me?

92
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,241
You bet she complained about you, Shahrukh!

93
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:20,740
No, you're talking to a kid born yesterday. Of course I know! And how much more do I have to wait?

94
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,980
I know the kind of blue I want! Yeah -- Hold on for a moment... Yeah?

95
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,465
I wanted to show you these options, sir...
-And they're telling me you haven't even sent them the options!

96
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:41,982
I had a small accident on the way... That's why I got late. I was about to send the options, but I wanted to show you first.
-Go on.

97
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,670
Yeah, how much is it? No way I'm paying you that much!

98
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,740
We know many others who'd do it for much less!

99
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,422
You?

100
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:03,691
What are you doing here?

101
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,050
I --

102
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,008
Mr Abbas asked for you again. Double time!

103
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,556
Hey!

104
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:24,016
What are you doing? It's expensive.

105
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,868
Don't touch anything.

106
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:40,765
Sir... I -- Sorry...
-Well, nice to meet you, Mr Sorry! Lovely name. Easy for you to introduce yourself and apologise in one breath!

107
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:48,447
I'm Shahrukh, sir... And I'm sorry... I mean -- It was a mistake, the accident...

108
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:55,062
You had an accident too? Guess what, the lady just now had one too. World Accident Day, is it?

109
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:58,800
What about the programme?
-Yeah, about that...

110
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,305
Hey! Who asked you to sit? Right... Go on.

111
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,236
Komal...

112
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:25,750
Yeah?

113
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,820
Who's the bloke seeing Mr Abbas?

114
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,053
New associate producer. It's his first day.

115
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,523
Last day, more like.

116
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,548
What do you mean?

117
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,784
Jeez...

118
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:49,690
Let me know when he's back. I'll tell Mr Abbas all about him!

119
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,890
He's got a heart of gold...

120
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,853
Aww, sweet li'l Komal...

121
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:04,774
All that glitters is not gold.

122
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,664
Get it?

123
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,986
Hey!

124
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,515
I'm helping you because you're nice.

125
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:35,884
No, thank you.

126
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,996
I don't need any money.

127
00:12:37,996 --> 00:12:40,680
Not that sort of help!
-So?

128
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,020
You've lost this job. Find another one.

129
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,017
But why?

130
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,230
Did the bossman approve the termination letter?

131
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,186
Not yet. But it won't be long.

132
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:55,810
Because Anoushay's gonna complain and get you kicked out.

133
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,851
Anoushay?

134
00:12:56,851 --> 00:13:00,555
You hit her car, remember?

135
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:04,220
I'm helping you because I like you.

136
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,553
Do something about Anoushay, before she... You know...

137
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,241
Thank you for telling me.

138
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,034
You're nice.

139
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,383
Yeah...

140
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,603
But I don't let the lads know...

141
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:33,461
But... Now that you know, I'm not really hiding it from you...

142
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,681
All out of ideas...

143
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,250
That nasty cur!

144
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,361
Let's see...

145
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,410
Good morning...

146
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,264
Shahrukh.

147
00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:02,910
Just in case you didn't know, you ruined my day! Hit my car and ran away, but oh dear God, you have the nerve to come and stand here shamelessly --

148
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,228
I can grab a pew if you ask.

149
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
I wanted to say...

150
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,865
It's all my fault. I'm really sorry.

151
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:13,398
All your fault?

152
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:14,321
Yes.

153
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,340
Good.

154
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,788
So you accidentally hit my car?

155
00:15:18,788 --> 00:15:19,446
Of course.

156
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,970
And you just accidentally blurted out that I can't drive?

157
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,820
Of course.

158
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,870
Mhm hmm... And I suppose you just accidentally ran away sharpish?

159
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,680
Of course...

160
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,138
You got a job here accidentally too, yes?
-No. Not the job.

161
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:38,160
But I'm ready to pay you back for your losses.

162
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,410
All my fault, I'm really sorry. I shouldn't even be on the road when you're driving.

163
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,864
What do you mean?

164
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:45,610
I mean...

165
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,555
I'll pay for the repairs... Every single penny.

166
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:50,854
Good.

167
00:15:50,854 --> 00:15:55,910
I say, take this pencil and note it here...

168
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,665
Right...
Just a minute... Please record it.

169
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,955
On my phone?

170
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,914
Go on.

171
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:12,152
Rear bumper... Okay?

172
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,932
Backlights - original.

173
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,180
And indicators - original... And...
-Hold on...

174
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,940
They didn't look original?

175
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,250
Oh they didn't?
-Nope.

176
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,945
Fair enough...

177
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:29,830
So they didn't...
-A cuppa for me too, please...
-I'm calling Mr Abbas.
-Why?

178
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,980
I want to ask him if they were original.

179
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,405
Of course they were original! I saw them!

180
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:40,064
And?

181
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:41,810
Oiling.

182
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,950
Wait... What's that got to do with this accident?

183
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,454
Oh, yeah... What's that got to do with the accident?
-Yeah.

184
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:51,470
It's got nothing to do with it, yes?
-Yes.

185
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,300
Okay.
-Where are you off to?

186
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:00,270
Going to ask Mr Abbas if it's --
-Got everything to do with the accident! Of course!

187
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,012
Sit.

188
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,929
Jesus...

189
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,294
Fill up the car.
-Hey --

190
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,320
Fill up the car?

191
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,556
But you drive to work everyday!

192
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:18,616
Yeah, I don't normally need it... But then I don't normally chase a wazzock around town either!

193
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:26,466
And don't you dare think I'm saying any of it because I can't get it myself. I have the money.

194
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,750
I just want you to learn your lesson.

195
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay.

196
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,224
Get it all fixed by tomorrow, or Mr Abbas will be fixing you.

197
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:38,193
Don't worry, I --
-Okay, goodbye.

198
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:40,403
Thank you.

199
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,116
I know...

200
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:11,561
It's harder to earn a place in flat share than in someone's heart...

201
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:18,328
We're looking for a place... We'll move out as soon as we've found one.
-So very kind of you, sirs, so very kind.

202
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,938
Anytime, mate.

203
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:29,865
And -- I needed some -- to get the car repaired...

204
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:33,214
Who've I got except you?

205
00:18:33,214 --> 00:18:36,784
I'll pay you back in three days, when I've got my paycheck.

206
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:40,810
Shahrukh, you blimmin' prat! I'll kill you!

207
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,830
Outta my way!

208
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:52,000
You blimmin' hit my car!
-That's what I was talking to them about! Money to get your car fixed!

209
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,246
Get my car fixed?

210
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:55,446
Of course.

211
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:56,580
Really?

212
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,631
Really. I'll return it once I've got my paycheck.

213
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,983
Here.

214
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:14,278
Kamal... Ghafoor... Give him what he wants... He's a good kid, I assure you, he'll pay you back.

215
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,648
Yeah I'll give it back when I've got my paycheck.

216
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,288
Jeez...

217
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:26,180
C'mon, mate, at least 2,000? You know how it is these days...

218
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,251
Ghafoor...?

219
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:31,929
Robbin' us of our peace and now our money!

220
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,630
Thank you.

221
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,050
Now you better get my car fixed!

222
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,060
Of course, mate.

223
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,430
I...

224
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,436
I don't know how I'll be able to return this favour...
-Well, return the money, for starters.

225
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,006
100% fixed. In perfect condition.

226
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,722
Happy?

227
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,516
About what?

228
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,748
You just paid for what you damaged.

229
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:05,045
No... I mean... Let's end this crossness between us, okay?
-Excuse me!

230
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:10,250
What are you talking about? Who do you think you are that I'd even be cross with you?

231
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,796
Go. I'm busy.

232
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,070
A special offer from the mechanic. Free repairs if anything goes wrong before tomorrow evening.

233
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,939
Lovely.

234
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:25,824
So... If you could just give me your number...

235
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:30,467
I can give it to the mechanic.

236
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Wait... So you don't remember your own number?

237
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Yeah... Shame I never had to call myself.

238
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,685
Oh...

239
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,481
Yep, I was right...
-Here...

240
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,826
Please type here.

241
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,953
Here.
-Please save it.

242
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:58,720
Can you read? Good, can you use a phone? Know my name?
-Of course.

243
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,461
Save it, then!

244
00:21:02,851 --> 00:21:04,627
Get going!

245
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,120
Cheap! Cheap cad!

246
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,434
Hello?
-Yeah, Komal...

247
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:23,308
I've given your number to the mechanic. Let me know if he calls.

248
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:24,358
Okay.

249
00:21:24,358 --> 00:21:26,133
Thank you.

250
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,055
You git! Why didn't you get the car fixed?

251
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:59,920
I did... Got the car I hit fixed... Or she would've had me kicked out of the job!

252
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,355
You took the money from us to get <i>her</i> car fixed?</i>

253
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:14,216
I told you! I mean -- Just look at his face! Can you read the blasted 'Danger Ahead' sign?

254
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:18,538
The landlord says he's kickin' us out if we didn't kick youse twos out!

255
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,197
Why didn't you come with me to see the new flat?

256
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:32,946
My dear mates... It won't be the end of the world if we spent another day here!

257
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,861
Who are you calling?

258
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,003
Someone from the office... Need to talk to her about the project...

259
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:04,104
Let me guess... It's her car you hit.

260
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,340
No secrets from you... She's gonna be your sister-in-law!

261
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,458
Okay... But tell her it was my car that hit her!

262
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,390
Of course!
-Also tell her we're about to get kicked out of our flat!

263
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,920
Ringing...

264
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,255
What d'you expect? The phone ain't gonna start talking to you, I mean!

265
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,807
Hello? Who is it?
-Hello...

266
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,480
Hi...

267
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,050
It's...

268
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,213
It's... Shahrukh.

269
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:31,140
The car accident... Remember?

270
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,961
Yeah, I get it, Shahrukh. How are you, handsome?

271
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:36,739
'Handsome'?

272
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:40,576
What was that?

273
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,844
That --

274
00:23:41,844 --> 00:23:44,114
Was my heart speaking out...

275
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:50,364
I mean -- An echo from my empty heart... An echo, yeah...

276
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:55,910
Wow... You're so romantic! Just like me!

277
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,827
I can hear the echoes from here...

278
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,350
So... I hope you had no trouble with the car?

279
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,691
What car?

280
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,730
Jeez... You gonna talk about the car again?

281
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,970
Yeah... I thought I'd bring it up... Get this show on the road, you know...

282
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,800
So... Why'd you call?

283
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,456
I wanted to tell you that...

284
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:30,270
You...

285
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,688
You've got a lovely smile...

286
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:36,750
So don't be angry again, okay?

287
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,605
Really?

288
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:46,919
And... You've got beautiful eyes...
-Sweet Mary, never knew Dr Shahrukh was an eye specialist!
-Shut up!

289
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,601
Who was that?

290
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:51,790
No... No one really...

291
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,670
It's the telly!

292
00:24:53,670 --> 00:25:04,000
We interrupt this programme for a special news bulletin... Love is in the air this time of the year because of a shortage of eye specialists. You're watching Geo News.

293
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,553
Wha --? Hello?

294
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:09,413
What is going on?

295
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:13,281
Nothing... Nothing at all...

296
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:20,920
Something going on in the nearby apartment... Maybe something there?

297
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,050
Where are you?

298
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,620
On the terrace... Want me to video call you?

299
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,769
Actually no... The signal's weak...

300
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,547
The signal's weak...

301
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,870
So...

302
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,239
How's everything? Wh -- What's your dream?

303
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:44,610
My dream... Well... I want my Prince Charming to propose to me with a nice, lovely flower...

304
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,556
Wow...

305
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,550
How innocent...

306
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,143
Well you may've just found him!

307
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,794
A bit weird, yeah...

308
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:14,610
But I just want Anoushay to know her dream man's here...

309
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,977
Anoushay... I love you!

310
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,630
What are you looking at?

311
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,574
N -- Nothing...

312
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,484
What are you looking at?

313
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,943
You want to keep this job or not?
-Get going quick, Shahrukh! Before Mr Abbas sees you!

314
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,670
How does His Royal Highness look?

315
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:52,000
Jesus, mate... I mean -- Your first impression wasn't even so bad that you...

316
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,205
But you said you'd like it if...

317
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:58,780
If a clown came in like that?

318
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,160
No way!

319
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,440
Goodness, women these days! Going back on their word so quick...

320
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,690
You said it's your dream that your Prince Charming propose to you with a flower...

321
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,200
Hello? What are you high on?

322
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,561
Get going, bro... I'm busy.

323
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,720
Blimey, that's some fury... 'Bro'!

324
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:28,900
What's next? You gonna say you never said anything about the prince and the flower?
-I didn't. Please, get going!

325
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,180
Okay.

326
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,820
Give it to someone else.

327
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,910
I thought the days of the Monarchy were long gone!
-Well --

328
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,979
In any case, I wouldn't want to let go of a chance to serve Your Royal Highness!

329
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,500
Please, come to my room.

330
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,740
Blimmin' Clown Prince of Clotland.

331
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,700
Pray leave.

332
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,900
What did he say?

333
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,540
Offered his seat as my throne. I said I can't imagine my boss out of this job.

334
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,400
He gave me the first warning.

335
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,280
It's your last warning!

336
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,590
You'll be out of this job if anything happened now.

337
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,960
Come here!

338
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,251
Where are you?

339
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:08,678
We had to go see the flat, remember?

340
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:13,942
What's up? You look worried.

341
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,066
Never mind...

342
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,798
Barely saved my job...

343
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,153
Not sure how long you can keep at this trade... Seems you're more after the maid!

344
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:28,610
By the way... They won't keep us any longer.

345
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,160
Tomorrow. Today's just not the day.

346
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:40,586
They've let us stay when no one gives a lift... When no lover gives his Facebook password...

347
00:30:40,586 --> 00:30:43,780
Tomorrow... Please...

348
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,061
Have it your way...

349
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,467
Yeah?

350
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:00,185
You didn't call me...

351
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:02,845
Do you think I'd call you after that insult?

352
00:31:02,845 --> 00:31:05,470
Sorry... All my fault...

353
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,140
I was just being figurative...

354
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,520
But I'm glad you did it for me... My prince with the flower...

355
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,884
'Glad'? You what?
-Yeah...

356
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:20,020
You're glad? You asked me to leave!

357
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,097
I wanted to save you from Mr Abbas!

358
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,620
Is she touched in the head?

359
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,431
One way by day, another by night!

360
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,370
What?

361
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,459
Nothing... Why'd you say you don't like clowns?

362
00:31:35,459 --> 00:31:37,210
When did I say that?

363
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,503
Goodness, women these days!

364
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:42,690
Okay... I'm sorry...

365
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,010
Fix your mood, will you? I can't sleep.

366
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,660
Hmm... Okay...

367
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,706
Bye.

368
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:54,790
I'm taking the day off tomorrow. See you the day after.

369
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,765
Bye.

370
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,300
Move aside, Katie... Now where've I kept it?

371
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,256
What?

372
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,006
Where could my cell be?

373
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:29,056
What are you looking for, Dad?

374
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,576
My cell disappeared!

375
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:35,760
Scientifically speaking, cells divide. And multiply. They don't disappear.
-Ehh?

376
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,905
Not that cell, genius. Of course he's talking about the cells in the jail!

377
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,649
I got it, Dad. Right here!

378
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,180
Dad's not talking about batteries. He means his cell phone!

379
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,090
And...

380
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,210
Here's your cell phone, Dad.

381
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,491
Thank goodness...

382
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,810
What was that?

383
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,394
Quick IQ check.

384
00:33:04,394 --> 00:33:09,808
The ball bounces back if you've got a high IQ... In your case, I'm afraid it's mostly empty up there.

385
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:11,090
Very funny...

386
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,282
Just a minute... I didn't call you here to help me find my cell phone.

387
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:17,860
There's something --

388
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,739
I know! There's something you want to tell us. Right, Dad?

389
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:29,778
Obviously... I don't think he just wants to have a chat? Please be quick, Dad. I've got to go to work.

390
00:33:29,778 --> 00:33:37,180
Speaking of which, I see the channel's started going downhill ever since Anoushay got a job there!

391
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,131
She's the only one who works. The rest of you just throw a spanner in the works!

392
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:46,328
That's why I never took the risk...

393
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,785
Sergeant Molabux...

394
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,211
Yeah...

395
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:58,828
No, send them...

396
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,386
Right away.

397
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:03,173
You know my address.

398
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
Okay.

399
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,007
Done...

400
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:08,897
Blimey...

401
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,560
Good news!

402
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,725
The matchmaker called.

403
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:20,934
Someone wants to see Nigar.

404
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,979
Good morning.

405
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:40,086
We're looking for a flat... To rent... Have you got any?

406
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,511
One in Guriya Colony...
-Okay...

407
00:34:47,511 --> 00:34:51,500
But no one lasts there for long...

408
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,316
Rented for one month, free for the next two...

409
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:58,230
Why? A ghost?

410
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,616
Aye, a ghost and all sorts o' witches there.

411
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:06,790
I want nothing like last time.
-Don't worry, Dad.

412
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,730
We'll come up with something new...

413
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,525
Don't you dare!

414
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:15,790
You won't find matches that suit us, Dad...

415
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:24,094
Get going, Anoushay. I'd hate it if you took the day off... The folks at your channel might realise they can do just fine without you.

416
00:35:26,344 --> 00:35:32,913
The sarge doesn't let the estate agent rent his place out! Still, if that's what you want, go try your luck.

417
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:36,632
Dad?
-Yeah?

418
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:38,162
What's this?

419
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:40,682
What are you doing?

420
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,512
No bell here?

421
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,959
Good morning.
-Good morning. Bless you.

422
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:14,346
We wa --
-I know. Sergeant Molabux knows the man when he sees him!

423
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,590
Come.

424
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:23,016
I think he really meant it. About the ghost, I mean. Who d'you think told him?
-C'mon!

425
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,444
Bless you!

426
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:32,036
At ease, gentlemen...

427
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,370
Where are your Mum and Dad?

428
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,885
They're in Hyderabad.

429
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,645
Hello...

430
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,375
Hello...
-I'm Katie. She's Mickey.

431
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:47,779
My younger daughters...

432
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:51,020
How about a cuppa? Or a cold drink?

433
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,115
We'd love both.

434
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:54,620
Nigar!

435
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,025
Two cold cuppas, please!

436
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,250
My daughters are <i>very</i> simple and homely.</i>

437
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,098
I just love his jokes!

438
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,990
Meet Nigar, my eldest daughter.

439
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,869
Hello.

440
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,410
She's made it all herself.

441
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,975
Uhh... How much do you earn?

442
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,732
50 gee a month...

443
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,321
That's great...

444
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:52,958
When I have a half-decent job, that is.

445
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,394
So... Which of you is the lad?

446
00:37:58,394 --> 00:37:59,969
Ehh?

447
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,878
We're both lads...

448
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:08,986
Oh? I thought it was just you...

449
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,882
I wonder why he's surprised to find out about you!

450
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:17,771
Bet you couldn't see it!

451
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,604
Have some more.

452
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,865
Thank you.

453
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:26,590
Nigar's my eldest daughter...

454
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,800
Uh -- Okay...

455
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,390
I want to get her married first...

456
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,200
What do you say?

457
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,418
Aye, that's how it is... 'First come, first served'...ish!

458
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,816
I told you!

459
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,120
Why's he asking us? Just ask about the rent!

460
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,830
Mind if we have a look?

461
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:06,450
I'm sure we can decide better if we have a good look first...

462
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:10,908
I'm sure you've had a good look at Nigar already...

463
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:18,676
Yeah -- How much do you want?

464
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,480
I mean... Advance and all...

465
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,500
'Advance'?

466
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,530
'Advance'!

467
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,918
'Have a good look'... Lord...

468
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,611
Oh I'm gonna tell you everything!

469
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,879
Where's he off to?

470
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,339
Getting his gun...

471
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:50,050
What? His gun?

472
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,370
What's up with him? Welcoming us, giving us a treat, introducing us to you, and filling us with lead when we talk about the rent?

473
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,520
You want to rent this place?

474
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,181
Of course!

475
00:39:59,181 --> 00:40:00,414
Put the plate down.

476
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:04,668
Put it down! Christ, put it down already!
-I warned you!

477
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,670
You ain't gettin' out of here alive!

478
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,670
No, Dad! They want to rent this place!
-Wait, Dad!
-Listen, Dad!

479
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,000
It's a mistake, Dad!
-They're just looking for a place to rent!

480
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
