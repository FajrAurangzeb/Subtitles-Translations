1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,480
You ain't gettin' out of here alive!

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,981
No, Dad! They want to rent this place!
-Wait, Dad!
-Listen, Dad!

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,430
It's a mistake, Dad!
-They're just looking for a place to rent!

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,400
Dad!
-No, Dad!
-Wait!

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:22,370
Not so fast! They just want to rent this place. Let them have a look!
-Dad! Scientifically speaking, we ought to let them have a look.
-Easy, Dad...

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,937
They want to rent this place?

7
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,690
Yeah...

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,402
Okay.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,575
Come.

10
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:32,840
Go!

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,068
Double time!

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,492
Here --
-It's not for them!

13
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,782
It's for whoever's coming here with the proposal...

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,493
Ever thought you could help your sister out? Miss Lazybones!

15
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:54,630
Alright, I'll get back to you. After I'm through with these lads...

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,500
So, Sarge... We like the place.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,680
I take 6 months' advance. Then you hand me the cash every three months on the day you get the bill. I'll deposit everything myself.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,790
Uh, Sarge... I was wondering if there's a discount or something...

19
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,726
Out! Get out!

20
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:18,700
I knew you're stone broke before I even saw you!
-No, I've got some here... As an advance...

21
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,374
Besides, I only rent this place to married men.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,670
I've got four daughters.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,690
Yeah! He's married. I tell you, he is.

24
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,690
Yeah... Aren't you?
-Yeah... I am.

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,050
Got a family?

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,541
Yeah.
-Yeah. Of course.

27
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:45,920
Then what are you lookin' at? I wanna see 'em before you bring your things.
-Come.

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:58,320
Blimey, why'd you have to lie about it? You got me in a mess!

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,791
Why not? Besides, who's gonna throw us out when we've moved in?

30
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,900
By the way, it doesn't look like a bachelor pad if you ask me!

31
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,383
But we're looking at trouble if he finds out we --

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,230
Good day, Sarge. Come. Grab a pew. Make yourself at home.

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,100
How about you get out of mine instead? Out!

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,237
Why? What is it?
-Lemme tell you...

35
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,450
Where's your wife, eh?

36
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,690
Wife...

37
00:02:35,334 --> 00:02:36,944
She's --

38
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:39,280
We should tell him...

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,830
What it is is... She's -- Gone to her parents'... We had a domestic...

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,169
Oh... Gone to her parents'...

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,812
Very sorry to hear it... WHAT D'YA THINK I AM? I've spent my life at the police station!

42
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,322
What'd they bang you up for?

43
00:03:00,322 --> 00:03:04,530
He's the Sarge, so, of course... He's off his head...

44
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,220
D'you see something over here? Perhaps a sign reading 'moron'?

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,834
I can see it but I'm not sure if it says 'moron' or --

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,725
How 'bout you take a look from outside? Out!

47
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:21,928
Your wife is your key to this place!

48
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,291
You were right...

49
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,419
He's raving mad... Now we've lost our things and money!

50
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,760
How'd I find my wife now, eh, smarty-pants?

51
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,860
You've got to... If we want to stay there.

52
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,770
Why don't you marry one of his daughters?

53
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,918
I'm sure it'd save you the ren --

54
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,730
Found her!

55
00:03:55,108 --> 00:03:56,450
Where?

56
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,017
The veiled lady over there!

57
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,100
But she's got kids!

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,311
Forget that! Just -- Hold these, will you?

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,490
Hello again, Sarge.
-Hello...

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,790
My wife...

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,020
Your... Wife?

62
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,140
Right here.

63
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,686
Greet him.

64
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,320
Bless you.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,570
She mute or something?

66
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,117
No... Just... Veiling her voice.

67
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,463
He's like your father. Greet him.

68
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:46,393
Good day, Sarge.
-Good day. Bless you.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,690
And how'd she know I'm a Sergeant?
-I told her, of course.

70
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh, he suspects everyone...

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,398
Please give us the keys so we can go...
-Ah, yes, the keys...

72
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,418
Come.

73
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,449
Wait.

74
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:14,395
I haven't even welcomed you properly...

75
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:17,646
Perhaps you'd like a cuppa?
-Thank you, sir... We'll pass.

76
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:22,373
It's time for her prayers... She's gonna bless all of us.

77
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,790
How long have you been married?

78
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,137
5 years.
-3 years.

79
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:33,614
She says 3 years, you say 5... What is going on here?

80
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:37,695
You can add up our threes...

81
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:41,150
Three and three... And five! It doesn't quite add up.

82
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,972
It does if you subtract the 6 months she spent at her parents' and the 6 I spent at mine! 6 - 1 = 5!

83
00:05:51,540 --> 00:06:00,410
I get it now... But, I wonder... Why are you wearing men's shoes?

84
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,870
I'm -- You know... Veiling my shoes...

85
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,415
Veiling your shoes?

86
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,966
Fair enough... First time I've heard of it though...

87
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:23,390
Anyway... Make yourself at home here.

88
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,275
You can take that veil off...

89
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:31,250
Shahrukh! This man's asking me to take off my veil! No way I'm staying here! Let's go!

90
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,340
No... Wait...
-I didn't mean it like that...

91
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,720
What was the, uh, domestic about?

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,860
When?

93
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,224
You know, when...

94
00:06:43,224 --> 00:06:48,190
So you were making it up, eh?

95
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,863
No, sir...

96
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:56,790
The thing is, my Uncle asked her to take off her veil...

97
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,330
She almost left me!

98
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,120
If you tried to force her, she may leave me again... Forever, this time! Please...

99
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,010
No way...

100
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,280
Don't worry...

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,980
Don't mind trifles like these...

102
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,780
Make yourself at home here...

103
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:25,573
Just let me know if you need anything, okay? Go.

104
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,970
Katie, Mickey, Anoushay, Nigar...

105
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:15,420
Dad... I've asked you so many times to say our names in the right order... Like, I'm the eldest, so say my name first... You slip up every time.

106
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,985
What? Yeah? Go on!

107
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:18,570
What is it, Dad?

108
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,978
Our new tenant has moved in with his wife...

109
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:32,300
But... I don't know why... I have my suspicions about his wife...

110
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,020
Why don't you let her husband worry about that?

111
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,460
These suspicions killed Mum!

112
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,960
So where do we come in?

113
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,649
Go and... Tell them we're eating together.

114
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:52,970
Okay. I'll tell them we're having dinner with them.
-No.

115
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:00,190
Tell them they're having dinner with us.

116
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,814
Okay.

117
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,930
Where's your wife? And who's dancing?

118
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,265
Dancing?

119
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:19,624
Ah, yes...

120
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,473
My...

121
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:22,750
Oops, sorry...

122
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,761
My wife has an upset stomach... She's gone to the loo.

123
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,600
I bolt the door from the outside too!

124
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,466
The bolt inside was broken...

125
00:09:39,466 --> 00:09:40,850
We're here to see her.

126
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,239
She's gone to the loo. Come back tomorrow.

127
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:46,147
She's coming out tomorrow?

128
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,300
Oh, she takes ages! She delayed our wedding by a day!

129
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,425
You could've fixed the date for a day later. No delays then!

130
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:59,002
Alright, we'll wait.

131
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,143
How do I throw them out?

132
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,578
Is that a lizard?

133
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,180
A lizard?

134
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,300
Been ages since I laid my hands on one! Ooh, it's hunting season!

135
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,480
I'm hunting her this time!

136
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,900
Either way, I'll throw it... At someone!

137
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,753
Blimey, they aren't even scared of it!

138
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,676
Where is it?

139
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,230
We're getting bored.

140
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,970
How 'bout you show us your wedding album? Where is it?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,316
Throw 'em out already!
-Calm down... And hang up before you get us both killed!

142
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,440
But all the women are veiled... They look the same!

143
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,220
That's my wife's family for you...

144
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,247
How d'you identify her?

145
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:15,334
Very simple. I just ask.

146
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,618
How much time do you need, man? It's a blimmin' furnace in here!

147
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:30,087
Shut up! It's easy for you to say that from in there! They've cornered me! Bye!

148
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,700
Dinner? No th --
-Aye, we're having dinner with you tonight... But downstairs.

149
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,570
But -- Not today... I mean, just look at how sick she is!

150
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,390
First time someone's turned us down...

151
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,596
I smell something dodgy!

152
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:54,990
Tomorrow. I promise!

153
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,360
Thank you.

154
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,058
Did any of you see her?

155
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:23,010
No... But we saw his wedding album... She's veiled in every picture!

156
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,240
What does he do?

157
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,611
Nothing much, judging by his salary...

158
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:34,500
He's turned off the lights... I just saw... Do you think they turned in so early?

159
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,678
Turn off the lights! Or they'll think we're up and barge in!

160
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,032
First time I've seen you scared of girls.

161
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,980
Where are you taking my laptop?

162
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,420
There's a virus on mine. I need to do some things... I'll mail it to myself from here.

163
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:57,511
Sleep early. We gotta leave first thing in the morning, or the Sarge will start interrogating us again!

164
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,598
Good point.

165
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:02,560
Something's not right...

166
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,960
But no idea what it is.

167
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,411
I'm impressed by you, Dad...

168
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:13,402
But no idea why.

169
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:19,986
I'll see his wife before going to office. Find out everything about her.

170
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,817
Why are you so quiet?

171
00:13:27,817 --> 00:13:34,420
I was wondering... Why do you always behave like you don't know me? At the office, I mean...

172
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,474
I'm afraid of Mr Abbas...

173
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:38,952
Oh?

174
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,388
We should go out someday...

175
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:47,080
Sure... How about the bistro at the crossroads? See you there.

176
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,158
Bistro?

177
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:56,736
No... Something better... The coffee shop near the shop? 4 p.m.?

178
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,260
Okay. Done.

179
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,430
Great. See you. Bye.

180
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,313
Bye.

181
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:32,965
I'm the Sarge's daughter... I'd like to meet your wife.

182
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,183
My wife?

183
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:39,320
Ah, yes... Her... She's in the washroom...

184
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,530
Call her, then.

185
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:52,829
Uh, no... She takes ages... She's in the washroom until the evening... Washing... Her face! Over and over again! Would you believe it?

186
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:55,910
Until the evening?
-Yeah.

187
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,798
OCD or something?

188
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:04,730
Yeah. That.
-Makes sense...

189
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,080
♪ <i>It's a wonderful world!</i> ♪

190
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,760
Who's singing?

191
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,080
No one? It's -- My wife...

192
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,376
The cold water makes her sound manly...

193
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:25,628
I'm sure you're getting late... You should get going... I'll tell you when h -- she's out.

194
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:29,756
Okay, I'll be back in the evening.
-Sure thing.

195
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:40,540
How do women live in this? I nearly break a bone ever other second!
-Keep your voice down!

196
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,012
And speak in a womanly voice... What if --

197
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,863
They're here...

198
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,858
Hey! How you doin'?

199
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,070
Hi!

200
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,810
Going somewhere?
-To the office, yeah.

201
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,616
Just a second...

202
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,550
Wow... She's smart!

203
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:11,640
Step aside... Please take that veil off. We want to see you. I bet my face glows more than yours! Nigar's losing this one!

204
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,520
We're getting late... C'mon, Glucose...

205
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,030
Glucose! What a sweet name! Scientifically speaking, that makes her husband very likely to be diabetic!

206
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,760
Sweet Mary, what's she saying? May you stay healthy!

207
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
Come!

208
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,310
Outta my way!

209
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,980
So sweet!

210
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:42,670
Looks like we've rented trouble, Shahrukh... You realise we're gonna be thrown in the slammer if we got caught?
-So be it! It was you who said I'm married! Now stay quiet!

211
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,907
Aye, where to?

212
00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:48,860
Hey...

213
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,581
We're going to the office.

214
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,764
I suppose your wife's here?

215
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,081
Yeah.

216
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:04,020
When did he come in?

217
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,550
Just about... Now?

218
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,882
He's dropping me at the office.
-Yeah...

219
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,993
Okay. Go.

220
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:18,466
Take care!

221
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,763
Peep-a-boo!

222
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,343
Not cricket! Then again, it's his place.

223
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,842
Gor blimey...

224
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:04,121
But what's he looking at?

225
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:07,394
If I'm smart, it doesn't mean I have to do all the thinking!

226
00:18:07,394 --> 00:18:13,937
Scientifically speaking, you don't need to think much if you're smart! Just like...

227
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:19,732
I say, let's go ask Dad!
-C'mon.

228
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,856
Dad!
-Whoa!

229
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,310
How many times do I have to tell you - tell before you yell?

230
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:33,150
Scientifically speaking, it's wrong to peep into someone's place like that. Legally too!

231
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:41,182
Lemme tell you... I won't let you take anything from inside. Willy nilly.

232
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:43,070
Do I look like a thief?

233
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,800
Worse. You look like a cop.

234
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:53,007
You have no idea... This bloke...

235
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,150
Shahrukh - he's a blimmin' cruel husband.

236
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,201
Locked his poor wife in!
-Poor girl...

237
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,338
Say 'poor wife' again, Dad?

238
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:07,750
Poor wife...

239
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,990
Blimey, he looks like a poor old man when he says 'poor wife'!

240
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,260
We saw him leave with his wife!

241
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,745
No way! He just left with that rascal who was with him when he first came here... He said his wife's upstairs...

242
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:32,444
Scientifically speaking, cops retire from duty but never from suspecting people!

243
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:38,110
We've got to break open this door!

244
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,470
No need... Wait and watch...

245
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,927
Alohomora!
-Eh?
-Ehh?

246
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:54,915
I think the spell doesn't work for locks made by this company...

247
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,106
Mrs Glucose!

248
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,595
Mrs Glucose!

249
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:03,891
Mrs Glucose!

250
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:06,283
Open the door! It's us!

251
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:09,050
Wait! What are you doing?

252
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,100
Freeing a poor woman locked in by her cruel husband!

253
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,977
My wife's right here!

254
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,282
Gotcha, Dad!

255
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:23,420
You said she's upstairs!

256
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,282
You said it... I just nodded! What d'you think, Glucose?

257
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:31,909
Yeah... That's what happened... I think...

258
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:36,187
Glucose? But wasn't her name... Razia?

259
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:39,690
Yeah, it is, but I like to call her Glucose because... She's so sweet...

260
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,784
Okay...

261
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:47,425
What'd you feel when you married him? That you're marrying him or treating him? Glucose?

262
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:54,879
I -- I forgot my laptop up here... So sh -- he's brought me back so I can get it... Excuse me...

263
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,520
Glucose...

264
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,770
Dad!

265
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:24,340
I thought -- Just -- checking the hinges, you know...

266
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,580
Take care.

267
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,428
Bless you...

268
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:38,140
Bless the two of you.

269
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,493
Hi!

270
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,023
Bye.

271
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,280
Why don't you talk to me?

272
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,361
I only talk to people I like.

273
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,357
What's up with your memory? Head over heels for me at night and not even talking to be by day!

274
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:30,025
Anyway... What's the programme today?

275
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:35,880
Oh, nothing much, although I do feel like smothering the life out of a creepy cad!

276
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,022
Poor Mr Abbas!
-Poor you, more like!

277
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:45,726
Don't bother. A wink or a smile might just kill me!

278
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:56,930
Mind if I say something? Actually - I don't care if I do - you're such a third-rate flirt! Cheap!

279
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,100
I expected worse.

280
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,420
Anyway... What about the date?

281
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,980
Check your phone...

282
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,453
I mean going to the café for a nice litt --

283
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,834
Don't even think about it!

284
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,220
Who does he think he is?

285
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,573
Such a weird girl!

286
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,806
Hi!

287
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:47,964
Bye!

288
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:51,000
What about the date?

289
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:10,240
♪ <i>Just like good old-fashioned love...</i> ♪

290
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,878
Always busy with your blooming ball! Careful!

291

Your cuppa...

292
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:22,989
What are you thinking?

293
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:26,670
I'm thinking...

294
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,950
Why Shahrukh's wife doesn't show her face...

295
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,570
You're thinking that I'm thinking about what you're thinking.

296
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,910
And Nigar's thinking how I know what you're thinking...

297
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,980
And Mickey's thinking about what she should be thinking about!

298
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,740
Jesus, I lost my train of thought in that mess!

299
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,575
You were thinking why Shahrukh's wife doesn't show her face!

300
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,650
Ah, yes...

301
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:02,063
Scientifically speaking, it's their problem. None of our business.

302
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:06,730
Scientifically speaking...

303
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm thinking the veil...

304
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,470
May be hiding a man!

305
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,310
Splendid! I guess great minds do think alike!

306
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:27,725
I'm sure the veil hides someone - a man or a woman. And we're gonna find out who he - or she - is!

307
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:28,651
How?

308
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm thinking of something... Think with me...

309
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,541
Anoushay!

310
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:16,976
Hello?

311
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:21,515
Hello. Where are you, Shahrukh? I've been waiting at the restaurant for ages!

312
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:22,930
Really?

313
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,463
I didn't come because I thought your mood was off...

314
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:27,790
Come here quick. I can't wait much longer!

315
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,873
Coming... Right away!

316
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:34,465
Wow!

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,260
When do you plan to start shooting this?

318
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:18,880
The set isn't ready yet, sir... Gotta work on it... Lighting, and all... Before we start shooting.

319
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:27,684
Lovely... Tell your team I'm waiting for them in the conference room.

320
00:27:27,684 --> 00:27:35,570
Get all their termination letters ready! Kick 'em out! I've been waiting two weeks and you can't even get a blasted set ready! That's awful leadership!

321
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:43,823
Sir -- I'll go -- Ca --
-Go call them! 'I'll go -- Ca --'... Jesus, it's been two weeks already, what are you even doing, like the set -- Komal!

322
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,497
Blimey, Anoushay... Where are you?

323
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:40,784
Hello? Where are you? That fat cow Komal's here! Sitting at the table... Snoring! She's wearing so much lipstick it looks like she's been drinking blood!

324
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:45,654
And look at her confidence! As if whoever she's waiting for is blind! She's mad, I tell you!

325
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:50,611
I'm right here! Where are you?

326
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:53,516
Right here!

327
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,456
Oh...

328
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:57,941
I'm sorry I --

329
00:28:57,941 --> 00:28:59,611
I was just fooling around!

330
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:04,550
They all just fool around with me! Come.

331
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,943
Yeah...

332
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:14,440
Oops... I forgot to lock my car... Just a sec. Here.

333
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,253
Your car? You don't have a car!

334
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,077
Not fair! You gave me Komal's number instead? I've been saying God-knows-what to her thinking it's you!

335
00:29:33,077 --> 00:29:37,290
Ever thought you could - I don't know, maybe - use your brain?

336
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,223
I almost went on a date with her!

337
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,251
Are you serious?

338
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,010
Poor Komal!

339
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,207
Poor Komal or poor me?

340
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,770
If it isn't your girlfriend!

341
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,740
I'll make you pay for this!

342
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,794
Getting nervous before your girlfriend, eh?

343
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,374
Hi, Komal!

344
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:01,389
Hi!

345
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:02,622
How're you doing?

346
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:05,471
Fine... Just this little headache...

347
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,200
Why?

348
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,393
K -- Ko...

349
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:25,097
What do you even come here to do? We're a bloody live channel! You even understand what that means? What the hell is wrong with you?

350
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:32,430
I want this show on air from next week! If you can't do it, you better leave!

351
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,385
What's the problem, Monsieur le directeur?

352
00:30:34,385 --> 00:30:36,650
We haven't even finalised the set...

353
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,747
Oh...

354
00:30:37,747 --> 00:30:46,210
I showed him two designs but he didn't like either of them... I've got a third one here...

355
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,022
Here... Sir?

356
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,269
Oh, this...

357
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,420
This ugly piece of crap!

358
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:02,040
Let's ask around. D'you like it?

359
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,591
You? What d'you think of this? Nice?

360
00:31:06,513 --> 00:31:08,980
And you, Komal? Like any part of it?

361
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:16,826
What d'you expect people to say when you can't say a word about your set? When you can't comment on your own work?

362
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:24,373
Is that what a month's output is for you? It's been two months, Anoushay... Is that how you work?

363
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:28,220
Komal... What d'you think we should do?

364
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,756
Termination?

365
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,864
Very good.

366
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,324
Give it to her.

367
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,416
If that's how you perform, I'm gonna have to prepare a new team! We can't go on with you folks! This is terrible! Terrible!

368
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,073
Sir...

369
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,150
Just a minute... Please.

370
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,755
Anoushay...

371
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:54,116
Why don't you show him the set you showed me?

372
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,110
Which one, Shahrukh? I don't think I showed you any --

373
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,303
Just a minute... I'll show you, sir...

374
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,937
I've talked to a set designer, who --

375
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,820
Have a look at this, sir... It is mind-blowing. Out of the world!

376
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,842
No channel in the world has anything like it! Yeah, c'mon, take a look!

377
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:24,345
The lighting looks fantastic... If we can pull this off, yeah... It'll be great!

378
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,686
Why didn't you show him this one, Anoushay?

379
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:29,130
Wow...

380
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,180
Good. Excuse me.

381
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,850
You designed it, Anoushay?
-Of course!

382
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,988
Very nice.

383
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:42,678
But, sir --
-Please, not now... Not when he likes it!

384
00:32:42,678 --> 00:32:49,053
The problem with her, sir, is she's as hesitant as she's talented... She just lacks confidence! That's all...

385
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:53,170
I think it's a good one! Well done, Anoushay. Appreciate the effort. I like it.

386
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,813
Okay, carry on, everyone. Start working on the set tomorrow.

387
00:32:58,813 --> 00:33:00,480
Good job.

388
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,250
Oh, and...

389
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,586
By the way...

390
00:33:03,586 --> 00:33:08,556
Give her that letter back. I don't think we're gonna need it now.

391
00:33:08,556 --> 00:33:11,001
Good job, Anoushay...

392
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,919
Have a look at your set?

393
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,377
You said you'll make me pay... But then, all of this... I don't get it.

394
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:56,440
It wasn't easy to get this job, you know... Had to step in to save it...

395
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
But he was firing me...

396
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:06,292
You're so talented... I'm sure you can get a job anywhere you like... I had to save myself! After all, I almost didn't even get this one!

397
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:09,631
Wow... That's a rather convoluted pick-up line...

398
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,958
Would you like to hear a more straightforward one?

399
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:16,972
Who made this set, by the way?

400
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,760
The same friend whose car I was driving...

401
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,830
He's bringing us together... Indirectly!

402
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,596
Got to throw a pick-up line in every sentence, eh?

403
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,830
So... Is it for free?

404
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:34,290
No. You've got to pay for it... With your number.

405
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,560
7.

406
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,940
I mean your mobile number. Not your shoe size.

407
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,214
Note it down.

408
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,009
Here. Write it yourself.

409
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:48,110
I want your number this time! I'm still paying for the last time!

410
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,210
It's mine.
-Okay.

411
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,047
Hey...

412
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:58,015
Yeah?

413
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:01,000
Nothing...

414
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
