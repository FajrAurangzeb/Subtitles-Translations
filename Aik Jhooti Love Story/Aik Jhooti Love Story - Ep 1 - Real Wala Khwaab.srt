1
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:24,668
<i>I'm whilin' sleepless nights waitin' for you,</i>

2
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:30,170
<i>Eyes searching just for you,</i>

3
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,960
<i>I know you're a-mine</i>

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,920
<i>It's destined by the Divine,</i>

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,470
<i>My Sweeting...</i>

6
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,940
<i>I've got nothin' but you...</i>

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,387
<i>My Sweeting...</i>

8
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:05,630
<i>I'd die without you...</i>

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,090
Episode 1: (Un)Real Dreams

10
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,231
The Royal Family is known for timeless love stories, the best-known of which is perhaps Prince Charles and Lady Diana's.

11
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:18,605
And it appears this young man has picked up the baton.

12
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:32,130
His is a fairytale of a Prince falling for an ordinary girl and making her a Princess of the United Kingdom, and the Queen of his heart.

13
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,910
The Royal Family won't let the world forget the story of Charles and Diana.

14
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,038
Blimey, they all want to be TV commentators these days.

15
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,700
Just look at his atrocious English!

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,160
He doesn't even know that Harry's sixth in line.

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,927
He's as likely to be the King of the UK as William is to grow hair.

18
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,748
Lovely comparison.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O Lord! Bless my daughters too!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't she look much older than him?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She does. Because she is.</i>

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She looks so... Ordinary. But Diana! Ahh... She was one graceful lady...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm watching, Mum...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's stopping you?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm listening, too.
-It's all so wrong... Everything he's said.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'A tale of undying love! Prince Charles and Lady Diana'? Oh, please! He doesn't even know how many times they had a domestic! And the divorce! Jesus...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happens when you don't listen to your parents! All this love story balderdash... It ain't no good!

28
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,007
Not again...

29
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,990
The lights gotta go off whenever I want to watch telly!

30
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,470
How 'bout a nice cuppa on that note?

31
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,450
My one purpose in life, innit? Get yous alls a nice cuppa.

32
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,510
Nah, get me some fritters too if you like!

33
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,535
Everyone else has got a UPS!

34
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:02,670
Hear that?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so costly! But I'm sure Salahuddin will work something out. If only she could learn to wait!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder what kind of girls get to live out a fairytale with their Prince Charming...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you thinking, Salma? You've got to live out the tea girl's life!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was wondering who it could be...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, you're nearly blind already, but you'd still rather be at this computer at midnight!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had my glasses on until just now...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, what's all this craze about? I mean, they got married... What now?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's their wedding.
-It's over. What's next? You droppin' them home?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut it down. Right now. You're at this computer all night! You have no idea about the electricity bill, do you?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess I'm gonna have to fix it tomorrow.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'm whilin' sleepless nights waitin' for you,</i>

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Eyes searching just for you,</i>

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every breath eager for you,</i>

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Gettin' by on memories of you...</i>

50
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,464
Hey, Sohail!

51
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:44,931
Come in, Your Majesty! With due respect, may I say that you're late again?
-Proper mess last night, I tell you!

52
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:51,840
A bunch o' terrorists abducted me Dad! We looked for 'im all night... The cops found 'im this morning!

53
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,940
You ever ashamed of yourself?

54
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,720
You're late everyday. But you had to get your Dad abducted this time!

55
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,510
Ask anyone you like. They got on 'is rickshaw and took 'im to the National Stadium at gunpoint!

56
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:07,550
What've you been watching these days?
-What?

57
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,750
I swear to God --
-Oh, can it... Just get me the laptops that came in yesterday. 'I swEAr tO GoD'.

58
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,010
Lemme finish it!
-How 'bout I boot you out and finish it for you?

59
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,003
I forgot two screws... Sorry!

60
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:22,429
Just a second...

61
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,320
You better not be late again!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what I'm gonna give you on your birthday?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Glasses that don't look from the previous century. I mean, who in the world wears <i>that</i>?</i>

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're priceless. Dad got it from the US. Mum says you can't get one like it anywhere.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's because it's ancient. By the way, why does your Mum have to give you all the old stuff? You look, like, ten years older!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
