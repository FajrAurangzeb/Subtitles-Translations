Episode 12 - 'A Hate for War'

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,440
Why am I always thinking of Neha?

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,477
Why do I care who he's with?

23
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,297
We grieve together...

24
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,080
As friends...

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,540
But...

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,788
Nothing else...

00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,447

Don't you think you're being too sentimental? Slow down...

38
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:06,407
It's about my self-respect!

39
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:11,587
I ain't your ordinary Indian woman who'd do everything to please her man.

40
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,927
Vishal's not even interested in me... He's interested in Sarah!

41
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,267
He's not interested in her... Where does she come in?

42
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:22,801
Boys make friends with girls... But that doesn't mean they love them...

43
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,307
Maybe...

44
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:31,840
But I curse the girl who goes after a boy who's made it clear that he loves someone else!

45
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,776
Your Uncle's gonna pull me up for this...

46
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:42,040
Just do as he says... Take your share and jet off to Canada...

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,578
Mum said Neha's going back?

48
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,966
Aye.

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,260
She felt too insulted here...

50
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,048
We've got so many matches for her... All <i>his</i> loss...

51
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:38,750
I'm sorry if it's something he said...

52
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,940
You don't need to say sorry, Aunt... It's just... Vishal ain't my type... He doesn't see things our way...

53
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,510
But I don't blame him for it... It's just...

54
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,639
What with the whole family serving in the Army and all...

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,609
Ticket confirmed!

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,408
Anyway... There's a world beyond patriotism...

57
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:06,260
Could you please tell Vishal?

58
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,799
Hello!

59
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,280
Yeah?
-Need your number, lydy.

60
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,897
Wanna see my shoe number?
-Oh, I wouldn't Chinese Blind!

61
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,259
I'm Colonel Sherali's daughter...

62
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,769
The late Colonel.
-Aye, so wot?

63
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,160
What?

64
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,368
What?
-I asked for your number, lydy... Not your old man's rank, or if 'e's even jack's...

65
00:05:54,368 --> 00:06:01,378
I asked for your number, lydy... Not your old man's rank, or if 'e's even jack's...

66
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,430
'Ey! Wait!

67
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,087
Not so fast!

68
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,110
Sla daahhhn! 'Ey!

69
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,158
I just wanna Rabbit and Pork!
-Grandpa!

70
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:20,378
Wait!
-Grandpa!

71
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:23,918
Grandpa!
-'Ey!

72
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,538
He's been bothering me, Grandpa...

73
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,798
Who are you?

74
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,260
How dare you come here?

75
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,523
Gr --

76
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:42,233
Stop pokin' your fireman's hose where it doesn't belong, pot and pan... In'cha gettin' cilla black for Left in the bleedin' Lurch or summit?

77
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,638
He's gone, Grandpa...

78
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,010
I never thought...

79
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,467
They'd reward a hero's daughter like that...

80
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:59,188
Everyone knows my son's name... His rank...

81
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,227
But --
-It's okay...

82
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:06,867
Just -- Don't tell Mum or Granny, okay? They'll get all worked up...

83
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,068
Don't go out again okay?

84
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,918
Don't go out alone...

85
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,859
I'll talk to the Unit...

86
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,967
I saw his number plate...

87
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,558
I've been missing you again, Dad...

88
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,447
We need you in our lives...

89
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:50,507
All of us...

90
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:55,647
Even as the nation seems to forgot your sacrifice...

91
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,996
They don't even remember your name...

92
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:03,990
Or that I'm your daughter... A hero's daughter...

93
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,438
I lose courage with each day...

94
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,628
It's too much for me to bear...

95
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,869
Hello?

96
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,250
Could you check your email?

97
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,984
Mum sent you some exercises. Print them and give them to Aunt...

98
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,878
I didn't see it...

99
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:41,032
I'll tell Mum when I check it...

100
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,810
Have you got the flu?

101
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,668
No?

102
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,797
You crying, then?

103
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,600
No... It's the flu...

104
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,250
No, you're crying...

105
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,389
What happened?

106
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,348
First time someone dared harass me...

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,187
I'm missing Dad so much...

108
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,260
It means nothing...

109
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,340
Nothing... 'Dying for the nation'... 'Protecting our borders'...

110
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,908
The nation doesn't care...

111
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,550
A hero's daughter is hardly different from any other girl for them.

112
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,528
None of it matters to anyone...

113
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,278
I've never felt more unsafe...

114
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,098
Stop pokin' your fireman's hose where it doesn't belong, pot and pan... In'cha gettin' cilla black for Left in the bleedin' Lurch or summit?

115
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,867
What is it?

116
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,127
Why are you still up?

117
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,310
Nothing, really...

118
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,753
Just not sleepy...

119
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,588
But...

120
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,655
Why?

121
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,358
No idea...

122
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,550
I ain't just worried about me...

123
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,110
I'm worried about Noria too...

124
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,751
And Mum...

125
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,898
Grandpa can't fight the world for us...

126
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:33,100
The Unit can't save us from them all...

127
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,510
If Dad were here...

128
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,652
None of them would dare look at us the wrong way...

129
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,788
What happened? You still up?

130
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:01,408
Uhh...

131
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,301
Nothing...

132
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,369
Just...

133
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,254
Sitting here...

134
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,158
Mum...

135
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:15,119
Mum, I --

136
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,869
Wanted to know...
-Hmm...

137
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:22,821
If someone's... Bothering you...

138
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:26,300
No. What d'you mean?
-I mean, anyone --

139
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,457
Harassing you?

140
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:30,950
Of course not...

141
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,967
But why d'you ask?

142
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:34,498
Just... Asking...

143
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:37,409
But if anyone does, just lemme know.

144
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,829
What can you do about it?

145
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:41,912
You'll see.

146
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:45,672
Gives me all the more reason to not tell you.

147
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,017
What, you don't want me to protect you?

148
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:50,666
I can protect myself, thank you!

149
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:55,590
Who d'you think protected me all these years when your Dad was not around?

150
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:58,968
Tell Sarah I know how to deal with that lot, okay?

151
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:02,868
Sarah? Where does she come in?

152
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,048
Someone's bothering her, yes?

153
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,688
How d'you know?

154
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:12,308
You ain't that upset for no reason.

155
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:20,108
Tell her to stop crying and face them. Life's got its unpleasant moments, but you gotta face them.

156
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,310
Mum!
-Hmm?

157
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,401
Well...

158
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,348
I --

159
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:36,048
I don't want --

160
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:38,860
Pari and Laxmi to face any of it...

161
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,097
They're too young...

162
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:45,937
I know... But they won't always be, yes?

163
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,697
The Indian Army... Live a life that's extraordinary.

164
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,920
I fire hard.

165
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,798
But I fire strong.

166
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,669
I like solving problems.

167
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,489
Facing an enemy on higher ground? Problem.

168
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,910
Being two points down? Problem.

169
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,850
But the bigger the problem, the sweeter the victory.

170
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,460
What do I like more? Going to battle, or firing my pistol?

171
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,690
I like the fact that I do both, my dear...

172
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,940
We're India's most exciting workplace, and we're making you an offer.

173
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,567
The Indian Army. Live a life th --

174
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:27,150
I really like cars, so just two weeks into the job, they gave me a company car.

175
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,258
A big one at that! With fourteen wheels and quite the ground clearance.

176
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:35,320
It can go pretty much anywhere! But it's not the easiest thing to p --

177
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,246
Never enlist in the army...

178
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:54,497
I won't.

179
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,927
No idea why I told you any of it the other day...

180
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,738
That's what I'm thinking... Why'd I tell you anything?

181
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,418
Has your sister-in-law left?
-Nah, she's still here...

182
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,718
Her niece left though.

183
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,300
They wanted to get her married to Vishal, but he refused...

184
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,909
They'd be fuming...

185
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,870
How d'you know?

186
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,408
My sisters-in-law got here for Sherali's funeral... From the UK and America...

187
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:10,728
The elder one wanted Sarah to marry her son...

188
00:17:10,728 --> 00:17:13,538
My brother wanted her married to his...

189
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:17,999
Sarah refused, and they left, fuming.

190
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:24,748
I always thought I'm unlucky I don't have siblings.

191
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:30,608
But looking at Pratibha's greed...

192
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:33,719
I feel I'm quite fortunate indeed.

193
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:37,938
Or... They'd be here to bother us too...

194
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,279
Mind if I asked something?
-Hmm?

195
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,819
What if someone asked for some money?

196
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:47,189
Just refuse!

197
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:50,113
What if it's Sherali's dearest sister?

198
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:53,630
What if she told you she's helpless?

199
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,948
Refuse more clearly.

200
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,348
She's got her husband, yes?

201
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:00,978
Yes.

202
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,658
She doesn't need your help.

203
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:08,702
She ain't more helpless than you.

204
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:12,733
Don't waste the money that's your kids'.

205
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,019
You there?

206
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,329
Aye...

207
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,858
I'm thinking...

208
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:25,458
How I can turn her down...

209
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,420
We're trying our best, but you know they're members of the ruling party...

210
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,918
I told you I want the house vacated ASAP.

211
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:46,078
You can file a complaint against them.

212
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:48,779
Who's gonna help with all the legal paperwork?

213
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:53,250
I'm sure the Colonel's son will help you.

214
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,650
He's a kid...

215
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,090
A student...

216
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,367
He's got to focus on his studies, not get involved in this feud...

217
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:09,488
As you see fit, ma'am... We're doing our best. I'll keep you posted. Thank you.

218
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,588
Thank you...

219
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,327
Anurag's not taking my call...

220
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,518
He's not texting back...

221
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:22,228
He won't talk to me until I've got my share...

222
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,490
You got me in this mess, Mum...

223
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,950
Oi jist talked ter de Unit...

224
00:19:30,338 --> 00:19:32,807
They want me to file a complaint...

225
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:36,137
It's gonna take some time...

226
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,070
No idea how I can make you understand...

227
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,647
Canny Anurag wait a wee!?

228
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:47,618
How long can I stay here?

229
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:50,287
Why don't you think about me?

230
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,670
I say, just get Vishal and Ne --
-Shut up!

231
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,840
End this chapter right now.

232
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,293
Get it?

233
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,010
You want your share? You'll get it.

234
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,588
So just -- Shut up!

235
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,880
Over there, yeah.
-Alright.

236
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,761
Careful!

237
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:37,281
Are they new here?

238
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:40,241
Yes ma'am. Just got here.

239
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,850
Careful...

240
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,279
Alright, next one...

241
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,229
Hey!

242
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,958
Geroff me!

243
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,240
Hey!

244
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,841
Just lemme go! Hey!

245
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,310
Good day, ma'am.

246
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,201
Can't believe my eyes!

247
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:38,770
Good to see you again, Gopi...

248
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,090
Hope everything's good.

249
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,261
No...

250
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,655
Nothing ain't good after my brother...

251
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,736
Your sister-in-law and her kids?

252
00:21:48,736 --> 00:21:50,906
She ain't my SIL now.

253
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:52,146
What?

254
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,796
Wife.

255
00:21:53,796 --> 00:21:55,866
What d'you mean?

256
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,641
We said our I-dos!

257
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,088
I mean, there she was... Alone with her kids...

258
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,487
Good.

259
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,661
But...

260
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:14,330
Why the hurry?

261
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,038
C'mon, she was a young widow... With kids!

262
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:20,729
Plus, the Army stopped paying her his pension...

263
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:23,649
They want to 'investigate' him!

264
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:26,851
She needed someone to support her...

265
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,929
How'd she agree so easily?

266
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:33,304
How couldn't she?

267
00:22:33,304 --> 00:22:35,503
She had no choice.

268
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,168
Didn't she love your brother?

269
00:22:43,168 --> 00:22:45,408
Perhaps she did, perhaps she didn't...

270
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,498
But love stands no chance...

271
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:50,869
When you're struggling to make ends meet...

272
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,840
And your stomach starts growling...

273
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,781
She was in dire need, yes, she was...

274
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,080
It's getting late... Where's Vishal?

275
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,171
I'll have a look...

276
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,809
Congratulations on Sarah's admission.

277
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:26,698
Sherali's dream is coming true!

278
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:29,249
The Lord has been kind...

279
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,519
Sarah's worked hard, despite everyth --

280
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,120
You've worked hard too.

281
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,490
After Sherali's death... In her place, most girls won't even be able to sit an exam...

282
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,600
Aye... Just pray things go on fine...

283
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,830
I always pray for you...

284
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,288
You're the only ones with Mum and Dad...

285
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,590
Amna...

286
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,668
I asked for something...

287
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,738
Zafar's been asking me about it...

288
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,461
Ayesha...

289
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:13,868
I'm sorry...

290
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,899
For what?

291
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,868
I can't help you... Sorry...

292
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,568
I --

293
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:31,109
I thought about it a lot...

294
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,440
This money... Is for my kids... And --

295
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,870
It's not like we said it's ours.

296
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,488
We don't have a right over it... We're just borrowing it in times of need...

297
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:45,740
I understand, Ayesha...

298
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,140
But...

299
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,461
I can't give you any of it...

300
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,138
Why? You're the only one who can give it away...

301
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,999
Yes... I can...

302
00:24:57,999 --> 00:25:00,580
But I won't...

303
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,248
Did you tell Mum and Dad?

304
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,398
Yes.

305
00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:12,262
And -- They're with you on this?

306
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,893
No.

307
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:16,190
I'm turning you down myself...

308
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,238
As the mother of Sherali's kids...

309
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,686
Ayesha...

310
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:30,522
You were and always will be their Aunt...

311
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:32,137
But I think...

312
00:25:32,137 --> 00:25:36,767
Sherali helped you all he could while he was here...

313
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:39,730
But...

314
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,299
No longer...

315
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,990
Vishal here yet?

316
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,771
No.

317
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,549
Vishal!

318
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:11,290
What happened?

319
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,959
Vishal?

320
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,270
Vishal!

321
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,808
Hey!

322
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Vishal! Wait!

324
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,151
Wow, you're lovely...

325
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,182
And you're... Average...

326
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:39,960
And aye... I'm lovely. So?

327
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,810
Why don't you apply to the Army?

328
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,060
I don't want to marry a soldier, Vishal...
