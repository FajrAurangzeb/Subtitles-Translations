1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,398
The shelling's getting worse, sir!

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:10,030
Pakistan fans, you need 136 more runs to win...

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,234
India putting up a fantastic show...

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,349
In the air, and Sreesanth takes it!
-Yeah!
-Woo hoo!

5
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:25,399
I hate cricket!

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,846
Terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir...

7
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:34,050
We've reason to believe there's still one terrorist in...

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,620
India made them pay.
-India can't get away with it.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,443
Dad was a brave man. He stopped the enemy in their tracks.

10
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:46,634
My Dad said everything we've got to say to Sarah Sherali's Dad.

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,430
The children of two martyrs face off...

12
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,530
We're enemies, aren't we? My Dad... Because of your bloody old man!

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,980
Our enemies would do well to remember that it won't end with one Vijay Malhotra.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,260
Your old man's responsible for everything we're going through!

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,508
You cut the Paki down to size!

16
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:07,796
Good show, m'boy! Way to put that girl in her place!

17
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,230
Not fair, Papa...

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,545
Sarah?

19
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,530
Alright?

20
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,474
No...

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,410
Out of nowhere... We're neck-deep in problems...

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,336
You or me?

23
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:39,881
You're not as bad as on the telly.

24
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:44,246
You're not as bad as I thought either.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,830
The war between our nations has claimed many lives...

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,790
But much more importantly... It's exposed cold-blooded blood ties.

27
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,443
You've been nattering away with our enemy and you say he's worried?

28
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,150
Don't they suffer all the same?

29
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,857
You're a good man, Vishal...

30
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,830
We're sworn enemies, Vishal! Never forget that!

31
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,490
We kill a few, they kill a few!

32
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,986
Don't even think about her!

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,820
It's gone on for decades past, it'll go on for decades more... Isn't it time someone ended this blood feud?
