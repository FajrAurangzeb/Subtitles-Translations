Episode 18 - 'The Wall'

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,897
Waiting for your go, sir!

22
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,359
Where's Arez?
-I'll find him...

23
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:56,192
Hands behind your head!

24
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,598
I said something! Quick!

25
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,218
Hands behind your head!

26
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,570
You've entered Pakistan. How many men've you got with you?
-No one... I'm just a straggler! I got here by mistake!

27
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,660
You make these mistakes only too often, don't you?

28
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,788
Bloody fools!

29
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,258
Get up...

30
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,251
And keep your hands behind your head!

31
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,171
Vishal Malhotra?

32
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:30,286
Cüneyt Ensar?

33
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,331
How d'you know me?

34
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,172
Same way you know me.

35
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,488
Sarah...

36
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,288
What happened?

37
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:57,970
Tripped and fell...

38
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,788
Got hurt.

39
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,262
Couldn't keep up...

40
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,870
How many men were with you?

41
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,472
Two.

42
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,191
What happens now?

43
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,420
Other end of the river, it's Occupied Kashmir.

44
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,970
You're in the Liberated Kashmir.

45
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,231
First time in two months we've had a ceasefire here...

46
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,544
I'd love to take you with me, or shoot you...

47
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:36,025
But we'd hate to break the ceasefire in just three days...

48
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,346
What d'you want?

49
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:40,546
Eh?

50
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:43,576
In your place...

51
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,926
I'd shoot.

52
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,738
You're Sarah's friend.

53
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,338
I can't shoot you.

54
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,282
Congratulations.

55
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,659
Sarah sent your son's pic.

56
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,750
Gotta say, he's cute...

57
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,289
Get up.

58
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,388
On your feet!

59
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,100
Turn around and get back where you came from. Don't look this way again.

60
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,865
You've got ten seconds...

61
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:44,156
If you ain't outta my sights, I won't think again before filling you with lead!

62
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:46,196
You're lying.

63
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:51,436
You wanna play cat and mouse?

64
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,837
You want me to turn...

65
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:56,087
Run for it...

66
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:59,117
And you want to shoot me in the back...

67
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,916
I've got what it takes to die fighting.

68
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:13,346
One bullet can send us to war again... You've got ten seconds to avoid it.

69
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:18,627
I've been here, collecting the bodies of my fallen brothers... And civvies...

70
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:22,390
Men and women... Young and old...

71
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,917
Kids... Including one newborn baby...

72
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:28,922
I've been doing the same.

73
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:33,108
Why d'you only see your dead?

74
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,778
Don't we <i>all</i> see only our dead?

75
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:38,670
If I shot you...

76
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,008
It'd add one more...

77
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,843
And I'll get promoted for it... Perhaps even a medal...

78
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,580
But the flames which seem to settle...

79
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,467
Will rage again...

80
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,747
The count would keep increasing...

81
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,438
We're soldiers...

82
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:04,080
We sign up for this. We're ready to die fighting.

83
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,490
But know what, I've realised something since the birth of my son...

84
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,451
Not everyone's born to die like this...

85
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,297
So, you've got ten seconds...

86
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,816
Run for your life.

87
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:26,493
Unbelievable...

88
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,523
A Pakistani soldier with a heart...

89
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,103
A Pakistani soldier with a heart... Sparing me?

90
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:35,297
Sparing the enemy?

91
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,490
Even when you know me and Sarah --

92
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,828
Even when you know me and Sarah --
-Sarah told me you're the man of the house... The only son...

93
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:45,488
Sarah told me you're the man of the house... The only son...

94
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:48,789
You've only got women in your family...

95
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:53,499
Life's hard for women. Here and there.

96
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,028
I care for Sarah. That's why.

97
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,378
I'm sure you care for your mother and sisters...

98
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,017
So... Run for them.

99
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,110
Go.

100
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,289
Ten!

101
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,820
Soldier!

102
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,341
NINE!

103
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:06,413
EIGHT!

104
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,468
SEVEN!

105
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,690
He's in our sights, sir... We got him.

106
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,271
Just clear the way and I'll put a bullet in his head.

107
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,540
If you don't, he's gonna get away through the woods!

108
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,254
Okay.

109
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,349
Was he not the best?

110
00:11:45,349 --> 00:11:47,794
No doubt!

111
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,247
SIX!

112
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,988
First time in two months we've had a ceasefire here...

113
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:13,870
One bullet can send us to war again... You've got ten seconds to avoid it.

114
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,878
Cüneyt!

115
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,229
Our sniper's got you in his sights!

116
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,111
He's gonna shoot you...

117
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:36,950
Stay right behind me and get out of here!

118
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,698
Go!

119
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,670
Stop firing, damn it!

Vishal sent me his picture...

138
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,757
He's got your eyes...

139
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:35,017
Your face...

140
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:40,414
These things change...

141
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:43,197
That's what they all say...

142
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,571
I think he's taken after Cüneyt.

143
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,540
You know, Vishal once told me...

144
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,090
'Mum'...

145
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:05,021
'Don't wear white again'...

146
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:07,881
'It doesn't suit you'...

147
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,971
His Dad didn't like it either...

148
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,552
They don't have it there, do they?

149
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:20,722
White for widows...

150
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:24,433
What's it matter?

151
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:30,613
Everything's dark - black - after Cüneyt...

152
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:35,315
You love him so much...

153
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,341
You didn't even mention Vishal's name...

154
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:48,061
Cüneyt's the only one you talk about...

155
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,400
I can't bring myself to say his name...

156
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,657
Or hear it... Please don't mention him...

157
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:58,279
I can't do it...

158
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,859
I'm his mother...

159
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,838
I thought I'd see you...

160
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,289
Somewhere else...

161
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,690
We can't go to each other's countries...

162
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,647
Until...

163
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:30,007
This Kartarpore Accord...

164
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,340
I didn't expect to see you here...

165
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:41,061
How could I turn you down?

166
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,638
Because... I'm Vishal's Mum...

167
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,520
That's who...

168
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,488
I'm here to see...

169
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,698
Give me your hand.

170
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,877
C'mon.

171
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,450
I'd kept this for my daughter-in-law...

172
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,518
Sarah...

173
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,409
When Vishal found out...

174
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:19,590
You're getting married...

175
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,911
I can't live without her, Mum...

176
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,090
He came to me...

177
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,985
He came to me...
-I don't mind converting... If that's all, I don't...

178
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:27,072
I don't mind converting... If that's all, I don't...

179
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:30,972
It ain't just about religion...

180
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:34,300
It's about our countries... There's this wall... Of sunshine...

181
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,110
That just refuses to come down! So I'm sorry, Vishal...

182
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,870
I lost her when I enlisted, Mum...

183
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:46,491
Just -- Let me stop her -- Talk to her once...

184
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:49,991
I know she's waiting for me... She'll be mine if she saw me --
-No...

185
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:53,563
No... Don't even think about it...

186
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:00,870
Your 'love'... It's nothing! Nations... Religion... Whatever... It can never be!

187
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,690
I hear these things at the Academy all day! Please don't start it here!

188
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,280
Please!

189
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,822
Why can't <i>you</i> say love is greater than everything?

190
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:14,260
All these walls come down when love strikes them...

191
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,010
And when they do... Everyone wins...

192
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,628
But in war... Everyone loses...

193
00:20:20,628 --> 00:20:25,128
Just once, Mum --
-No, Vishal... Don't call her... Don't give her hope...

194
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:30,500
Don't make a promise you can't keep... For my sake, Vishal...
-Please, Mum...

195
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,329
Just... Forget her...

196
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,539
Just... Think she never existed...

197
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,859
He was right...

198
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:22,499
I was waiting...

199
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,930
He only had to call out my name...
