Episode 13 - 'Bridging the Gap'

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,800
The Unit sent someone...

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,004
That's why...

23
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,623
They got hold of me...

24
00:01:36,623 --> 00:01:42,058
Beat me -- And threatened never to complai --
-No...

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,865
We're not filing any complaint...

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,858
Just --

27
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:52,104
Forget the estate...

28
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,315
What's it matter?

29
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:57,239
I warned you, Mum...

30
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,808
You're risking my son's life for it!

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,075
Tell Pratibha she can have all of it... If she can throw them out!

32
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:11,616
She can call Anurag or anyone else she wants... Just -- Keep my son out of it.

33
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:13,293
Mum...

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,910
We don't give up like that...

35
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,958
I don't want anything...

36
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,814
I can give up anything...

37
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,830
But...

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,383
Not my boy...

39
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,743
Hear that?

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,580
I don't care about anything else...

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,255
Mum...

42
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,480
Hmm?

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,044
When'd you gather the courage to say no to Aunt?

44
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:04,926
Stop embarrassing me already...

45
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:10,919
What's embarrassing about it? You've been brave...

46
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,853
I just did as someone told me...

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,368
Whoa...

48
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:21,418
Wonder who it is you listen to so much.

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,923
Vishal's Mum.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,106
She said I should not give them anything... Because it's all yours...

51
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:36,196
You told her about it?

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,853
She's the only one who could understand...

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,368
I thought you'd never talk to her again...

54
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:49,750
No, I do... Quite often, actually.

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,797
What d'you talk about?

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,689
You all...

57
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,180
And those...

58
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,827
We've lost...

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,240
Our lives...

60
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,970
That have become...

61
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,692
Unrecognisable...

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,630
Tell your Mum I said thanks.

63
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,837
For?

64
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:44,942
Doing us a great favour.

65
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:49,972
Mum refused to give Aunt the money... We didn't have to say a thing.

66
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:56,110
Funny thing she isn't nearly this brave herself.

67
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,261
Your Mum's very brave. Braver than mine. And strong.

68
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:04,486
She's my Mum...

69
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,932
I know her strengths...

70
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,154
And weaknesses.

71
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,265
What happened?

72
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,980
You sound worried...

73
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,103
Something going on over there... With your Aunt?

74
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,966
Some folks...

75
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,926
Abducted me...

76
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,496
Today...

77
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:29,797
Vishal...

78
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,120
If you're having a Turkish... Lemme tell you it sounds cheap.

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,815
I'm not havin' a Turkish...

80
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,157
The bloke staying at Granny's estate... He sent them...

81
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:45,920
They beat me real bad...

82
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,410
And released me...

83
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,960
Does it hurt?

84
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,192
Not my body...

85
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,047
As much as...

86
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:02,833
The Army esteem and all...

87
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,250
You were crying the other day...

88
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,338
When someone harassed you...

89
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:12,365
You said how they could do that...

90
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:14,810
To a hero's daughter...

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,841
Between the punches...

92
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:22,636
That's what I thought too...

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,795
My father died protecting them...

94
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,960
Can we talk on Skype?

95
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,349
You don't call me on Skype... Why today?

96
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,988
Just felt like it...

97
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,947
Jaysus, Pratibha...

98
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:53,670
Don't try it with me...

99
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,960
I'm serious...

100
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,467
They got Vishal for real...

101
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,140
They beat him real bad and left him here...

102
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,620
You know how it is with the politicians here...

103
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,882
Your brother was a soldier...

104
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:10,592
Isn't the Army gonna do anything for his family?

105
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,582
No idea...

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,076
Mum talked to the Unit. Then this happened.

107
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:23,636
I won't take this bullshit.

108
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,834
I'm suing her if she doesn't give you your share.

109
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,722
What about me?

110
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,288
What am I gonna do?

111
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,178
Get a lawyer.

112
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,805
Send her a notice.

113
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,660
I'll book you a ticket...

114
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,512
When you send me a copy.

115
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,512
Take a good look.

116
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:06,884
It ain't that bad.

117
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,634
That's what you wanted to see, yes?

118
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,634
That's what you wanted to see, yes?
-It looks bad...

119
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:13,705
It looks bad...

120
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,450
They've beat you real bad...

121
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,354
I'll be fine.

122
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,730
Don't worry.

123
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,399
Did you tell the police?

124
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,720
What good is it?
-They could be worse next time.

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,069
What about your family? Your Mum? Care to think?

126
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,944
When they tore my shirt...

127
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:40,842
Punched and pushed me around...

128
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,364
It...

129
00:08:42,364 --> 00:08:46,640
Punched a hole...

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,051
In my love for the nation...

131
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:51,477
I was wondering...

132
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,953
Why we fight for <i>them</i>...

133
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:56,831
When this is how they reward us...

134
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,221
I wish I could do something for you...

135
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,157
Like what?

136
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:09,270
Anything that'd ease your pain...

137
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,421
I ain't a doctor yet, but... I would've tried...

138
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,134
Alright...

139
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,201
I'm sending you a text...

140
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,430
I hope you won't mind it...

141
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,425
After what you've gone through...

142
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:31,685
I wouldn't dare... Not today...

143
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,316
'Wow, you're lovely'

144
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:16,340
'And you're very... Average,
And aye... I'mlovely. So ??'

145
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:49,214
Calm down, Parbhu...

146
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:53,410
Be patient...

147
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:57,360
And wait a while...

148
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,758
I knew you ain't gonna give me my share just like that...

149
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:08,735
But... 'They've taken over the estate?' Wow, that's a new low! Way to ruin my marriage!

150
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:11,197
What are you saying, Aunt?

151
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:15,299
It's Granny's estate. You can have all of it if that's what she wants. We won't mind.

152
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,422
Why'd she give me all of it? Aye?

153
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:22,296
You're the only one who matters to her... She's gonna treat you like a king.

154
00:11:22,296 --> 00:11:29,030
This is unacceptable Mum... I'm going straight to a lawyer... He's gonna sort you out!

155
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,276
Lemme see how long you can hold on to your Aunt's share!

156
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,718
Canny believe...

157
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:49,171
Me own daughter...

158
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:54,175
Is threatenin' me wi' a lawsuit!

159
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,865
And -- He's your martyred brother's son!

160
00:12:05,865 --> 00:12:08,752
Cut the emotional blackmail already...

161
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:11,090
I'm sick of it!

162
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:16,950
I'll make an example of you! Anurag's got friends in the media...

163
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,140
I'll tell the world how you've usurped my share!

164
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,579
Thank goodness you're here, Sunanda...

165
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,685
What's this?

166
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,920
What's this cheque?

167
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:46,829
Your share.

168
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,250
Go and ask Anurag to do the numbers if you don't trust us.

169
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,376
Now... You've got no right over it...

170
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,937
I've called my lawyer...

171
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:00,990
He'll be here with the papers...

172
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,946
For your signatures...

173
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,145
C'mon, Vishal...

174
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,956
She's the only one who cares! I knew it!

175
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,839
That's all I ever asked for! Big deal!

176
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:15,767
Vishal?

177
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,370
Well, I guess everything's sorted out...

178
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,590
Mum?

179
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:45,050
We thought we'd come here the moment we found out Colonel Sherali's family lives next door!

180
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,466
It is a great honour indeed.

181
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,976
Of course...

182
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:54,194
To live in the company of heroes...

183
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:57,182
Is a great honour indeed...

184
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,066
Is he in the Army too? Your son.

185
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:05,015
Aye, he's a Captain.

186
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:08,008
On his second assignment here.

187
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,538
How many kids d'you have?

188
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:15,750
Cüneyt and his younger sister...

189
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,145
She's gotten engaged by the way.

190
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,876
Hey...

191
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,870
Hello...

192
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,948
My daughter, Sarah.

193
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,314
Bless her...

194
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,421
She's lovely.

195
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:33,140
She's the eldest...

196
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,135
She just got into medical college.

197
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,600
Come here, will you?

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,219
Sure.

199
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,007
My daughter's in medical college too.

200
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,950
She's doing her House Job.

201
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,739
Great. Where?

202
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:54,060
Fatima Jinnah Medical College.

203
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,466
That's where I study too!

204
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:01,341
Meet our new neighbours.

205
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,566
I saw them when they got here...

206
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:10,642
You gotta attend my daughter's wedding.

207
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:12,903
I'll be waiting.

208
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:14,693
Sure.

209
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:17,623
Why not?
-We'll be there.

210
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,060
You know, it's such a pleasure to finally meet you...

211
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,230
Yeah?

212
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,114
I followed you on social media.

213
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:40,270
Back when your father lost his life... And you stood your ground against the Indian Colonel's kid... You may've missed it, but I was right there by your side, supporting you.

214
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,640
Well...

215
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,170
It was very childish, to be honest... But thank you...

216
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,117
Childish? Not at all.

217
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:50,630
In fact, whatever you said made quite a lot of sense.

218
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,010
I mean, he was making such a moron of himself.

219
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,061
He didn't seem to have anything to say, really.

220
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,967
You're a soldier?

221
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,573
Aye.

222
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,549
How'd you guess?

223
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,695
The way you talk...

224
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:10,032
I thought it's my haircut.

225
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:14,037
Your haircut ain't nearly as big a giveaway.

226
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:18,972
Well, what else d'you expect from a military man?

227
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,664
I think...

228
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,121
I'll get going...

229
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:26,886
See you soon?

230
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,150
Good. At least no one's gonna claim the estate for himself.

231
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,839
Hmm...

232
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,740
I was sick of it...

233
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,610
Wanted to get rid of it...

234
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,783
I mean, what if something happened to Vishal?

235
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,018
Good. That's one thing sorted out. Let's move on to the next...

236
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,100
Please, Raj... I told you already!

237
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,196
You know I won't give up. I'll keep waiting.

238
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:04,439
How long d'you want me to wait?

239
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,725
I don't know. Can't say. No idea.

240
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,752
I've got little kids... A young son...

241
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,817
And you're proposing to me?

242
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:17,453
I've got a son too.
-You're a man...

243
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,470
Your morals won't be policed like mine.

244
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,593
You really disappoint me, mate...

245
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:32,100
No idea why but... I feel so weak... After Vijay...

246
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,897
I can make you strong again.

247
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,193
Aye?

248
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,100
Yeah, Granny?

249
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,403
You busy?

250
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:59,260
Aye...

251
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,215
Applying to a few Universities...

252
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,174
Vishal...

253
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:32,063
Yeah?

254
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,722
Why don't you apply to the Army?

255
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,123
But -- Didn't you never want me to join the Army?

256
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,663
I've changed my mind.

257
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,480
But -- I don't want to join the Army...

258
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,411
Never wanted to. You know it.

259
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,324
So...

260
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,549
Your grandfather...

261
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,930
Chose the Army life for himself...

262
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,901
As did your father...

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,728
They...

264
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:29,662
Didn't need to...

265
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,990
But you...

266
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,023
Yer nade ter choose dis Army life... For yerself... An' for us...

267
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,056
A uniform...

268
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:04,454
Makes lions of men...

269
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:10,110
Life in this part of the world...

270
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,879
Is difficult...

271
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:16,441
Without a lion around...

272
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,030
The last few months...

273
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:33,879
'Av killed any love Oi 'ad for dis nashun...

274
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,917
First time...

275
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,763
First time Ah've felt...

276
00:20:45,763 --> 00:20:50,520
A love for their nashun...

277
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,680
Isn't de only tin' dat makes soldiers...

278
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,750
Ah've been blind...

279
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,811
Ter everythin' else dat pushes tren...

280
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,070
But...

281
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,332
No longer...

282
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,039
After your father died...

283
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,932
Vishal...

284
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,377
At my age...

285
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:29,406
I'm not sure how much life there is left in me...

286
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,397
But you...

287
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:38,864
You've got responsibility... Pari, Laxmi... And Sunanda... They need you...

288
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:44,726
They need you to forget everything else...

289
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,007
I --

290
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,483
What if --

291
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,861
I'll tell Sunanda.

292
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,789
Apply to the Army.

293
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,452
We'll tell Sunanda...

294
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:01,285
Once you're selected...

295
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,881
You're late...

296
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,899
I went --

297
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,050
For lunch -- With this friend...

298
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,938
Sunanda...

299
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,608
Thank you.

300
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,818
You've done me a 'uge favour.

301
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,488
It wasn't a favour...

302
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,198
It was my duty.

303
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,138
That's weird...

304
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:48,898
Telling me never to do it, but giving your SIL the money right away?

305
00:23:48,898 --> 00:23:52,178
The situation was completely different, Amna...

306
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:56,958
She was asking for a loan... And <i>she</i> just wanted her share.

307
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,919
Hardly different...

308
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,890
You gave her the compensation you got.

309
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,382
Every penny of it.

310
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,748
Vijay...

311
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,359
Was very attached to the estate...

312
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,159
Every brick is a walk down the memory lane.

313
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:19,781
Vijay's gone... I couldn't do anything about it...

314
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:24,922
What'd be left of him for Vishal if we lost the estate?

315
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:28,580
I just saved his memory... For Vishal...

316
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,870
Vishal and his Granny must've been thankful...

317
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:40,109
Aye... First time she seemed worried that I was late...

318
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,858
But, to be honest... These things hardly matter now...

319
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,288
I understand...

320
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:52,278
But who cares if it 'matters'?

321
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,568
Someone's...

322
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:02,338
Proposed to me...

323
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,595
You?

324
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,134
Yeah. I don't know why I'm telling you, but...

325
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,864
Who?

326
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,594
An old friend...

327
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:17,175
From college...

328
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,396
But...

329
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:21,487
I was only ever interested in Vijay.

330
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,848
He left for America. Got married.

331
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:28,890
He's back now that he's divorced... Saw me a few days back...

332
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,458
That's when he proposed...

333
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,270
What are you thinking?
-What d'you think?

334
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,100
I've got three kids! Including a young lad!

335
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,581
How long's it been since Vijay left us?

336
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:46,552
How can I even think of it?

337
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,980
You refused?

338
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,005
Again and again...

339
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:57,677
But he's been calling again and again... And saying the same thing...

340
00:25:57,731 --> 00:26:02,511
I guess there's nothing wrong in thinking about it.

341
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:05,882
What'd you do in my place?

342
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,200
It's no use.

343
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,748
We're all in our own set of circumstances... We face different choices...

344
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:19,778
If you think it can work out well, you should give it a thought.

345
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,061
It ain't as easy as you think...

346
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,110
I know...

347
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,740
But...

348
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,100
We're different, you and I...

349
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,026
You're an independent working woman... Unlike me...

350
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,591
What about my son? He's a young man now!

351
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,435
And he'll be lost in his own world very soon...

352
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,280
You'll be all alone once he starts college...

353
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,868
I'll still have Pari and Laxmi.

354
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,988
In your place... I'd still give it a thought...

355
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,820
Especially...

356
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,630
After everything I've gone through in the last few months...

357
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,958
Everything's changed...

358
00:27:06,518 --> 00:27:07,960
Feels like...

359
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,922
I'm...

360
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,493
All alone...

361
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:17,561
You don't always need a companion who can take someone's place...

362
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:20,750
Just one...

363
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,455
Who can fill the void...

364
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,841
Who you're not alone with...

365
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,979
Did Aunt call?

366
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,359
After she left for Canada?

367
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,088
Why'd she call us nigh?

368
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,889
She wanted 'er share...

369
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:19,820
She got it.

370
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,981
End av scayle.

371
00:28:22,171 --> 00:28:26,331
I've applied to the Army, by the way.

372
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,138
Aren't you happy?

373
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,319
Sarah?

374
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,167
Can I talk to her?

375
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,037
Gotta apologise ter someone... Mind?

376
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:10,880
Aye...

377
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,581
You got back <i>so</i> quickly, Nawab...

378
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:19,580
Told you about the wedding...

379
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,681
You remember everything after you get there, don't you? Repairs, wedding, and all...

380
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,298
Could you give me the spoon?

381
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,470
Blend these nicely, okay? I'll be back...

382
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,378
Hello?

383
00:29:51,378 --> 00:29:52,350
Hello.

384
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,160
Sorry I didn't call you. Thought you'd be busy.

385
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,311
I'm making a cake!

386
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,800
Uh...

387
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:03,545
Granny wants to talk...

388
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,000
Your Granny?

389
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,040
Why?

390
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,851
No idea. Find out yourself. Here...

391
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,878
Hello?

392
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:17,142
Hello...
-Sarah...

393
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:19,323
How are you, love?

394
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,181
Great... And you?

395
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,489
I -- I'm fine, dear...

396
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,670
I...

397
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,475
I wanted to say sorry...

398
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,880
Oi said a lot Oi shouldn't 'av...

399
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:45,058
It's okay... I get it... My Granny and Grandpa react the same way too, sometimes...

400
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,638
Would you like to talk to Granny?

401
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,309
Why not?

402
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,548
Vishal's Granny... Wants to talk to you...

403
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,158
Why?

404
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,828
What've you done this time?

405
00:30:57,828 --> 00:31:01,540
Why does she want to talk to me? She in the mood to pick another row?

406
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,138
Why does she want to talk to me? She in the mood to pick another row?
-Just -- Talk to her once?

407
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,718
Just -- Talk to her once?

408
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,670
Aye?
-Hello...

409
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:17,742
Hello...

410
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,260
I...

411
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,611
Wanted to say sorry...

412
00:31:22,611 --> 00:31:24,693
For everything...

413
00:31:24,693 --> 00:31:27,863
I said that day...

414
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,510
Aye...

415
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,145
That's what I told Sarah's Grandpa...

416
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:37,776
We said a lot we shouldn't have...

417
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,387
They're kids...

418
00:31:39,387 --> 00:31:40,727
Big deal...

419
00:31:40,727 --> 00:31:43,730
But we should know better than act like kids!

420
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,680
Absolutely...

421
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,889
Me emoshuns got de better av me...

422
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:56,568
Oi'm sure yer understan'... Losin' Vijay 'as been most painful...

423
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,747
Aye...

424
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,948
You're telling me...

425
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:07,300
Sherali left us all grieving...

426
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,478
They lef...

427
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:12,688
Too young...

428
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:16,260
If anyone should've gone, 'tis us...

429
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,088
Aye...

430
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:26,347
That's what I think too... May God never make parents live to see the deaths of their children...

431
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:29,317
Me warrld feels... Empty...

432
00:32:29,317 --> 00:32:31,788
Nothing's ever felt de seem...

433
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:34,819
Since Vijay's death...

434
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,048
Of course... He was at the border...

435
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,908
But we knew...

436
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:44,519
He was there... He was alright...

437
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,380
Even as he put his life on the line...

438
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,709
Where in Pakistan are you from, by the way?

439
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,383
Me?

440
00:32:55,383 --> 00:32:57,637
I'm from Lahore.

441
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:00,767
Sarah's Grandpa's from Amritsar though.

442
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:02,757
Amritsar?

443
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,921
