Episode 1 - 'India vs Pakistan - Who Won This?'

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,215
In the air...

22
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,973
That's one wicket down!

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,296
And he gets the runs!

24
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,043
This might go over the boundary...

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,665
Brilliant shot, innit? Can he catch it?

26
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,961
Another one through the air...
-Yeah!

27
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,910
Yes!

28
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,177
And he does it again!

29
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,958
Another one in the air!

30
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,595
Another brilliant shot!

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,010
Good shot...

32
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,120
Has he taken it?

33
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,540
Very comfortably!
-Ye --

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,650
Very comfortably!
-Yuck!
-No...

35
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,712
Woo hoo!

36
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:46,973
They can't even play decently...

37
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,035
Not again...

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:02,040
That's why I never like these matches! They're always up to something else!

39
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,459
Don't worry. I'm praying for Pakistan's victory...

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,710
Are you gonna pussyfoot around the whole time? C'mon, sit down.

41
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:19,300
It's okay, Mum... I know we got this one.
-Of course...

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:24,620
I swear I'm gonna offer all my prayers if Pakistan won this!

43
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,200
And I'm gonna thank Him all day, all night!

44
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,870
Don't worry, we've been wipin' de floor wi' dem for de last 7 matches.
-Aye.

45
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,990
You're jist gettin' worried, that's al'.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,098
Alright...

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,100
Separate them out, okay?

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,828
Give them all space to grow, okay?
-Okay.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,230
In the name of God, the Most Generous, the Most Merciful...

50
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,750
He - the Most Generous and Merciful, the Lord of the worlds - deserves all praise...

51
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,630
The Lord of the Day of Judgement...

52
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:18,460
We pray to You alone, and ask for Your help. Show us the path of righteousness...

53
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,038
Jesus, late again...

54
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,920
Breakfast for Grandma, Grandpa... The kids...

55
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,500
Nadir? Done yet? How long are you gonna need? You're getting late!

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,810
And how long do <i>you</i> need?
-Not hungry, Mum...

57
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,890
C'mon, have your breakfast!
-I always do... Just -- Today...

58
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,870
Where's my breakfast, Uncle Nawab?
-Just a second, ma'am!

59
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,985
(Here we go again...)

60
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,995
Just a sec...

61
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,240
Here.

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,330
Hey.
-Don't leave before you've had breakfast!

63
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,800
Can't you put that book down for a minute, Sarah?
-I'm getting late!

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Then get up early!

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,660
At least let them --
-I'm getting late, Mum! Very late!

66
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,510
Take care, Granny... Don't forget to pray.

67
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,860
Of course, it's your last paper...

68
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,710
I'm talking about the match with India!
-See you.

69
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,160
Take care.
-See you, Mum!
-Have something in break time! See you. Don't forget anything you need!
-See you!

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,300
Quickly!
-Pray for me.
-In the car, quick!
-See you, Grandpa!
-Take care!

71
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,988
Bye!

72
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,110
Hail Lord Ganesha...

73
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,110
Son of God -- dess Parvati and Mahadeva...

74
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,520
Hail Lord Ganesha...

75
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,490
Out!
-Not out!
-Okay...

76
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:24,040
Hail Lord Ganesha...

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,863
Calm down!

78
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,127
What d'you think you're doing?

79
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,496
Doing an Atif Aslam...?

80
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,896
Yer nu oi pray dis time.

81
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:53,900
But what'd you care?

82
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,969
Alwus interruptin' me... Be done wi' it!
-Sorry...

83
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,180
By the way -- Don't forget to pray, Granny -- The match...
-Yeah, oi nu.

84
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,414
Out!
-Gopi!

85
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,470
(Here... Granny needs me...) Yes?

86
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,997
Here.

87
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,755
Vijay didn't call today...

88
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:20,890
Yeah... He didn't.

89
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,484
Weord...

90
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,380
He texted he'd call me...

91
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,008
Just a bit late...

92
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,740
Anyway, I'll have my breakfast...

93
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,453
Okay.

94
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,057
Nawab!

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Nawab!

96
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:48,220
Where's the remote? Everyone knows I watch this drama on telly...

97
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,246
Nawab...
-Ma'am?

98
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:50,840
Where's the remote?

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,580
I kept it here when I cleaned it... Let me have a look...

100
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,670
Where could it be?

101
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,720
Ah yes, Grandpa was watching the news... Here!

102
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,780
Yeah, turn it on.
-Geo News live with an exclusive...

103
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,780
D'you watch Pakistani plays, Shefali?

104
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,830
Totally love them!
-Same here! Love the plays, love the wardrobe, the acting...

105
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,390
I mean, check out their elegant suits!
-Aye.

106
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:27,200
Don't forget the dialogues! A real story, some content... And the performances...

107
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,090
I swear! Nothing like our plays!

108
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:38,030
Can't believe you're comparing them with our plays! Ridiculous stories... Just think of -- 'The Serpent'!

109
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,529
Enjoying 'The Serpent' again, eh?

110
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,890
Oh, please, not again... Why don't you have a chat with your friends or something? Lemme watch it...

111
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,600
Can't believe you went from reading the Holy Qur'an to watching this reincarnated soap opera in minutes.

112
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,880
No way you'll be forgiven for this!

113
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,617
There now, it's just a drama... Let me enjoy it.

114
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,820
Anyway, when's Vijay coming back?
-In two weeks!

115
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,870
Thank goodness he's done with that hardship post... I was really worried about that.

116
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,840
That explains the lively face...

117
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,450
Counting down, too, I figure!

118
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,640
Because why not!

119
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,656
I've been marking the days on the calendar...

120
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:31,080
And how's your MIL?

121
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,030
Don't even ask... She's never gonna change...

122
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,113
But with a husband like Vijay, who cares?

123
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,370
Anyway, I gotta go... I had no idea I've spent so much time with you!

124
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,720
Big day today, by the way. Everyone's feverish!

125
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,170
The ladies' club's showing the match. Want to come with me?
-No...

126
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,992
I'd rather watch at home.

127
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:57,910
India's gonna win this one.

128
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,020
Would you say the same if... Fawad Khan were on the Pakistani team?

129
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,808
'Course not.

130
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,965
Check out this step!

131
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,620
Lovely. So you were dancing to this song!
-Yeah. But Mum told me to stop and get back to studies...

132
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,000
Anushka's dress though!

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,376
Everything she wears suits her! She looks soooo lovely!
-I know! She's amazing!

134
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,067
I think it's the driver...

135
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:29,203
Yeah. C'mon.

136
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:38,600
By the way... Don't forget to pray for Pakistan's victory. If we win this one, I'm celebrating for a week! Besides, I'm done with my exams!

137
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,810
Don't worry. We got this one.

138
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,680
Really?
-Yeah.

139
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,370
God help us win this one...

140
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,539
Do we have any half-decent players left?

141
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,990
Yes... Quite a lot of them, this time.

142
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,320
We haven't lost any matches in the last few months...

143
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,040
That's what worries me, sir!

144
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,200
We can't keep at anything for more than a few months!

145
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,240
The Asian theatre's showing the match here. Indians and Pakistanis flock together.

146
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,032
Brace yerself for a proper brawl!

147
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:29,840
That's not how it is here, Mum... We enjoy it together. Congratulate each other or say 'Better luck next time'. Simple, innit?

148
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:38,920
Canny believe 'oy simply yer forgot yisser country whaen yer moved ter Canada! Yer got ter be ready ter scrap... Or die for yisser country!

149
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:45,210
We're all cogs in the machine here... Too busy with work... Working together...

150
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:50,750
In the middle of all of this, a familiar face is all you need...

151
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,870
'Sup, Granny! Hey, Aunt!
-M'boy!
-Hi, Vishal!

152
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,790
Ready for the match?

153
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,310
Not like you. I hear you've stockpiled fireworks!

154
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,880
Nah, I'm about to... Too expensive these days... But I'll find some today! I've got just... Thirteen or so?

155
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,020
Thirteen? I hear that right? Just -- Why? It's so unlucky!

156
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,180
Aye, why unlucky thirteen?

157
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,860
Okay, I'll get some more for luck... Bye, Aunt!

158
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,640
Mum!

159
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,460
Make sure the biryani, quorma, and fruit chat are ready for dinner.

160
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,840
And pakoras... Samosas... Everything!
-Gee... Sounds like someone aced her paper...

161
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,510
'Course... Just hope the team aces this match too!

162
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:44,248
You're at it again! I made these for Noria. Put them down.

163
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:49,790
You don't make anything for me, do you? It's always for Noria or Nadir...

164
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,170
That's why I miss Dad so much... He's the only one who cares for me.

165
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:59,930
It's nothing... Just... Cooking rice...
-I'm starving, Mum...
-D'you think we can win this match, ma'am?

166
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,458
I hope so!

167
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,173
Likewise.

168
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,554
Aye?

169
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,442
Oh yeah?

170
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,260
Okay. I'll tell Mum and be there... 4-ish? 5 at the most!

171
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,080
Yeah, I'll be there.

172
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,340
Why d'you have to go anywhere when you can watch the match with us?

173
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,464
This isn't just any match, Mum...

174
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,980
Your Grandma's never gonna let you go.

175
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,110
Your Dad's not here either. I can't let you go.

176
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,640
I'm not a kid, Mum.

177
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,260
Oh yeah? You better mature too. See some sense. You're gonna be out until so late!

178
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,090
They're friends, Mum... You know them all.

179
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,023
Jesus, the wretch gave me this empty box!

180
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:15,940
Look, Vishal... You're free to do as you want... But if you're asking me, I ain't letting you go. Call and ask Dad if you've got a problem.

181
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,710
Dad's in Kashmir! You don't seriously expect me to call him for this --
-I do.

182
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,719
Every single time -- Forget it...

183
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,950
Noria! When's the match?

184
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,204
Again? You just asked me five minutes ago! Can't you wait?

185
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:45,400
When do I ask again?

186
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:52,160
How 'bout... Never? Just go and see for yourself on the telly!

187
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,152
Noria! Don't!

188
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,323
Please, c'mon!

189
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,032
Here we go, this is Pakistan!

190
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,300
Yeah!
-Woo hoo!
-We've won!

191
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,700
Victory!
-YAYYY!!
-Victory!

192
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:31,620
Everyone here! Granny?
-Yay!
-Hooray!
-Granny!

193
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,940
I've been twattling on all day, but you had to watch the match here! What d'you care what I say?

194
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,930
Hooray!
-Win win for India!
-Yeehaw!

195
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,117
Woo hoo!

196
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,810
Pari, Laxmi... Come with me!
-Yeah, c'mon! Let's go!

197
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,590
I got the lighter.
-Which one goes first? Hey, not so fast!

198
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,010
Hey, not so fast! C'mon!

199
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,030
Can't believe I missed another episode of 'The Serpent' for this!

200
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,922
Don't you dare talk about anything Indian!

201
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,092
I can't believe it...

202
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:25,187
Again...?

203
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,916
I hate cricket!

204
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:30,700
Noria...

205
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,606
Go freshen up... Both of you... It's late...

206
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,950
What was I thinking? Preparing for a feast...

207
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,766
C'mon...

208
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,752
Nawab!

209
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,103
All our hopes...

210
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:53,164
Go and see who's here!

211
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,660
Nawab!

212
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,614
Nawab?

213
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,087
Who is it?
-Grandpa...

214
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,880
Who is it, Gopi?

215
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:21,930
I wanna go somewhere that's nice, Grandpa... And I wanna go right now! I've watched enough cricket for this life!

('May the holy land, stay glad' instrumental)

217

Another brave son of Pakistan shall be buried in her soil...

218
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:20,000
Pakistan takes pride in her bravehearts who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for her safety, and their families, their kinsmen they leave behind...

219
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,270
I seek refuge with God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful, from the accursed Satan, and begin in His name...

220
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,530
He is the only One, the eternal Lord...

221
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,050
He was not begotten, nor did he beget... One, like no one else...

222
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:44,600
In the name of the Lord, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful... All praise to Him, the Lord of the worlds and the Day of Judgement, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful...

223
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,110
You alone do we pray to, and ask for help, so show us the righteous path...

224
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:59,763
The path of those who earned Your favour, not the misguided who incurred Your wrath. Amen.

225
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:06,770
Few would've brought the enemy to their knees like Col Vijay Malhotra did in Kashmir.

226
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,910
His funeral rites will start in a few moments.

227

But first, a parting tribute from the people of India to their braveheart...

Was he not the best?

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,151
No doubt!

The officer wants to talk to you...

234
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:55,709
The reporters are here for you.

235
00:21:55,709 --> 00:22:01,770
Tell them about your Dad... And how you're proud to be his daughter...

236
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,030
And... Just how big this day is for you, for us... And for our nation...

237
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,953
And... Just how big this day is for you, for us... And for our nation...
-They've lost their son, but you can see neither tears in the girl's eyes, nor shock on the father's face...

238
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:12,380
They've lost their son, but you can see neither tears in the girl's eyes, nor shock on the father's face...

239
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,728
All of India's watching... We ought to send a message.

240
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:22,193
What would our hero's son want to tell Pakistan?

241
00:22:22,193 --> 00:22:28,920
How'd you tell them that every one of us is willing to fight and die for our motherland?

242
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm -- Very proud -- of my father... Col Vijay Malhotra...

243
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:44,500
My father, Col Sherali, is the first martyr in our family... And I'm proud to be his daughter. Few are so fortunate...

244
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:53,010
My husband - Kamlesh Malhotra - was a soldier too... He did everything he could for his nation...

245
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:59,900
The nation gave him life... And in return...

246
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,230
He gave his life for it...

247
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:07,380
We're all... Very proud...

248
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:14,940
That Dad... Crushed our enemies... Even in his last breaths...

249
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,690
And... Made them suffer!

250
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,120
Something you'd like our enemies to hear?

251
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,215
Just...

252
00:23:25,215 --> 00:23:29,233
Don't even dare come close to our holy land.

253
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:38,860
Our enemies would do well to remember that it won't end with one Vijay Malhotra. There's millions like him who'd gouge every eye that dares look at us the wrong way out!

254
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:45,064
We'd give our nation every last drop of our blood.

255
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,944
Brave girl. Just like your father.

256
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,940
That's the kind of courageous and selfless families our martyrs come from...

257
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,390
We salute the family, the mother, wife, son, and daughter...

258
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:18,310
Who take pride that Col Sherali sacrificed his life defending his homeland, fulfilling the vow he made when he joined the Pakistan Army...

259
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,730
Eyes ablaze, smiling wide, like a true martyr...

260
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,990
With that, we conclude this programme. Next up on India News... (Cut!)

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,995
Hope I didn't mess it up!

Mum? We're home...

Mum?

280
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,889
C'mon...

My back's broken...

286

When's Dad coming back, Mum?

287
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,920
Quickly, Uncle Gopi! I'm starving!

288
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,326
It's all for you...

289
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:22,040
Just give me a minute...

290
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,640
C'mon.

291
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,064
Uncle Gopi...

292
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,604
Why'd they burn Dad?

293
00:28:43,285 --> 00:28:44,762
Vishal...

294
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:47,189
Want to have something?

295
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:50,610
I'm sure you're starving.

296
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,253
No.

297
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,839
Grandpa...

298
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,850
The GOC's here.

299
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,117
C'mon, you can do it... Grandpa.

300
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,694
No longer...

301
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,960
Not at my age...

302
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,050
Not without my son to give me hope...

303
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,870
Of course...

304
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:52,220
We're gonna have another round of the same... Bravery... Courage...

305
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,638
The glories of martyrdom...

306
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:59,635
The same old condolences...

307
00:29:59,635 --> 00:30:04,370
Questions... And answers...

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,430
The Indian Army will always be there for you.

309
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:18,536
It would've been great if I could meet Mrs Malhotra in person... And convey my condolences.

310
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:23,703
She's not feeling well. She took a pill and went to sleep.

311
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,629
Well, then... I'll take your leave.

312
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,805
God bless you, son.

313
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,730
You're still up, Mum?

314
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,650
The sleeping pills don't seem to be working...

315
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,625
Strange, innit?

316
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,360
Doesn't your Dad look so stunning?

317
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,940
He was supposed to come back in a week...

318
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,004
But... Not like this...

319
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,017
H -- Have something?

320
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,314
Why?

321
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,910
You haven't had anything all day.

322
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,227
Mum...

323
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,140
Get some rest...

324
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,793
You're still up?

325
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,110
You're up too.

326
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,668
I'll doze off in a moment...

327
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,114
Go, you need some rest.

328
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,354
Vishal...

329
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,750
Go get some rest... I feel like sitting here for a while...

330
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,500

Col Vijay Malhotra has shown the world that the Indian Army guards this nation like an iron curtain...

349
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,027
Impenetrable no matter how many of us you kill.

350
00:35:54,027 --> 00:36:05,270
We salute the family, the mother, wife, son, and daughter, who take pride in his martyrdom even as they bid him a final goodbye.

351
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,030
Was he not the best?

352
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,780
No doubt!

353
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,820
What would our hero's son want to tell Pakistan?

354
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,300
How'd you tell them that every one of us is willing to fight and die for our motherland?

355
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:28,670
Our enemies would do well to remember that it won't end with one Vijay Malhotra. There's millions like him who'd gouge every eye that dares look at us the wrong way out, and sever every head that dares think about harming us!

356
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,300
That's the spirit, m'lad! We're so proud of you!

357
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:45,549
'Who do these shameless Hindus spare anyway?'
-'Aren't you ashamed of yourself Sara Sherali? Comin' here to bicker! As if your old man didn't disgrace you enough already!'

358
00:36:50,440 --> 00:37:00,190
'That's what you deserve, you wretched cow!'
-'It won't end with your oul fella, Sarah! We're comin' for your entire bloody family!'

359
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:18,490
Not sorry, Indians, but Col Vijay Malhotra was no brave man.

360
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:28,265
Not even nearly as brave as my father, who's gonna be awarded the Military Medal for Gallantry for routing the enemy.

361
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,600
'Who the hell thought it's okay to spare the daughter?'
-'Your father did the right thing, Vishal. India thanks him and stands with your family.'

362
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,600
'Good one. "LoNG LiVe PaKIsTaN." For Christ's sake, you can't even shoot straight!'

363
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:57,940
'Hail India! Hope to see you finishing the fight, Vishal!'

364
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,860
'That's what you bloody deserve, girl!'

365
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:10,939
My father embraced death, fighting the good fight. What can you Indian wretches do except yap online?

366
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,200
Miss Sarah Sherali...

367
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Your manners show the character of your country.

368
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,700
Cowards! That's what you are.

369
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,079
What you've always been.

370
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm Vishal Malhotra... The son of Col Vijay Malhotra...

371
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,030
Who died fighting to protect his country...

372
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:46,390
But not before proving his mettle and crushing your army...

373
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,930
For which, in just a few days, he will be awarded the Victoria Cross.

374
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:57,988
You are most welcome to believe it. Or would you rather want an official invitation?

375
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:11,960
Mr Vishal Mahotra... Admittedly, I feel sorry for your loss...

376
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:21,966
But it appears you've lost your sanity between your grief, which is why you can do no better than shoot your mouth off here!

377
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:36,955
No amount of chest-thumping or gibbering here's gonna prove how brave you are. I'd like to see you bring your old man's regiment here so we can sort it out in a fair fight!

378
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:15,410
Oh, please, just admit we've given you the frights... It's a lot easier... Your old man died a coward's death!

379
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:23,340
That's only because we're ready to fight... And die for our nation. Were it up to you, you would've killed all the minorities in yours!

380
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:35,400
Why don't you care about your blasted failing state instead? In case you forgot what we did with East Pakistan, lemme tell you we're planning a sweet reminder for West Pakistan real soon.

381
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,808
Oh, I'd like to see you try!

382
00:40:39,808 --> 00:40:44,680
Were it so easy, you sissies would've vanquished us long ago!

383
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:56,371
Not sorry, Indians, but Col Vijay Malhotra was no brave man.

384
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,260
Cowards! That's what you are.

385
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,610
What you've always been.

386
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
