Episode 3 - 'Something in the Wreckage'

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,753
... Lt Col Anand Rastogi and his squad are reportedly killed in action.

22
00:01:30,753 --> 00:01:41,614
The nation takes pride in its heroes who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for its sake, and their families who stand strong in their sorrow.

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,102
In other news...

24
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,940
Remember Mukesh?
-Pakistan has resorted to unprovoked firing yet again...

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,166
Pakistan has resorted to unprovoked firing yet again...

26
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,244
That's his Dad...
-Two of our heroes lost their lives in the dastardly attack...

27
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,749
Two of our heroes lost their lives in the dastardly attack...

28
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:59,010
The Pakistani Special Forces reportedly mutilated the bodies beyond recognition...

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,986
One wonders if this is the fine generalship and military discipline that Pakistan takes so much pride in...

30
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:09,775
The fallen heroes' funeral will be held on...

31
00:02:09,775 --> 00:02:19,870
In the ensuing skirmish with India, we have reports that Major Iosef Abidi, Captain Khurram, and Lieutenant Niaz Mohammad lost their lives...

32
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:33,290
I repeat, we're getting reports that Major Iosef Abidi, Captain Khurram, and Lieutenant Niaz Mohammad lost their lives in the skirmish with India...

33
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,373
Remember Hamid Abidi?

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,941
That's his son...

35
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:47,393
And so we bid farewell to Col M. N. Roy, who embraced death in the line of duty in Kashmir...

36
00:02:47,393 --> 00:03:01,520
But not before setting an example that will live on after him. The final farewells from his daughter and the Gorkha Regiment brought us all to tears...

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,278
Hail India!

38
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:05,996
Hail India!
-Hail India!

39
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:06,348
Long

40
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:06,725
Long live

41
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:07,200
Long live India!

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Long live India!
-Again!

43
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,904
Again!
-Long

44
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,193
Again!
-Long live

45
00:03:08,193 --> 00:03:08,600
Again!
-Long live India!

46
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:08,937
Long live India!
-Again!

47
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:09,263
Again!
-Long

48
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:09,583
Again!
-Long live

49
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,123
Again!
-Long live India!

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,310
Sergeant Khalid Mehmood's sacrifice will not be forgotten...

51
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:39,380
Heroes like him will forever give us hope and remind our enemies that death does not scare us...

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,537
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn...

53
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:45,792
At the going down of the sun and in the morning...

54
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,083
We will remember them...

55
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,763
Gotta have a heart of stone to get in the army, eh?
-Perhaps... But not a cruel one.

56
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:10,349
Serving eight months a year in distant lands, I'm not mad to start a row with my wife in my four months here!

57
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:15,709
I've got a lot to learn... Got to be brave.
-Of course. Like a soldier's wife.

58
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:19,620
No less a soldier herself.

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,790
Vishal!

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,683
Granny?

61
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:46,658
Pari and Laxmi haven't gone to school for so long...

62
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:52,000
Ask Sunanda to send them. Get them back up to full speed.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,415
Why don't you talk to Mum?

64
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:59,327
I've told her so many times...

65
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:02,820
No idea...

66
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,830
How I'm gonna say it...

67
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,677
We haven't talked in ages...

68
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:16,893
How do I convince her?

69
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,543
Why don't you try?

70
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:47,870
Major Iosef Abidi's heroism in the face of impossible odds set an example for our nation. We've got with us his widow and mother...

71
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:57,070
Sarah... Just change the channel, will you? And get me my pills, my BP's shooting up...
-Are you alright, Granny?
-Who, with a glowing and a glistening eye...

72
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,005
It's nothing...

73
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,874
Just... Missing Sherali...

74
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:08,566
This kind of news...

75
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,733
Anything...

76
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:15,627
Just opens old wounds...

77
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:19,578
I know...

78
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:23,323
What his mother feels like...

79
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,656
I mean...

80
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:31,636
She'd just got Iosef married last year...

81
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:37,270
She sent sweets for us just a few days back...

82
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,097
When he had a son...

83
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,033
And these heartless journalists...

84
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,450
Want to ask her...

85
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,973
How she feels!

86
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,619
C'mon, school time! Let's go!
-No, we're enjoying ourselves here.

87
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,432
Don't you wanna enjoy with your friends?

88
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:21,247
I've got none.

89
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,435
They ain't the fun sort...

90
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,320
As if you go to school to have fun. Don't you think you should learn something for a change?
-I don't want to.
-I wanna stay at home...

91
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,550
Why?

92
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,978
I'm afraid...

93
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,850
Why?

94
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,350
No idea.

95
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,250
She's lying. She's just waiting for Dad.

96
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,398
When's Dad coming back? Tell him we can see through his trick!

97
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,393
C'mon, now.

98
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,337
What happened?

99
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,818
No idea what's wrong with my legs...

100
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:18,759
I can't get up.

101
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,910
C'mon, try again.

102
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,403
C'mon.

103
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,800
No...

104
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,500
My legs... Feel lifeless...

105
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,715
Amna!

106
00:08:42,805 --> 00:08:44,373
Sarah!

107
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,713
Amna!

108
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:51,560
Get here quickly! Your Grandpa can't get up!

109
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,170
What happened?

110
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,350
What happened?
-Dad?

111
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,866
Grandpa?

112
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,210
Just... Can't get up... My legs feel weak...

113
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,334
Call the unit. Get someone. We need to see a doctor!

114
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,799
Hey, mate.
-Hey.

115
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,892
You comin' on the school trip?
-There's a school trip?

116
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,825
Yeah?

117
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,420
I'm sorry, I can't...
-Why?

118
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,976
I thought you always wanted to.
-I can't... Not now...

119
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:32,000
Everyone's gonna need me at home.

120
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,930
We've planned some proper fun this time... Hunting...

121
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:43,816
And the music show!
-Aye, shindy in the spinney! Bands in the woodlands!

122
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,953
Okay.
-Bye.

123
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,373
He led the fight. Like a true hero...
-I feel sad for Mukesh though...

124
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:07,495
Don't be. I'm sure he's as proud as the rest of us.

125
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,409
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

126
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:26,619
It hasn't even been a month and you're here playing your guitar?

127
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,000
He was my husband. Your Dad!

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,630
But all you seem to care about is your blimmin' guitar!

129
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,497
D'you feel anything for your Dad at all? Like ever?

130
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,355
Vishal!

131
00:12:07,355 --> 00:12:10,342
Open the door!

132
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,557
Vishal?

133
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,759
What happened?

134
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,666
Vishal!

135
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,659
Vishal?

136
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,730
It's time for your pills...

137
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,554
Just a second...

138
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,106
Has Dad turned in?

139
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,724
Yeah... But he's too restless...

140
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,259
He's broken...

141
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,987
Ever since your Dad...

142
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:16,799
He's also restless because he won't have a home...

143
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:26,110
He'll be better once your Aunt's here... Just a few more days...

144
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,940
The unit asked for some papers... No idea where I've kept them...

145
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,104
Anyway, go get some rest...

146
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,732
Six months already?

147
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,910
First time I'm seeing my little Sarah...

148
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,100
There, now... You're crying?

149
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,159
No... Just... Delighted...

150
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,889
Seeing my little girl after months at the border... Just...

151
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,260
Makes me realise how beautiful this world can be...

152
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,550
A soldier's life ain't easy...

153
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,790
Time never heals some wounds...

154
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,373
Hello

155
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,260
Probably for someone else...

156
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,512
Why'd he want to talk to me?

157
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
T --

158
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,327
There?

159
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,570
Why in Heaven's name?

160
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,958
What's he thinking?

161
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,422
How are you???

162
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:50,890
n

163
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,098
no

164
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:54,280
not

165
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,508
not w

166
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:54,714
not we

167
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:54,975
not wel

168
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:57,086
not well

169
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,600
Same

170
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,461
Same here

171
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,919
The day everything changed forever...

172
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:35,620
Wonder what happened to him... But...

173
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,266
Why should I ask <i>him</i>?

174
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,046
She didn't even ask me...

175
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,928
Why would she?

176
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,670
But...

177
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,125
What was I thinking? Saying any of this...

178
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:31,269
What'd she care?

179
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,210
What was I thinking? Replying to him...

180
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,670
I hate the sound of his name!

181
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,051
But he messaged me...

182
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,692
I wonder why...

183
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,225
Mum... You up?

184
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,553
Hmm?

185
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,117
What is it?

186
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,550
Parents' evening... At Pari and Laxmi's school...

187
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,948
Aren't you going?

188
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,167
Why don't you?

189
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,939
Are you alright?

190
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,548
Yeah...

191
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,110
As much as I can be...

192
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't skive off school again, okay?

193
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,413
Ready?

194
00:22:48,413 --> 00:22:50,453
Yeah.

195
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,421
C'mon.

196
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,790
Is Mum ready?

197
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,090
No. I'm going with you.

198
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,993
As if you're Dad!

199
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,868
Get ready...

200
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,951
We're getting late...

201
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,290
Again? Remember what I told you?

202
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,150
What's wrong with you, Nadir? I've told you a hundred times!

203
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,200
I don't wanna do this... You're always yelling!

204
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,637
Well give me reason not to! Your notebook's a mess!

205
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:43,120
I don't need your help. You can just yell. I'll go ask Dad...

206
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,981
Dad!

207
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,950
What?

208
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,778
Back to work!

209
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,381
Lemme have a look...

210
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,730
Where's your mother?

211
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,820
She's not well... But she'll be here next time...

212
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,298
Oh, sorry...

213
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:23,499
I can understand how you feel... Please give her my condolences...

214
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:31,832
Pari, Laxmi... It's time you two got back up to full speed. Exams start next week. You've been absent for two weeks...

215
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:34,579
Please make sure they're regular.

216
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,614
Of course.

217
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,410
Who helps them with their schoolwork?

218
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,349
Mum... But I've taken over for now...

219
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:49,060
Okay. Don't worry. Here's my number. You can contact me anytime.

220
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,940
I'll be glad to help in any way I can.

221
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,551
Thank you.

222
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,998
Alright then, you may leave for your classes.

223
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,460
I don't wanna go to class, Vishal...

224
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,130
I want to go home...

225
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,508
Yeah, take us back...

226
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:16,368
You got to go to class.

227
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,144
Don't worry, I'll take them...

228
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,230
Thank you.

229
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,309
Your bag...

230
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,797
She beat me bad!

231
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:36,548
He's lying!

232
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,368
I just scolded you!

233
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:44,114
For the mess he's made of his notebook! See for yourself! No wonder why he's failing!

234
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:46,149
Easy there...

235
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,344
You didn't really need to!

236
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:52,324
D'you want me to help him or not?
-Not like <i>this</i>!

237
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:59,828
Don't worry. Mum's gonna help you.
-Fair enough. Up to you to fix him your way.

238
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,432
Calm down...

239
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:05,029
It's okay...

240
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,120
I remember this one...
-And this one...

241
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:15,124
From the birthday party...

242
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:17,585
That's you...

243
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:22,590
Remember how much he'd to bother you?

244
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:29,950
Aye... But he was the only one who cared... Helped me with everything... Took me over to friends'...

245
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,115
Remember how he'd pull my ponytails?

246
00:26:33,115 --> 00:26:35,508
Like, all the time!

247
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:39,042
He said he hated how they look...

248
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,605
Alright...

249
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,957
I can't go on...

250
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:59,846
I'll go check on Dad... No idea what happened to him. How can we go on?

251
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,846
The doctors said he's fine...

252
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,138
Excuse me...

253
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,924
That's how he is when he gets worried...

254
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,600
That's how he felt...

255
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,085
When Sherali left for the Siachen frontier...

256
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:24,804
Three years ago...

257
00:27:25,116 --> 00:27:30,254
You got to be brave... Strong...

258
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,870
But...

259
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:37,183
How... Just how?

260
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:40,982
What with endless worries...

261
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:50,685
Badar wants Amna to move to Karachi with the kids...

262
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:54,904
And -- What about the two of you?

263
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,604
That's what I'm worried about...

264
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:04,565
We can't live with her brother...

265
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,480
Nasir says...

266
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,710
One of us should live with you...

267
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,877
And the other with Ayesha...

268
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:06,686
There's a few things we need to sort out for it... Besides, we'd need to talk to his wife... At the office...

269
00:29:06,686 --> 00:29:11,217
How long will it take? A couple of days?
-No.

270
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:14,440
There are so many pending claims...

271
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,630
But Dad's a martyr... A hero...

272
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,192
Indeed. The Colonel was one of our finest.

273
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:24,107
We'll try our best to get it done quickly.

274
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,803
Okay.

275
00:29:28,378 --> 00:29:31,629
They want us to file a claim, right?

276
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:33,379
Yes.

277
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,890
And... All sorts of red tape... Forms, paperwork, and more...

278
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,287
Aye, red tape. That's it.

279
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,422
That's how it was back in your Grandpa's time...

280
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,938
But he'd retired from duty...

281
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,358
Who's gonna do it all? Mum...

282
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,019
Take Sunanda to a doctor.

283
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,038
Who?

284
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,551
You think I'm yampy?

285
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,540
What 'appened?

286
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,640
What'd you tell Vishal? What did you tell him? I need therapy?

287
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,476
No, Sunanda, I dedn't -- I joehst said...

288
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,940
Don't even start...

289
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,965
I heard everything!

290
00:30:43,965 --> 00:30:47,040
Well dat's because I care fahr you!
-Oh you do?

291
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,986
Aye.
-When'd that happen?

292
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:57,160
You've always tried to drive a wedge between me and Vijay!

293
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,072
Where'd it get you?

294
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,465
Where'd it get us?

295
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,509
Everything's gone...

296
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,110
Finished...

297
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,100
But now...

298
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,187
You're targeting Vishal!

299
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,798
Why'd I even think?

300
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,499
He's your son. My grandson...

301
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:27,007
No!

302
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,648
You want to drive a wedge between us!

303
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:33,413
Because that's what you've always done!

304
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,392
You've taken away everything I ever held dear!

305
00:31:36,392 --> 00:31:41,380
But not again! Get it? Mum!
-What happened, Mum? Everything alright?

306
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,390
Alright?

307
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:49,150
Of course not! Not when she's -- What's wrong with you?
-It's okay, Mum... Come...

308
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,662
Vishal... I won't let her snatch you!
-You need rest, Mum... Come...

309
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:59,932
Between your Mum and Granny, tell me you're always gonna pick your Mum! TELL ME!
-C'mon... Get some rest...

310
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:09,055
Why d'you want to pick a fight with Granny? Is it that hard to bury the hatchet?

311
00:32:10,218 --> 00:32:17,531
Why not? She's telling you I need therapy! You think I'm yampy?
-That's not what she -- No...

312
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:20,010
You're just... Depressed...

313
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,403
You <i>are</i> depressed.

314
00:32:23,403 --> 00:32:25,719
'Depressed'...

315
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:30,648
For the last 20 years, yes...

316
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:35,494
Ever since I fell for your Dad... And got married...

317
00:32:37,507 --> 00:32:41,500
D'you have any idea what your Granny's done all these years?

318
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,560
What, you want to settle the scores? Now? When she's just as helpless?

319
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,502
She's never helpless!

320
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:51,903
She's been a pain in my neck for half my life!

321
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:57,439
She didn't let me move in with Vijay for five years after our marriage!

322
00:32:57,439 --> 00:33:04,184
Five long years, we'd see each other in secret...

323
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:05,928
Because...

324
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:10,285
Your Granny didn't like it! Because she didn't know about it...

325
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:14,326
She ruined the first five years of our marriage...

326
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,160
And...

327
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,385
After we moved in... Whenever she paid a visit...

328
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:27,450
She'd treat me like a lowly animal!

329
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,470
And Vijay would just tell me to stay quiet...

330
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,819
'She's my Mum... My Dad's Queen'...

331
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:40,797
'Can't argue with her'. You get it.

332
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:45,832
And now she's turning you against me!
-What are you talking about?

333
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,168
No one can turn me against you.

334
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:55,153
You're my Mum... I'm your son...

335
00:33:55,153 --> 00:34:04,714
That's what I'm telling you! I'm your Mum, so as my son, you shouldn't listen to anyone else!

336
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,457
Vijay couldn't choose between the two women in his life...

337
00:34:11,457 --> 00:34:13,384
But you...

338
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,730
You've just got me, get it?

339
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,263
I get it, Mum -- I get it... But could you please step out of this room for a change?

340
00:34:22,263 --> 00:34:25,216
How long d'you want to stay locked in here?

341
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:29,827
Laxmi and Pari need you...

342
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,624
They all need me...

343
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,708
But the one I need...

344
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:45,376
Is no longer with us...

345
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,362
Granny... Do you, like... Know what Mum's going through?

346
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,107
You do, don't you? Yet...

347
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,886
Yet what?

348
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:47,473
Does it hurt her any more?
-No.

349
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,835
I only had him...

350
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,291
My only son...

351
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:00,833
I'm his mother...

352
00:36:01,149 --> 00:36:06,118
Wasn't he someone to his mother? Or is it just his wife who...

353
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:09,802
Of course not... We know how you feel...

354
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,440
But what can I do?

355
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,959
I say something to her and she tells me off. I say something to you and you tell me off.

356
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,720
I wish I could die right now...

357
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,254
At least I'd fend sahme peace...

358
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,918
Is it so easy?

359
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:42,594
You know how one death wracked our hearts with grief...

360
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:48,237
What'd anyone care if I live or die?

361
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:56,500
I lost my only son...

362
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,660
And all my daughter cares about is my estate...

363
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,037
While my daughter-in-law would rather not see me again!

364
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,054
Give me good reasahn to live.

365
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,690
Aye?

366
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,160
You gotta live, Granny...

367
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,384
For me...

368
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,310
You're all I have left, my boy...

369
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:38,918
My only hope...

370
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,666
Never leave me, Vishal...

371
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,303
Never...

372
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,593
Granny...

373
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,870
How'd you even think?

374
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,168
I'll be right here... For you.

375
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:11,810
Never leave me alone, okay, dear?

376
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,180
Vishal...

377
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:28,450
We're gonna need your help... Yeah, the usual red tape... Go there, do that, go there, do that...

378
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,270
I'll need a week to sort a few things out...

379
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,935
Why don't you sort things out over there? About coming over and all...

380
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:43,800
I'm coming there just once... To sort out Sherali's compensation and take you along...

381
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,492
I'm gonna need time...

382
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,830
We're in mourning... And I gotta think of something for Mum and Dad...

383
00:38:52,830 --> 00:39:00,403
Why don't you talk to your sisters-in-law? Let them decide who stays with who. Their visas are all sorted out.

384
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:03,360
Okay. We'll talk about it when you're here...

385
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,337
Okay. I'll get back to you. Got a few things to do.

386
00:39:08,337 --> 00:39:09,540
Bye.

387
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,054
Bye.

388
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:18,791
Mum told me your brother wants you to move to Karachi with him?

389
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,330
Yeah...

390
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:26,936
Because of the kids... And because I haven't got a job...

391
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,390
He's the only one who can help us...

392
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:37,259
That's why he wanted us to move to Karachi. He says we can live upstairs.

393
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:43,230
Don't even think about it. Don't leave for anywhere... It just won't be home...

394
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,160
Besides, the Army's gonna give you housing and all... You don't need to live with your brother.

395
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,927
Yeah.

396
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:53,125
But...

397
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,718
We've lost the man of the house...

398
00:39:56,937 --> 00:40:00,707
Nadir's a kid... And you've seen Dad...

399
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:07,829
Don't forget Sherali's Unit. They'll be there if you need anything. Don't worry.

400
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,010
You don't live here... You don't know...

401
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,518
This isn't the United States.

402
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:20,793
It ain't easy for a young woman to live all alone... Plus, Sarah's coming of age... And when Noria...

403
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,980
And... What about Mum and Dad? What d'you think?

404
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,920
Badar says they can live with you... Or Ayesha...

405
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,123
They can't live at our place... Not before my kids start college... That should free a room...

406
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:42,419
As for Ayesha... You know just how well she gets along with her in-laws!

407
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:48,442
But what's it to you? You're not thinking about them... You're just thinking of yourself.

408
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,178
No...

409
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:59,800
I've always cared for them... Sherali's parents have been like my own...

410
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,844
We wouldn't be talking about this if that were true.

411
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:09,114
Okay... I'll talk to Badar.

412
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:12,910
Maybe they can move to his place with us?

413
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,280
Don't leave your place, Amna...

414
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,630
You don't need to live with your brother!

415
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,682
Because... I've sorted things out for Sarah...

416
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,680
How?
-I mean...

417
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:34,780
Zuber's started college. Once he graduates and gets a job, we can get him and Sarah married.

418
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:43,612
That's one of your responsibilities taken care of. So please... Live here with Mum and Dad... Don't leave this place.

419
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,420
Sarah's too young... I haven't even thought about it...

420
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,520
Just give me your word... That's all I need...

421
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,790
All we need to sort this out.

422
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,880
I've talked to my husband and Zuber already. They're fine with it.

423
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,710
We can talk to Badar when he's here.

424
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
