Episode 10 - 'Blurred Borders'

21
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:28,350
When'd you get back?

22
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,423
Two weeks ago?

23
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,143
And how's the family?

24
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:35,768
Out of my life... I got divorced...

25
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:39,230
Really? But Shilpa was so nice!

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,740
Aye, the women are always nice... We're the nasty ones...

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,474
Stop it, Raj... You haven't changed one bit from your college days, have you?

28
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,494
Do you remember those days?

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,330
Can't forget them...

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,270
I've made it through all these years thanks to the memories...

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,920
You know about Vijay...

32
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,050
He's always been deployed in conflict zones...

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:15,626
And I used to tease you for it... Vijay's been cruel to me... Claimed you for himself...

34
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,261
But honestly...

35
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:22,601
I really feel sad for you... You made a great couple...

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,297
Aye...

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,620
He was my world...

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,715
I miss him every living moment...

39
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,530
I can understand...

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,223
How's Vishal?
-Great. He's doing his A-Levels...

41
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:41,460
Last year of school... About time he started planning things...

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,294
Really? I thought he'd be sitting his GCSEs this year...

43
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:48,919
And your daughters?
-They're just eight...

44
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,830
And your son -- What's his name?
-Vipin.

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,570
Aye, right... How's he?

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:03:00,390
He's with Shilpa... I talk to him now and then... Not her though...

47
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,592
Bitter divorce...

48
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,618
Bitter divorce?

49
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,890
She had an affair, and it wasn't easy for me, but I asked for it myself...

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,548
She's remarried now...

51
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,453
Hmm...

52
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:21,109
Aye... I'm sure it hurts...

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,339
She hit me where it hurts...

54
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:30,800
Vipin left for University... And I got transferred back to India...

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,500
I can't stay anywhere long.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,610
Just trying to reconnect with old friends since I got here...

57
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,981
Just trying to cope with my depression, you could say...

58
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:48,280
It was a heartbreak... But not as big as when Vijay made you his.

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,675
Please, Raj...

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,592
Sunanda...

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,774
What if I proposed to you again?

62
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,481
You're the only one who can help...

63
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:25,229
I wouldn't have had to ask you if Sherali were here...

64
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,396
You know how much he loved me...

65
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:34,910
I need some time to think... But don't worry... I'll do something...

66
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,052
You're the only one I've got now, Amna...

67
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:46,172
Anyway... I'll get back to you, okay?

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,597
Okay.

69
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:51,326
Give my regards to Mum and Dad... Tell the kids I said hi.

70
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,723
Okay.

71
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,020
Okay, bye.

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,811
Bye.

73
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,820
Who was it?

74
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,448
Aunt Ayesha...

75
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:07,381
What is it this time?

76
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:13,500
Zafar's suffered a big loss...

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,691
She was asking if we could lend her... 6 or 7 million-ish...

78
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,757
6 or 7 <i>million</i>-ish?

79
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,540
But how? And why is she asking you?

80
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,453
She's found out about the compensation for your Dad's death...

81
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:36,189
I hope you turned her down.

82
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:39,530
I said... I need some time...

83
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,948
You -- Need time?

84
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:46,857
Remember everything she said when she left! But now, she has the guts to ask for our 'help'!

85
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:53,508
I've lost count how many times Dad's lent Uncle something... Has he ever returned a penny?

86
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,655
I know... But I can't just turn her down like that...

87
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,424
You know how much your Dad loved her.
-He did...

88
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:06,452
But did she love us?

89
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,496
If she did, she'd know we've got no source of income...

90
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:15,858
She'd know we can't give away everything we've got left like that.

91
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,483
I know, but I can't say it to her face...

92
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,223
I said I'll talk to your Grandpa.

93
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,199
He'd be happy to help his dearest daughters...

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,861
Who doesn't love his daughters?

95
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:20,920
Neha is Anurag's niece. She wanted to visit India, so I thought I'd bring her along. Yeah?

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,748
Yeah.

97
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,893
Let's turn up the music, shall we? Unless... You don't like it?

98
00:07:37,893 --> 00:07:39,722
Sure...

99
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,151
♪ <i>That beauty is none but my sweetheart!</i> ♪

100
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,786
Blimey, that's some horrible traffic!

101
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:01,257
Aye, it ain't nothing like Canada!

102
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,947
Whoa! Are you okay? You sure you don't want that seat belt?

103
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,841
Aye, sorry, I just forgot...

104
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:29,264
Get used to forgetting in this part of the world...
-Okay...

105
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,471
Zafar called me too...

106
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,320
Not sure if he told Ayesha, but...

107
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,850
He told me if he didn't get the money...

108
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,929
He'd lose his property...

109
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:03,870
I tried to explain it to him...

110
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:10,270
But he thinks I've struck gold or something.

111
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:15,687
So... What do we do?

112
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,800
We've got the compensation...

113
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,229
But we've got duties...

114
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,558
He's been asking for a few months... I'm sure he'll pay us back...

115
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:34,207
What if he didn't?

116
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,337
We can't ask for it...

117
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,567
They've borrowed from Sherali before...

118
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,720
Yeah, from their brother...

119
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,980
But they've got to return it to his wife.

120
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,483
They know what's going on in your life...

121
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,305
Okay... As you say...

122
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:13,840
I'd never have said it if it were not my own daughter...

123
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,061
You know her in-laws very well...

124
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,756
And, thanks to your daughter and son-in-law... I can't even look my daughter-in-law in the eye.

125
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,976
Parbhu...

126
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,937
How long are you staying here?

127
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:32,862
Can't believe you're asking that the day I'm here.

128
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,835
Naw...

129
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,950
Just... Thinking...

130
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,146
I mean...

131
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:49,395
I'm sure you've -- Got other things to take care of, yes?

132
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:51,806
Get it?

133
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:01,337
Granny... I'm here because I wanted to see every place in India I can, and Aunt told me Vishal's gonna show me!

134
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,323
Vishal?

135
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,968
Aye. Once he's done with his exams, why not?

136
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,450
I've made a list.

137
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:21,140
Shopping, tourist attractions, and then there's this concert...

138
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,880
So many things to do!

139
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,731
Neha's a lovely girl... Very friendly and fun-loving. She's just started college, by the way.

140
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,111
Wow. What are you studying?

141
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:36,936
Art and theatre, but I've got a thing for music too.

142
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:41,503
Vishal's got a thing for music too. He's quite the singer himself!
-Aye.

143
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:45,964
So you told me... You've told me a lot about him...

144
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,113
Gotta say, this is delicious!
-Have some more!

145
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,751
Mum?

146
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,063
Hmm?

147
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:11,240
You've got to... Talk to Sarah's Mum, remember?

148
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,577
Not now, Vishal... Not in front of Pratibha!

149
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:18,590
Everyone's gonna find out... Say things about you and me...

150
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,984
But you've got to say sorry to them.

151
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,936
I will!
-Just do it!

152
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:30,325
Actually -- It's a bit embarrassing for me too...
-Don't you care too much for --

153
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:35,537
I just needed a drink.
-It's in the fridge...

154
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,066
Nah, not this one...

155
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,923
But...

156
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:49,053
I guess this will do!

157
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,004
You've mixed your coursebooks with Dad's books...

158
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:09,710
We shouldn't be lending anything to Aunt. You're making a big mistake.

159
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:13,480
Back to work, Sarah... Don't get on my wick...

160
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,734
I'm not a kid anymore... I can tell you what I think...

161
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,983
Vishal says you're making a mistake too.

162
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:25,530
Why d'you need to tell him about everything?

163
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,105
Do you need to tell him about everything in our lives?

164
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:34,626
It's our problem, aye... But you're making a big mistake...

165
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,848
Mark my words, they're not gonna return a penny!

166
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,340
I can't turn your Granny and Grandpa down like that.
-They're just thinking of their daughters.

167
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:51,390
Why do they want our money? D'you think they'd give us a penny if we needed anything?

168
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,790
Sarah's right...

169
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,504
We don't need to give Ayesha and Zafar a penny...

170
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,690
It's all for Sherali's family...

171
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,406
His kids...

172
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,235
Mum...

173
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,498
Mum! Wait!

174
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:37,178
Shut up the kids, and stop listening to a mature voice of reason! What's next?

175
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,255
Where were you all day?

176
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,879
Too busy...

177
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,910
Honestly knackered...

178
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,814
What happened? Your Aunt back?

179
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:58,277
Aye... How d'you know?

180
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,630
I just do...

181
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,695
There's your Aunt...

182
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,933
And then there's mine...

183
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:12,730
Always something going on... Wonder why we don't empower our women so they don't get blackmailed by their in-laws into blackmailing their families.

184
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:15,560
Girls are natural blackmailers...

185
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:23,012
Could you not typecast or be so chauvinistic for a change? Like, haven't you got your Granny, your Mum or your sisters?

186
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:31,060
Thank you for including Granny there... 'Mum and sisters' sounds so stereotypical... Like they all say?

187
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,250
I'm anything but stereotypical... Not me, not my life...

188
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
What's up with your Aunt?

189
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,845
Oh, nothing... The same old...

190
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:48,871
She's blackmailing Mum... Grandpa and Granny haven't had anything all day... And I'm the black sheep here! No one wants to talk to me!

191
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,718
Look...

192
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:57,058
Whatever happens, don't give them a penny. Make it clear to your Mum, okay?

193
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,087
I don't know...

194
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:05,400
But I think Mum's gonna give up... She won't take up arms against them...

195
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,050
Ain't she a soldier's wife?
-She is...

196
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,244
Wives ain't nearly as used to fighting... Even soldiers' wives...

197
00:17:13,244 --> 00:17:16,000
They're only taught to compromise...

198
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,281
What about you?

199
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,299
Never.

200
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,900
I want to be strong.

201
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,925
Not helpless, cowardly, and dependent.

202
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,173
You're outta luck, mate... In Pakistan, at least.

203
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:36,890
As if it's any different in India. Don't act like you folks don't want doormats for wives.

204
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,167
Hardly different.

205
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,497
There, now... Don't embarrass me like that...

206
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,270
Your Mum didn't call Mum...

207
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,813
She will... She's got her number... Tell her to take her call, okay?

208
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,863
She's talked to a colleague... May be able to help find someone in Pakistan...

209
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,328
Anyway...

210
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,814
I'm positively knackered... Need some rest.

211
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,687
Okay... Good night...

212
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:24,106
Can't believe you said good night in a second.

213
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,822
You amaze me...

214
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:27,956
How?

215
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:32,766
You said you needed some rest. So I said good night. What's wrong?

216
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:35,076
Nothing, really...

217
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,420
Good night.

218
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,736
Good night.

219
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,090
Hello?

220
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,464
Hung up...

221
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,564
Mum!

222
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,944
Where's everyone?

223
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,470
Grandpa? Granny? Mum?

224
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:49,984
Sarah!

225
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,840
What happened?
-Mum!

226
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,640
What happened?

227
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,249
Elena called! Just got my result!

228
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:02,010
Yeah?
-Straight A*s!

229
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,426
Best in the school!
-Congratulations!

230
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:09,856
Did you tell Granny and Grandpa?
-Nope. Wanted to tell you first.

231
00:20:09,856 --> 00:20:13,030
Well done, Sarah.

232
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:18,060
Guess what! Straight A*s in her A-Levels!

233
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,290
Congratulations! When'd you get your result?

234
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,641
Just now!

235
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,811
Sherali always wanted you to be a doctor...

236
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,770
I know...

237
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,439
I'm working on making his dream a reality.

238
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,091
Tell your Granny yet?

239
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,333
Sofia!
-Mum!

240
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,498
Sofia!

241
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,960
Mum... I need to get some dresses stitched... Who's your tailor?

242
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,961
The same old...

243
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:05,083
Why don't you go with Vishal tomorrow?

244
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,375
Vishal's taking Neha shopping...

245
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,476
Besides, I ain't going to a mall or something...

246
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,156
Excuse me...

247
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,690
Congrats, Doc!

248
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,960
Slow down, it's my A-Level result.

249
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,020
Doc's gonna need a few years...

250
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,609
This is the first step.

251
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:40,028
Thank God...

252
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,623
It was Dad's one dream...

253
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:48,054
He used to call me 'Doc' like you too...

254
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,936
So, you off to a hostel or something?
-No.

255
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,712
I'll apply to a medical college in my city...

256
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:59,408
Had to change my plans...

257
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:03,115
Can't leave my family all alone here...

258
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,421
Yeah, I understand...

259
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:07,129
Congrats anyway.

260
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,371
When are you sending me sweets?

261
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,183
Buy what you like and enjoy yourself.

262
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:20,310
We don't exchange sweets here... Except our soldiers on the border...

263
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,013
And our Prime Ministers when they meet...

264
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:27,200
How about you change things? Send some sweets here and... Start a trend, maybe?

265
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,379
Sending 'em's gonna cost more than the sweets themselves. So, have what you like... And send me, perhaps?

266
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,267
What about my money?

267
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:40,532
When d'you care about money? You ain't a Scrooge like me, are you?

268
00:22:40,532 --> 00:22:42,521
Aye...

269
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,512
Anyway, mate...

270
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,156
I gotta go back...

271
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,370
Have dinner...

272
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,820
Bye...

273
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,091
Hello?

274
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:07,939
It's Vishal's mother. Sunanda.

275
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,950
Are you Sarah's mother?

276
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:15,682
Yeah.

277
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:19,449
It's me.

278
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:22,240
How are you?

279
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:25,178
Good...

280
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,641
And you?

281
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,779
Good.

282
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:35,951
So... You wanted to talk to me?
-So... You wanted to talk to me?

283
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,767
I don't know what to say...

284
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:47,076
Vishal's Granny... The other day...

285
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:51,160
Everything she said...

286
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,649
I'm sorry about everything...

287
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,657
I'm really sorry...

288
00:23:55,657 --> 00:24:02,892
I'm sorry too... If anything my in-laws said... Hurt you...

289
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:06,447
That's how their generation thinks...

290
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,233
Yeah...

291
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,959
So...

292
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:13,323
What d'you want me to call you?

293
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:14,458
Amna?

294
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,984
Uh...

295
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,396
Yeah, that's good...

296
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,310
Or Mrs Sherali...

297
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:30,457
Our wounds would bleed every time we called each other...

298
00:24:30,457 --> 00:24:34,497
Mrs Sherli and Mrs Vijay Malhotra...

299
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,499
But Amna and Sunanda...

300
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:45,528
May be able to pour their hearts out to each other...

301
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:49,622
That's right...

302
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,091
Suninda...

303
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,220
Sunanda...

304
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,682
Sunenda...

305
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:03,749
Don't worry too much about Nadir, okay?

306
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,290
If he's got a learning disability, he can overcome it...

307
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,044
I've worked with SEND kids before...

308
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,728
He's my only son...

309
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,739
I want him...

310
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:21,773
To be like his father...

311
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:23,621
But...

312
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:29,941
I've got to tell the world about our problems...

313
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,963
I understand...

314
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,670
But I'm sure you can find help in Pakistan...

315
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,962
Someone who can show you the way...

316
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,720
And... You've always got me...

317
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,118
Feel free to talk to me about anything you need...

318
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,895
You've got a job...

319
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:53,990
I'm a housewife...

320
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,726
There's a lot that's easy for you...

321
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:01,615
That I can't even imagine...

322
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:08,491
It's not like I run the world... I'm a third world woman... Just like you...

323
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:13,667
There's a lot I can only imagine... But never do...

324
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:18,427
By the way, Vishal said Sarah got into medical college?

325
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,804
I forgot to congratulate you...

326
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,869
Thank you.

327
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:29,373
We're grieving again today...

328
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,310
It would've been such a happy day...

329
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,782
If her Dad were with us...

330
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,382
I can understand...

331
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:43,287
It's the same here...

332
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,704
Good news brings us to tears...

333
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,657
But, as they say, life's gotta go on...

334
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,082
Ups and downs...

335
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,981
Was he your love?

336
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,083
My parents' choice...

337
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,902
What about you?

338
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,874
He was...

339
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,848
Vijay took up arms against the whole world to marry me...

340
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:27,163
We came from different classes, different ends of the country... But his love was blind to it all...

341
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,733
He was poet too...

342
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:37,648
He lost his heart to me when we met at a competition...

343
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:41,434
I lost my heart to him... When I heard his poetry...

344
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,313
No idea why I'm telling you any of it...

345
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,491
It's okay... I don't mind it...

346
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,890
He was my parents' choice...

347
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,261
So to speak...

348
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,890
But now that he's gone...

349
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,511
It feels like I've lost the love of my life...

350
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,760
God, he's spoilt me so much...

351
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,217
I've been handicapped...

352
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:23,111
Ever since he's gone...

353
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,986
We've got everything, so to speak...

354
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:34,417
An estate, kids, my in-laws...

355
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,410
But there's this emptiness...

356
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,398
That's swallowed them all...

357
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,932
I haven't had a good night's sleep ever since...

358
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,362
This bed... In my room... It's never seen him... Felt him...

359
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:57,617
I can't talk to anyone...

360
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,721
No one will understand...

361
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:07,614
Vijay never liked me in white...

362
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,252
But...

363
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:17,240
Now... All I've got is white... It's all I can wear...

364
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:25,959
When I walk past his picture in white, I feel like he's giving me that look...

365
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,671
Feeling sad for me...

366
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:35,062
There are things a wife only shares with her husband...

367
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:39,330
Know what...

368
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,847
I just loved to snuggle with him...

369
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,107
Being close to him...

370
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:50,275
I felt safe from the world...

371
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,812
When Noria and Nadir snuggle with me...

372
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:04,625
I haven't got the strength to be their Sherali...

373
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:10,211
I get chills in my feet in the winter...

374
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:17,749
Vijay would warm them with his feet when he'd be here...

375
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:23,788
His hands, his feet... They were always so warm...

376
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,416
They were my fireplace...

377
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:29,980
But now...

378
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,550
My fire's been extinguished...

379
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,474
They say he died a hero's death...

380
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,783
But I ask why he left me...

381
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,616
Yeah...

382
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,488
That's what they tell me too...

383
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:52,394
'You should be proud'...

384
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,505
'You should be proud'...

00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,089
From where?

401
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:47,094
India.

402
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:51,956
Have it... It's for your result.

403
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,280
Can't believe it's gotten to a point where they're exchanging sweets!

404
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,100
She can never be yours! I hope you're clear about that!

405
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,010
She can never be yours! I hope you're clear about that!
-Of course...

406
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:08,000
Of course... It's not like I love her or something... It's just -- Plain impossible!
