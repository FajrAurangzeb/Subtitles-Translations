1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,310
From enmity to empathy, it led me astray...

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,357
Through mud and dirt, humanity found its way...

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,820
I know what you're thinking... How can people from different communities... Different nations...

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,770
Grieve the same?

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,951
But when the dust settles and humanity shines...

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,940
Who are you to me?

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,676
Someone who shares your pain. As his own.

8
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,639
I'm

9
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm Vishal.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,481
A fallen hero's son.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,638
Someone who sees the enemy as human.

12
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,920
We've got a lot in common... Besides our grief, I mean...

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,440
Well then, doesn't that make it easier to be friends?

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,917
Does it?

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,480
Right...

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,450
Or wrong...

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll leave you to decide that.
