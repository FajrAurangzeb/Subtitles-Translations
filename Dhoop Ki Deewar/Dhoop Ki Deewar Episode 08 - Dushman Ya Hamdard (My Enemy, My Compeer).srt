Episode 8 - 'My Enemy, My Compeer'

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,660
Something wrong?

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,348
Why?

23
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:43,011
Granny and Grandpa didn't say anything when I greeted them.

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,884
Something you said? Or Uncle?

25
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:50,210
Your Grandpa heard you talking to Vishal last night.

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,318
He asked me, and I told him about him.

27
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,896
Who wouldn't be furious? Don't say I didn't warn you.

28
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,081
I'll sort it out.
-How?

29
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:10,699
What're you gonna say? 'You can't stop me from talking to the boy whose father --'
-Please, Mum... He's something else too... Something much more...

30
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,522
He's lost his father too...

31
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,980
Aye, that's why they don't want to talk to us either.

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,193
But you're outta your minds, you two.

33
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:28,241
Don't think you can sing a duet on social media and win hearts all over... We've shed each other's blood.

34
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:29,871
I know...

35
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:34,181
We've <i>both</i> shed blood... Both lost... And hurt...

36
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,305
That's why we talk...

37
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:38,410
Hurt?

38
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,540
What d'you want to say?

39
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,633
You think your Dad's heroism is something that hurts us?

40
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,185
Doesn't it?

41
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,223
Don't you dare say that to your Grandpa and Granny.

42
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,395
I'm sure Vishal doesn't dare either.

43
00:02:57,395 --> 00:03:01,313
Remember the slap he earned for talking to you?

44
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:03,042
I do...

45
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,140
His Mum wants to talk to us. You and me.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,382
Us?

47
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,208
Why?

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,395
She wants to help.

49
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,352
Are you out to lunch?

50
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,900
Why'd she want to help us?

51
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,600
Who asked for her help?

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,381
Me...

53
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,969
What do <i>you</i> want from them?

54
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,704
Mum...

55
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:38,155
Nadir's teacher told me --

56
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,024
The other day...

57
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:42,930
That he's got a learning disability...

58
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,200
Probably dyslexia...

59
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:49,860
I couldn't figure it out, so I talked to Vishal...

60
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,020
He said his Mum's a psychiatrist who's worked with SEND kids...

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,252
What's the big deal if I talked to him about it?

62
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,714
You should've talked to me...

63
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:04,232
You should've told me what his teacher said.

64
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:13,900
But <i>you</i>'re looking for help in India... As if we haven't got anyone who can help here! And -- Of all the people... Did you have to ask <i>him</i>?
-Mum -- I was too troubled to think! I didn't want to trouble you!

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,607
I didn't even know if she was right about what she said...

66
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:27,069
Could you - <i>any of you</i> - not get up my nose for a change, like, ever?

67
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:30,336
My brother doesn't want to talk to me because of you...

68
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:36,750
I've never stepped out of the house, but I've got no end of things to do out there!

69
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,727
Who d'you think we've got who can help us? But you had to create another mess!

70
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:45,338
For Christ's sake... Just spare me! Please!

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,187
Yes, it's Mrs Brigadier Malhotra, Colonel Vijay Malhotra's mother...

72
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:07,664
Thank you...

73
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,646
I thought if you could help me...

74
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:22,267
I'd rented the place my husband got after his retirement out...

75
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,875
Yeah...

76
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,566
The tenant doesn't want to leave...

77
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:31,756
I'll give you all the details...

78
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:36,886
But he's very rude... Almost threatening...

79
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,931
I want him out this month. Because I want to sell it right away.

80
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,187
Okay. Thank you.

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,759
Mum...

82
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,232
Granny's talking to someone from the Unit...

83
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:19,077
I'm going to see them tomorrow...

84
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:22,002
I'm sure the Army can kick them out.

85
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,947
They can't do nothing...

86
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:30,388
Even the Army's powerless before the sort your Granny's rented that place to...

87
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:33,702
Your Dad tried to stop her, but when does she listen to reason?

88
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:42,410
It's all just... Brahmin sentiment to her... Thought it'd be nice if someone her class... From the party she's always rooting for... Could stay there... Yet here we are...

89
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,975
Mum...

90
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,675
They're nothing before the Army...

91
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:52,632
I'm a hero's son... I'm sure they'd show some respect...

92
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,903
'Respect'...

93
00:06:54,903 --> 00:07:02,220
There's millions like you in the billion people here... A bunch of them lose their lives every day... How many d'you think they'd respect?

94
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,017
Why're you so bitter?

95
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:10,341
I'm not bitter. Just realistic.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,337
Here...

97
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:14,952
They've made an order to show cause...

98
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:18,709
For my 'long and unexplained leave'.

99
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,133
They know everything...

100
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:26,320
Well, just tell them?

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,412
I'm trying to... I'm writing my reply...

102
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,193
I'm the late Colonel Vijay Malhotra's widow...

103
00:07:36,193 --> 00:07:43,786
I'm sorry I couldn't attend to my duties because of my husband's sudden and unexpected demise.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,450
The nation wants sacrifices...

105
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,793
Not excuses...

106
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,591
That's all it asks of its people...

107
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,488
So...

108
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,534
Say something, will ya?

109
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,165
What?

110
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:28,370
What is it?

111
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,032
How d'you know?

112
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,781
I can hear it in your voice.

113
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,110
I know you're troubled.

114
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,000
What is it this time?

115
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,233
Dad shouldn't have left us...

116
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,384
Not like this... Not so soon...

117
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:06,051
That's what I'm thinking too...

118
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:08,193
We needed him here...

119
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:12,850
Grandma's estate... The one Aunt wants a share in...

120
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,315
Has been taken over by the tenants.

121
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:16,183
What?

122
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:22,034
Aye. We gotta do something. And do it quick. Aunt's coming in two days. No way she's gonna take this nicely.

123
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:26,725
Why don't you talk to the Unit? They'll throw them out in a moment.

124
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:28,821
I did...

125
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,263
But nothing happens in a moment...

126
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:34,196
They told me I have to file an application...

127
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:37,005
Which I did... Let's see...

128
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,230
Anyway, did you talk to Mum... About that... Thing?

129
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,859
Grandpa's found out I talk to you.

130
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,055
That why you're worried?

131
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,432
No one wants to talk to me...

132
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,690
Suddenly, I'm the traitor...

133
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,688
Is that... You telling me you can't talk to me anymore?

134
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,930
I can't talk to anyone like I talk to you...

135
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,520
But when I talk to you...

136
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,478
It hurts everyone.

137
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,197
They think I'm talking to the son of the man who --

138
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:37,290
Well, so am I. Talking to the girl whose father killed mine...

139
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,657
Anyway, how long d'you want to keep at it? I need to know when I should come back on Facebook.

140
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,928
Sarah?

141
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,588
Yeah?

142
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,247
Can I... See you on Skype?

143
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,357
Nah, I get it... Fraidy-cat ain't gonna show me her face.

144
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:24,858
You'd be stupid to think I'm so stupid.

145
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,318
D'you think I'd do all you want...

146
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:32,975
When you want it?

147
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,171
In your dreams, perhaps, but never for real...

148
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:42,630
I'm a soldier's daughter, but I'm smart.

149
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,850
You're weird...

150
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,998
Really.

151
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,521
The different sort...

152
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,610
The memorable sort...

153
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,849
Hello?

154
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,873
You there?

155
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,102
Did I stick around too long?

156
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,655
Did you mind it? Me saying that...

157
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,737
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

158
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,716
(How do I say it...?)

159
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,219
Sarah...

160
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,812
You know, I --

161
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:37,547
I think you're very...

162
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,626
Uh...

163
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,809
A -- Actually...

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,260
What I want to say is --

165
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,399
Anyway, I'm honestly sleepy...

166
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,329
Gotta get some rest. Bye.

167
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,900
Okay, good night...

168
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,915
The stars and the heavens above...

169
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:20,390
See you in another part of the world...

174
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,589
I can't be too sure, but... I think he's dyslexic.

175
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:02,092
That's why I asked your daughter to consult a psychologist.

176
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,233
We've never even heard of it before.

177
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,980
What is his problem, exactly?

178
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:22,797
It's just a learning disability. Many kids have one. It can be managed if addressed on time...

179
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,260
But -- He never had any problems before...

180
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:36,989
I think Nadir's just disturbed and upset... After my husband's death...

181
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:43,043
I'm sure he's upset... But that's got nothing to do with this.

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,910
I'm sure he had this problem before... Perhaps no one could identify it...

183
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,203
I did when I started taking his classes a few months back.

184
00:14:54,203 --> 00:15:02,115
I couldn't talk to you about it before, but now that you're here, I think we should do something about it.

185
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:11,848
Would you happen to know any psychiatrist or psychologist? He can sort this out.

186
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:17,112
I don't know any myself, but I'll see what I can do.

187
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:21,663
I'll try to find someone who can treat him.

188
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,470
Could you give me your number?

189
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,104
Dad...

190
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:46,470
Nadir will be fine, won't he?
- Of course.

191
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,075
The teacher said he'll be fine.

192
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:55,075
It's just a... Whatsit... Learning disability.

193
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,697
We'll get him treated before it's too late.

194
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,042
He's my only son...

195
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,610
If he couldn't do well...

196
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,307
Amna...

197
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:09,604
Don't worry.

198
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,873
I'll do my best.

199
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:18,042
I'll look for someone. Do something for him. Sort this out.

200
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:28,766
Who d'you think did all of this when wee Sherali fell ill?

201
00:16:28,766 --> 00:16:32,455
I could manage something back then... I sure can now...

202
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,728
Never forget...

203
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:40,969
Age cannot wear my will.

204
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,305
Don't worry.

205
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,083
Our worries don't seem to end...

206
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,521
There's always something...

207
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,890
C'mon...

208
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,941
I'll call Badar... He may be able to help.

209
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,117
Sure.

210
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:29,577
He's in Karachi. I'm sure he'd know someone in the city...

211
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,200
I'll talk to Rabia and Ayesha...

212
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,412
The doctors in the UK and the States can treat anything...

213
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:49,524
Besides, I'm sure they'll do anything they can for their nephew...

214
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:52,210
They'd care for him...

215
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,957
Hello?

216
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,089
Hello...

217
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,046
Yeah?

218
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,926
How are you?

219
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:04,415
Fine.

220
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,534
Umm...

221
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:09,494
Something's come up --

222
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:12,571
Why am I not surprised?

223
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,982
Otherwise, why'd you think of me?

224
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:19,379
I'm sorry but I don't have the time...

225
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:23,781
But don't worry... I'm sure your in-laws can help...

226
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,774
Why d'you want to talk to Rabia? She left us in a fit of rage!

227
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:45,170
Who else have I got?

228
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,447
Amna's brother doesn't seem to care!

229
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:53,179
I'm sure it's the same with Rabia...

230
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,630
And...

231
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,822

I mean, I ain't that bad...

267
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,667
Or maybe, she's so mesmerised!

Nah, I ain't <i>that</i> good either...

Nah, forget it...

You're angry?

273
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:03,462
You know everything.

274
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,774
It's not like I talk to him in secret...

275
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,651
Mum knows about him.
-Never thought you'd be so shameless!

276
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:19,700
You say that like you've known him for ages! You know who they are, right?

277
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,667
Yeah...

278
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:26,070
But don't we talk to millions of others?

279
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,470
People of every country... Every religion... How are <i>they</i> any different?

280
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,284
Only because <i>they</i> don't think that way!

281
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,680
Have you ever seen how proudly they act?

282
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,821
How they talk about us?

283
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:49,994
Remember everything they said when you had a row with Vishal online?

284
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:53,292
Remember everything you used to tell me?

285
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,020
But most of all... Remember everything <i>he</i> said on TV?

286
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,518
It -- It was silly... Stupid of us...

287
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:06,171
Only those who fight pay the price... The rest of us just...

288
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:06,957
Cheer on,

289
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:07,704
Cheer on, make noise, and --

290
00:25:07,704 --> 00:25:09,307
Cheer on, make noise, and -- Enjoy the circus!

291
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,590
Cheer on, make noise, and -- Enjoy the circus!
-Sarah!

292
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,523
Sarah!

293
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,948
Why d'you have to talk to Vishal?

294
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:18,622
We've got enough on our hands already.

295
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,985
Okay...

296
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,338
I won't talk to him if you say...

297
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:32,520
But I just talk to him! Just talk...

298
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,691
You've never made friends with a boy before...

299
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,447
And --
-(Jesus...) It's not like I'm friends with him.

300
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:44,041
We talk because we're enemies. Sworn enemies at that.

301
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,379
Grandpa...

302
00:25:54,379 --> 00:26:01,100
Ever since he lost his Dad... They're going through the same mess as us... Living through the same hell...

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,340
But what hurts me...

304
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,097

305
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,242
It hurts me a lot...

306
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,046
Where'd she disappear?

307
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,999

308
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,073

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,197
You shouldn't have done that...

321
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,870
But don't worry...

322
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,761
I'm right here... At <i>your</i> place...

323
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,332
Throw me out if you can...

324
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,170
But don't forget...

325
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,094
The sacrifice of your son...

326
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,590
Save your grandson while there's time...

327
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,660
Your bloodline risks...

328
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,015
Extinction...

329
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,608
Long live India...

330
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000

331
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,780
I never knew you've got such a lovely voice.

332
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,063
You noticed it just now? We talk - like - everyday.

333
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:44,571
Never paid attention to it...

334
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:48,116
So... How was the shocker? My song?
-A pleasant shock...

335
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:55,080
Can't believe you care so much about them that you're worried about her Mum more than your studies!

336
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,219
Call them when it's okay. I'll talk to them.
-How about right now?
