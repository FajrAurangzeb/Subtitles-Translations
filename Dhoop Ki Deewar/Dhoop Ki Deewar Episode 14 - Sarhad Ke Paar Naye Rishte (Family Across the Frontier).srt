Episode 14 - 'Family Across the Frontier'

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,170
Where in Amritsar did your Dad live?

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,677
Wonder why you're suddenly thinking of Amritsar...

23
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:37,608
I talked to Vishal's Granny.

24
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:40,620
His Grandpa was from Amritsar...

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,140
Why'd you talk to her at all?

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,889
Just... Saying hello... Thanked her for the sweets...

27
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:53,090
She mentioned Amritsar somewhere in-between...

28
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,300
You two didn't have to start talking about Amritsar and Jhelum...

29
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,767
How d'you know I said anything about Jhelum?

30
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,944
I'm sure you've found something to rekindle old ties...

31
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:12,675
'Rekindle old ties'...

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,080
Her in-laws were from Jhelum...

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,600
All those TV dramas are damaging your brains!

34
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,170
Blimey, her fluent Punjabi though...

35
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,194
She told me a lot about Amritsar... A lot that reminded me of everything your Mum and Dad used to say...

36
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:37,150
Kathiya Wala Bazaar! That's where Mum and Dad lived, remember?

37
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,700
She mentioned it many times!

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,520
And Dogurji Chowk!

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,911
What's this Dogurji Chowk thing?

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,727
Dad never even mentioned it! Not once!

41
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,030
Anyway... I've heard of Kathiya Wala Bazaar myself...

42
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,880
Shoba's Dad ran a furniture shop there!

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,901
Your Dad worked with him, yes?

44
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,251
Aye!

45
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,000
He's the one who supplied the wood!

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,396
Sofia!

47
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:14,704
Leaving me in the middle of a conversation is --

48
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:15,574
Ab

49
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,311
Abso

50
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:17,220
Absolutely

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,050
Absolutely despicable!

52
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,380
She said she'll send a few pictures of Jhelum...

53
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,954
Including the place by the river where Vijay's grandparents lived...

54
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,969
She knows every place there...

55
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,860
Every place...

56
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,231
I've only heard about from his Grandpa...

57
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,092
Granny...

58
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,010
Can't believe you're so close now...

59
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,450
I mean, you were barely ready to talk!

60
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,367
♪ <i>I'm close to them?</i> ♪

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,883
Ah wait, Oi exchanged sweets, roi?

62
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:02,408
Vijay's Grandpa used to sit by the river...

63
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,859
Writing poems...

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,464
Vijay's Grandma told me...

65
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:12,660
When the land was divided...

66
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,880
And he had to leave the city...

67
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,211
He was crying all the way 'ere...

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,610
By the way...

69
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,593
Mr Nasir Ali's from Amritsar too...

70
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,720
His family...

71
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,129
Had to leave their home too...

72
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,170
Both Sherali's Grandpa...

73
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,020
And my Dad...

74
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,603
Used to work in the Bazaar...

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,305
Jesus Christ... They talked for an hour... At least!

76
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:58,780
I thought you said she doesn't say one more word than needed? But... Whoa...

77
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,492
I've never seen Granny talk to anyone else like she did to your Granny...

78
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:08,054
By the way, why'd your Granny have to mention the sweets?

79
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,770
What? She told her?
-Aye...

80
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,904
Your Granny must've been furious... I hope she didn't say anything...?

81
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:17,753
No... She did mention it though...

82
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:20,991
I'm sure she's gonna tell Grandpa too...

83
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,410
My Granny would've told Grandpa everything... If he were with us... Like she just told us at the dinner table...

84
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,858
That my Grandpa's Dad... Used to write... And sing...

85
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:35,190
By the banks of the Jhelum...

86
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,688
Guess I'm like him...

87
00:05:37,688 --> 00:05:41,001
I'm attending a wedding tomorrow.
-Really?

88
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,581
Where?

89
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,948
Our neighbours'. Their daughter's getting married. We've been invited.

90
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:53,420
Nice change for your family.

91
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,554
Mum ain't going... But Grandpa and Granny might...

92
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,066
When do your classes start?

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,108
In a few days...

94
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,989
Okay... By the way...

95
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,377
Don't forget...

96
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:10,126
To send me some pictures.

97
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:14,560
What'd you do with them?
-Nothing... Just -- Have a look?

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,908
Check out how weddings are over there.

99
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,860

Blimey, she's real lovely.

160
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:50,597
Have you talked to someone already?

161
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:53,020
Not yet...

162
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,488
She's too young... Still studying...

163
00:10:56,488 --> 00:11:00,303
I got Meliha engaged in her first year. Now that she's got a house job, we're getting her married.

164
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:09,230
I would've gotten her married earlier... If her man had not been out of the country for higher studies.
-Great. Yeah...

165
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,414
She can study all she wants after her marriage.

166
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,567
That's all ?

167
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:31,854
Isn't it enough already?

00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,730
isn't it enough already

00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:46,795

Lovely.

195
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,340
Cüneyt's father asked about you.

196
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,598
He wanted to come and get you... But I stopped him.

197
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,174
Aye...

198
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,631
He called me...

199
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,514
I'll be there at the party tomorrow...

200
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,057
Cüneyt's mother proposed Cüneyt's marriage to Sarah.

201
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,387
Sarah?

202
00:15:17,646 --> 00:15:20,320
She just got into college!

203
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,486
Aye. That's what I told her too.

204
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:30,394
She said she got her daughter engaged when she'd started college too...

205
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,882
She doesn't mind waiting.

206
00:15:32,882 --> 00:15:36,750
We're not marrying Sarah to a military man.

207
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,094
Who knows what may...

208
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:41,569
That's what I thought...

209
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,609
So, I didn't talk about anything else...

210
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,924
Cüneyt's really nice though.

211
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,670
I don't want my girl to live my kind of life...

212
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,312
I want her to study...

213
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:01,590
She won't be a liability...

214
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,038
If - God forbid - anything ever happened...

215
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,015
She won't be dependent...

216
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,765
You're right...

217
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:15,400
We got Ayesha and Rabia married off too early...

218
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,030
If we'd let them study...

219
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,145
They wouldn't have been suffering at the hands of their husbands and in-laws...

220
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,406
I don't really have words...

221
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:06,466
To describe how beautiful you are...

222
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,502
Aye, Vishal?

223
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,829
Got these at the traffic light...

224
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:05,876
You know I love their fragrance...

225
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,156
Oh, yes... Dad used to get you these... And put them on you himself...

226
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,023
That's all... Long gone...

227
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,783
I'll get you your flowers...

228
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,565
In a few years... For <i>your</i> wife... Sure...

229
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:43,240
Not sure if you're even gonna remember how much I like them then...

230
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,888
I never forget anything, Mum...

231
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:48,974
Anything you say or ask me to do...

232
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,333
By the way, you're back late...

233
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,898
Yeah... Busy day today...

234
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,448
Too many patients...

235
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,119
I went to the hospital to surprise you...

236
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,263
But they said you'd left...

237
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,876
Must've been -- When I went over to a friend's...

238
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,855
I saw you with someone in the cafeteria on my way out.

239
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,360
Who was he?

240
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,075
About time...

241
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,375
I told you...

242
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,632
He's an old friend... Raj...

243
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,738
He knew Dad too...

244
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,532
He's proposed to me...

245
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
I wasn't even thinking --

246
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,859
But -- He's not taking a 'no'.

247
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,587
Vishal...

248
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,720
My life's been very lonely...

249
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:21,570
With your Dad...

250
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,185
And now without...

251
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,960
With all my insecurity...

252
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,035
Having someone with me...

253
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:37,927
To be honest... It felt really...

254
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,503
Nice... Comforting...

255
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,390
But -- Before I decide anything...

256
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,940
I'd ask you -- Pari -- Laxmi...
-No... Mum -- No...

257
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,767
No.

258
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:02,394
No... Don't do this...

259
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,690
I...

260
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,289
I don't want to lose anyone after Dad... No -- Please...

261
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,077
What will I tell my friends?

262
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:17,115
How can I face the world?

263
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,640
I -- I know it's been hard on you...

264
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,680
But -- You've got me...

265
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:29,880
I'll do as you say -- I promise...

266
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,605
But please... Don't do this...

267
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,955
Please, Mum... No...

268
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,839
Okay, park it right here...

269
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,620
Thank you so much! For all of this...

270
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,492
Anytime, Uncle...

271
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:27,304
It's my duty...

272
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:28,978
Thank you.

273
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,635
Hey...

274
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,470
You didn't attend the wedding?

275
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:51,020
Just a bit busy, you know... Sorry!

276
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:54,881
I was waiting...

277
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:58,197
In fact, everyone was waiting...

278
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,865
I'll be there at your wedding.

279
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,023
No way you can miss mine...

280
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,310
He's an old friend... Raj...

281
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,691
He's proposed to me...

282
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,357
Hello?

283
00:24:57,544 --> 00:25:01,098
Where were you? I've been calling for ages!

284
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:04,422
Sorry...

285
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:07,035
I wasn't in my room.

286
00:25:07,276 --> 00:25:08,664
What happened?

287
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:11,194
You don't sound okay...

288
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,074
Nothing...

289
00:25:14,192 --> 00:25:17,375
Just... Not really feeling myself...

290
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,844
Lemme guess. Something happened there. Because of me.

291
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:25,073
Not you...

292
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:30,782
There's a lot else to worry about...

293
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:34,152
You can still tell me if you like...

294
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,310
There's things...

295
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,533
I can't even tell myself...

296
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,512
Telling me... May help?

297
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:54,803
You don't hide anything from me...

298
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,920
I'll tell you...

299
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,669
But not today...

300
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,357
The pics were lovely, by the way. I was looking at them...

301
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:09,554
Even in your worry?

302
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,520
That's when I miss you the most...

303
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,832
When I'm worried...

304
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,956
You didn't send me the pictures of the wedding today though.

305
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,110
I --

306
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,560
I wasn't there...

307
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,440
Why?

308
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,487
Something -- Came up...

309
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:33,219
What?

310
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,224
He...

311
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:40,472
Sent a proposal for me...

312
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,260
Who?

313
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:50,043
The neighbour's son...

314
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,670
The Captain...

315
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,173
It was his sister's wedding...

316
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,023
A -- And?

317
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:12,890
And his Mum talked to Granny. Granny likes him, but...

318
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,190
We'd rather not want me married to a soldier...

319
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,437
Have you met him?

320
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,962
Aye... A couple of times...

321
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,630
He dropped Granny and Grandpa home today.

322
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,070
He asked why I wasn't there.

323
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,758
He's nice...

324
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:37,553
Good-looking... Pleasant...

325
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:45,408
In fact, he even knows about our row... I don't really remember, but... He said he wrote a lot of comments...

326
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,842
What's his name?

327
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,820
Cüneyt.

328
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,868
Is he there in the pics?

329
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,375
Maybe...

330
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:59,156
He was on the dance floor.

331
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:00,700
Why d'you ask?

332
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,626
N -- I -- No, I ain't asking --

333
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,750
I don't want to marry a soldier, Vishal...

334
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,620
I want to live a normal life...

335
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,790
Not die everyday like your Mum and mine...

336
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,191
I don't want to be uncertain every waking moment...

337
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:24,327
I want my husband to come back home from work every evening.

338
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:28,837
I don't want to send him off to conflict zones or exercises for months...

339
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,104
Why are you quiet?

340
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:42,004
What's your ideal man like?

341
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,833
I mean...

342
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:47,235
What kind of a man would you like to marry?

343
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:52,072
Someone...

344
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:56,114
Who's a good friend... Kind... Gentle...

345
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:59,984
Someone with a lot of patience! Enough to listen to everything I say...

346
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:04,169
Someone who understands me... Someone who can feel my pain...

347
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,918
Sounds like me.

348
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,160
I'm kidding...

349
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,729
We can have a Turkish together, can't we?

350
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,205
Of course...

351
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,135
You can't be serious... Seriously...

352
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:34,024
Aye...

353
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,392
Seriously...

354
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,704
What's your ideal girl like?

355
00:29:39,704 --> 00:29:42,289
What'd you look for in a girl?

356
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,578
I'd like...

357
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,898
Someone lovely...

358
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:54,540
Doe-eyed...

359
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,650
With silky long tresses...

360
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:03,080
Someone who, decked up for a party...

361
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:07,105
Would take my breath - and words of praise - away...

362
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:13,740
Whose enchanting smile would make me want to make that moment stay forever...

363
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,753
Whose tears I'd like to line on my fingertips...

364
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:22,680
Like pearls dripping from the oceans of her eyes...

365
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,097
And never let go...

366
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,159
Someone who can share anything with me... Someone who'd like to know my deepest secrets...

367
00:30:32,241 --> 00:30:34,950
Someone who'd love to have a tiff...

368
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,900
Who'd be cross with me...

369
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,377
Who I'd try make up to...

370
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,615
Whose words...

371
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:44,480
Are as sweet as honey...

372
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,860
And whose bitterness...

373
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,089
I'd drink like a heavenly nectar...

374
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,007
Well, good luck... I doubt you're ever gonna find her...

375
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,336
What if I said I've found her?

376
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,418
You didn't tell me...

377
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,980
Why don't you look for her yourself?

378
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,260
You know me inside out.

379
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,566
Hello?

380
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,581
Hello?

381
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,040
Hello?

382
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,180
I can't hear you, Vishal...

383
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,970
I can't hear you, Vishal...
-Hello?

384
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,227
Hello?
-I'm losing the signal...

385
00:31:44,227 --> 00:31:45,323
I'm losing the signal...

386
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:47,758
Hello? Sarah?

387
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,680
Cüneyt's a proper nice lad...

388
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,970
Everytime I see him...

389
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,497
He reminds me of Sherali...

390
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:49,915
Aye...

391
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:53,003
He's a real gentleman...

392
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,030
A good kid from a nice family...

393
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,730
His Mum talked about Sarah again.

394
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,278
We don't get to decide that.

395
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,720
It's Sarah's decision. And Amna's.
-But still...

396
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,856
We can tell them what we think...
-Of course.

397
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:12,965
But... I'm troubled...

398
00:33:12,965 --> 00:33:15,590
Amna was right...

399
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:17,355
Sarah...

400
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:21,745
Shouldn't marry a military man...

401
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,280
No idea why...

402
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,810
But when I see Cüneyt...

403
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,186
It feels like Sherali's back...

404
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,442
I'd like someone lovely...

405
00:33:52,442 --> 00:33:55,703
Doe-eyed...

406
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:58,528
With silky long tresses...

407
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,112
Someone who, decked up for a party, would take my breath - and words of praise - away...

408
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:08,978
Whose enchanting smile would make me want to make that moment stay forever...

409
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:13,970
Whose tears I'd like to line on my fingertips...

410
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:19,421
Like pearls dripping from the oceans of her eyes... And never let go...

411
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:22,190
Someone who'd love to have a tiff...

412
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,070
Who'd be cross with me...

413
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,709
Who I'd try make up to...

414
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,649
Whose words are as sweet as honey...

415
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:36,812
And whose bitterness I'd drink like a heavenly nectar...

416
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,138
It ain't me...

417
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,743
It can never be you, Sarah...

418
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,480
Our faiths divide us...

419
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,977
As does a border...

420
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,487
It's a wall neither can vault...

421
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,617
This him? Cüneyt?

422
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,590
How'd you know?

423
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,027
He's an enemy...

424
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:58,886
<i>My</i> enemy... How could I miss him?

425
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,627
Pray for me, okay?

426
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,668
Pray I do well on the test...

427
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,733
Ye tell Sunanda?

428
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,398
Not yet.

429
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,909
Anyway... I'm getting late... I'll get going...

430
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,320
God bless yer. Good luk.

431
00:36:57,577 --> 00:36:58,900
Granny...

432
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,340
Hmm?

433
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,970
If you...

434
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:08,617
Talk to Sarah's Granny...

435
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:11,165
Don't tell her, okay?

436
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:14,964
I don't want her to know I'm joining the Army.

437
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:18,123
Why?

438
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,140
I've told her...

439
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,376
I got into engineering school...

440
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,444
Okay...

441
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,770
Helloo

442
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:02,930
Pray for me, will you..? Got an important exam today....

443
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,552
Always prayin'... which university, by the way...

444
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000

445
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,280
You're the only one who can stop Vishal from joining the Army...

446
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,220
No -- He got into Engineering, didn't he?

447
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,167
They lied to you.

448
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,704
Why'd you make promises you can never keep?

449
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:52,680
Life forces you into things you never want to do...

450
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,944
You didn't want me to join the Army... But now, you've gotten engaged to a soldier...

451
00:39:56,944 --> 00:39:59,301
You started it...

452
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:03,062
And you're gonna end it...
