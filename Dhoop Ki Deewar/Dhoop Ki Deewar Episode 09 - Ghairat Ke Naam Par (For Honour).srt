Episode 9 - 'For Honour'

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,128
Thermal properties are those properties of a material...

22
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,568
'Granny'
-Which are related to its conductivity of heat.

23
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:39,958
Which are related to its conductivity of heat.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,639
In other words...

25
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:46,300
These are the properties that are exhibited by a material...

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,465
'Granny'
-These are the properties that are exhibited by a material...

27
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:51,046
When heat is passed through it...

28
00:01:51,046 --> 00:01:52,956
'In class......'
-When heat is passed through it...

29
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:53,936
'In class...... Will call later'
-When heat is passed through it...

30
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,856
'In class...... Will call later'
-Thermal properties come under the broader topic of the physical properties of materials...

31
00:01:55,856 --> 00:02:00,800
Thermal properties come under the broader topic of the physical properties of materials...

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,690
'Sarah'
-Thermal properties come under the broader topic of the physical properties of materials...

33
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,680
'Sarah'
-Material with a high thermal conductivity at a constant temperature will conduct heat well both ways.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,950
Material with a high thermal conductivity at a constant temperature will conduct heat well both ways.

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,260
That's the definition... Any questions?

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,672
Sir -- Loo... May I go to the loo?

37
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,508
Focus! Go.

38
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:24,480
Thank you.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,551
Alright, and what about the light? Does that bother you?

40
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,381
Yeah, sometimes.

41
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:33,547
And you're saying it's only frontal -- Excuse me...
-Yeah...

42
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,672
Yeah, Mum?

43
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,390
Where's Vishal?

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,216
In class?

45
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:44,630
Yeah, of course --

46
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:49,910
But -- Oi called 'imself an' he didn't answer...

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,959
I'm sure he's just busy in class...

48
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,039
That better be it.

49
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,119
What happened?

50
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:01,240
Something you're hiding?

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,711
Hello?

52
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:07,141
I hope I didn't disturb you.
-You did.

53
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,220
I'm skiving off physics...
-What'd you say?

54
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,010
The classic. Works every time.

55
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,871
Don't tell me you said you're going to the loo.

56
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,898
Aye, had to... Can't wait 40 minutes to talk to you.

57
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:27,610
You can go back if you want... I've got another free period after this one.

58
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,689
You can go back if you want... I've got another free period after this one.
-No, we can talk.

59
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,650
No, we can talk.

60
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,088
Hey...

61
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:35,278
Didn't you... Like my song?

62
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:40,150
I never knew you've got such a lovely voice.

63
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,790
You noticed it just now? We talk - like - everyday.

64
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,920
Dunno why, but... Never paid attention to it...

65
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,748
Why am I not surprised? Anyway, how was the shocker? My song?

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,338
A pleasant shock...

67
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,790
You're quite the singer.

68
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,350
Thank you.

69
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,801
I was worried you took offence at it...

70
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:11,010
I've been listening to it on repeat.

71
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,480
It ain't <i>that</i> good either...

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,912
But I'll get there...

73
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,588
I'll be waiting!

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,930
My Mum wants to talk to your Mum.

75
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,467
Why?

76
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,320
You know... About Nadir...

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,668
Can't believe it...

78
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,969
He's our successor...

79
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:40,038
We can do anything for him...

80
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:43,718
What about you?
-Aren't you Indian?

81
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:47,189
You know daughters don't count in this part of the world.

82
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,669
Aye, the male gilleans [laddies] gotta sacrifice everything...

83
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:52,589
Come again?

84
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,051
Could you not butcher Gaelic like that?

85
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:01,330
I mean, the boys gotta sacrifice everything.

86
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,233
Oh, really?

87
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,794
I'm sure they do... When the family's got no daughters!

88
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:12,930
I always thought the girls in Pakistan are born mute... They don't say a word...

89
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,100
Oops... And I always thought the boys in Pakistan don't have brains. Now I'm pretty sure it's the same in India. Utterly brainless lot.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,888
Just say dimwits!

91
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,408
Not you.

92
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:26,082
I don't think it's <i>that</i> dim up there...

93
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:30,002
Glad there's something you like about me!

94
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,919
Muck...

95
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,063
Felt your collar?

96
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,367
Good luck...

97
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:45,750
Putting the 'out' in the 'outhouse', are we?
-N -- No -- I -- Got a call from my family...

98
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,990
Why? What do they want?

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, sir --

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,770
Take your time, mate... Gimme your best excuse... Your Mum fell sick? Granny?

101
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,804
Take your time, mate... Gimme your best excuse... Your Mum fell sick? Granny?
-No...

102
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:56,120
Take your time, mate... Gimme your best excuse... Your Mum fell sick? Granny?

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,330
Take your time, mate... Gimme your best excuse... Your Mum fell sick? Granny?
-No...

104
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,980
Listen here, kid... I heard her laugh myself...
-No, sir -- it's no one... You're mistaken --

105
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,900
You can check my phone... Here!

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,541
'Granny'? Gotta say that's creative, young man...

107
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,962
Lemme tell her you're gonna be a bit busy...
-Sir... Please...

108
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:19,580
Hello? Vishal? Where are you?

109
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,900
Good day... Are you Vishal's grandmother?

110
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,220
Aye.

111
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,740
What happened? He alright?

112
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,810
More than he should be...

113
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,209
Anyway, did you just call him?

114
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,609
Aye.

115
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:36,090
Just now...

116
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,550
I couldn't talk to him though...

117
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,522
Everything alright?

118
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,202
Yeah.

119
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:52,923
But you better tell this young man he's gonna disgrace the family if he kept on skiving off classes for random girls.

120
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,680
It was Granny, sir...

121
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,779
I can tell the difference between your Granny and your 'Granny', or should I say, your girlfriend!

122
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:10,447
And I heard what I heard! Don't you dare lie to me again. C'mon, now, back to class!

123
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,526
Who told you to start any of this?

124
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:26,597
Vijay always told you not to rent the estate to those politicians.

125
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,052
But no...

126
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:33,221
You always thought they're like us... They think like us...

127
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:37,640
Patriots and soldiers... Bound to get along...

128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,830
Who could respect us more?

129
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,560
Couldn't have been more wrong, could you?

130
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,846
Oi didn't 'av de foggiest...

131
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,650
Never thought they'd be so... Janus-faced...

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,120
They bowed before us in respect...

133
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,550
Because your son - a serving officer - was alive...

134
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,917
You've lost him.

135
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,148
We're the fallen soldier's family!

136
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,991
Is dis 'oy dis nashun rises ter salute us...

137
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:16,131
For my son's sacrifice?

138
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,863
I don't know...

139
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,862
All I know...

140
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:26,131
Is I'm not gonna sacrifice my son for your estate.

141
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:33,120
They pay the rent or not, they leave the estate or not... It's your problem!

142
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,476
Keep Vishal out of this... He's not filing any complaint, or doing anything!

143
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:46,486
Just -- Tell Pratibha to call Anurag... He can do what he wants about it...

144
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,020
Hmph...!

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm honestly starving... Mum?

146
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,087
Mum?

147
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,848
Nothing... I'll get you something... Go and change...

148
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,017
Did you tell her?

149
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:17,257
How d'you know?

150
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:22,668
But why? You know the professor was lying!

151
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:30,239
You're talking about the girl he mentioned?

152
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,609
Who're you skiving off classes for?

153
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,950
No -- Granny...

154
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,654
It's just... He saw your calls...

155
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:45,110
I got out of class to take them... He thought it's my girlfriend!

156
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,834
But you didn't take my call.

157
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:51,790
I did text you, remember?

158
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,998
Waaat text?

159
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,581
I didn't see it.

160
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:00,872
I got out of class to talk to you, but --

161
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,921
C'mon.

162
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,491
Okay.
-Go and change first. I'll get some water.

163
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,788
I'm a goner!
-God forbid...

164
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:14,947
Never say that again.

165
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,267
I'll go change.

166
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,741
What will we say?

167
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,644
Just tell them about Nadir's problem...

168
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:31,058
They may be able to help.

169
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,194
But how?

170
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,200
Can't know until we've talked to them.

171
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,910
Sherali was very close to their family.

172
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,660
Subuk's father's my friend.

173
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,800
We can tell them everything.

174
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,861
Where are they off to?

175
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:05,772
They're going to Subuk's - Dad's friend, remember? - to talk about Nadir.

176
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:09,712
But you said you're talking to Vishal's Mum.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,158
I did... But any help would matter right now, yes?

178
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:29,258
I still remember our little Sherali...

179
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:35,010
Everything... Every moment... As if it were just yesterday...

180
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,858
Aye...

181
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,218
And like yesterday... It's all past us...

182
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:46,248
There's no day when we don't miss him...

183
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,628
It's the same with all of us...

184
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,968
He's made our Unit proud.

185
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,639
Thank the Lord, who's given him such worthy children.

186
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
By the way, where's Amna?

187
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,290
She's... In mourning...

188
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,120
Sherali was a straight-A* student...

189
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,740
Subuk and Sherali used to vie for the best scores...

190
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,616
May Nadir and Bilal continue their fathers' legacy...

191
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:22,888
I pray they both - though in different years - remain straight-A* students.

192
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,135
Bilal's been selected...

193
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,169
On merit...

194
00:12:27,169 --> 00:12:31,083
He's going to the top boarding school here...

195
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,988
Bless him.

196
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,848
You've worked hard.

197
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:38,964
Anything for our kids.

198
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:43,039
But Bilal's a natural genius.

199
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,588
Just like his Dad.

200
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,101
I'm sure Nadir's the same.

201
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,208
Intelligence is inherited, after all, innit? That's what they all say.

202
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,430
Why don't you get Nadir into Aitchison too? I can help.

203
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,038
No...

204
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,590
We'd need him at our place...

205
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,565
We've got no one else...

206
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,953
Don't worry, Nasir Ali...

207
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:20,569
Nadir will make you just as proud - if not more - than Sherali. Straight A*s, I tell you!

208
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:28,557
Of course... He's been doing really well too...
-Bless him...

209
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,408
What'd Subuk say, Dad?

210
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,458
What could I tell him?

211
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,317
I couldn't dare say a word...

212
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:04,414
They think...

213
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:09,047
Sherali's son's as intelligent as him...

214
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,890
I didn't think it proper to talk to them about it...

215
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,140
Sherali always scored better than Subuk...

216
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,198
Sherali always stood first...

217
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,612
And Subuk, second or third...

218
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,959
When he said his son got into Aitchison... And a scholarship...

219
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,950
I had to say Nadir's doing no less...

220
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,469
That's when I knew we couldn't discuss Nadir's problem with them...

221
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,848
They know everyone around here...

222
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:53,545
I was worried word may get out...

223
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,873
But don't worry...

224
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,331
I'll get him a psychologist or teacher...

225
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,785
It was Sarah, wasn't it?

226
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,598
Yeah...

227
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,911
But -- First time I skived off class --

228
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:07,260
Sarah's Mum wanted to talk to you... You said you would...

229
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:15,040
Can't believe you care so much about them that you're worried about her Mum more than your studies!

230
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,678
You said you're gonna talk to her.

231
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:23,373
Don't you always listen to me like that?

232
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,170
Call them when it's okay. I'll talk to them.
-How about right now?

233
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,181
I mean -- It's still day...

234
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:38,501
Just half an hour behind Indian time...

235
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,791
So... Or anytime you pick!

236
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,268
Call her.

237
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,530
Jaysus, mate, it's a 'b', not a 'd'! 'Abacus', get it?

238
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,804
How many times do I have to tell you?

239
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,328
Sarah...

240
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,570
Get us some tea... I'll help him.

241
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,040
C'mon, show me your work...

242
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,049
Here.

243
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,617
Vishal.

244
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:38,220
Make it clear I don't want him calling our Sarah again!

245
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,428
It's on hands-free.

246
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,683
Hello?

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,508
Sarah... Mum wants to talk...

248
00:17:50,508 --> 00:17:53,721
I'm Vishal's mother, Sarah...

249
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:59,609
Vishal said your mother needs some help... For Nadir?

250
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:03,259
Mrs Colonel Sherali here.

251
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,680
Can you hear me?

252
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,130
Of course... It's Mrs Colonel Vijay Malhotra.

253
00:18:13,661 --> 00:18:19,242
Sarah told Vishal you needed some help for Nadir?

254
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,848
You asked Sarah to get some help?

255
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:26,667
It's Colonel Sherali Khan's father here.

256
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:30,378
In case it's not clear, we don't need any kind of help for Nadir.

257
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:33,085
Not least from our enemies!

258
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:37,950
You better tell your son to not call Sarah again.

259
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,032
You better tell your son to not call Sarah again.
-Grandpa...

260
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:44,592
I don't know about you, but we hold our head high in pride.

261
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:49,360
We don't need pity. Not from any of you.

262
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,208
We don't need pity, Grandpa...

263
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:57,098
There's a world of difference between helping and pitying...

264
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,579
Me grandson doesn't nade yisser granddaughter in 'is life!
-(Mum!)

265
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:10,030
Why don't yer ask 'er why she calls 'imself?

266
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,920
Is dat 'oy you've raised 'er?

267
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,067
(Just let Mum talk!)

268
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,740
Look... Whoever you are...

269
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:32,890
You better know that our Sarah's character is impeccable. If someone's been raised the wrong way, it sure ain't her.

270
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:38,838
You better tell your son not to call her every other minute.

271
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,321
Heard that?

272
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:44,760
You didn't have to say that, Mum...

273
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,630
Can't believe you're saying that, Sunanda!

274
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,880
Canny believe you're growin' so close ter me son's killers!

275
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,238
No one's growing close to anyone, Granny! Just... Being human...

276
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,159
Human...

277
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,020
Oh, yes indeed...

278
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:05,910
Don't yer dare blather aboyt 'umanity ter me!

279
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,481
Oi nu waaat you're up ter!

280
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:10,730
Get it?

281
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,395
Ain't yer two ashamed av yerselves?

282
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:20,449
Doesn't look like it.

283
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,988
You're Colonel Vijay Malhotra's family...

284
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,808
But yer dare stab me son in de back!

285
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,348
Never thought you'd ask <i>his</i> family for help!

286
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:59,288
After I told you we don't need anyone's help...!

287
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,490
What's wrong if I asked for their help?
-What's right about it?

288
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,028
Did you hear what that old lady said about us... And about you?

289
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:16,168
If you still think you should be asking me what's wrong about it, I'd just say...

290
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:19,191
Think about it when you're alone!

291
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,290
Mum? Who was talking about me? I heard my name...

292
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,950
Not you, love... It was someone else... Get your bag and come with me.

293
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,809
Vijay...

294
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,458
What happened, Mum?

295
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,822
Nathin' much, really!

296
00:22:18,388 --> 00:22:23,009
Yer don't even fale sad, eh?

297
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,781
What?

298
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:28,730
I don't feel sad?

299
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,780
I'm his wife...

300
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,931
His widow...

301
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,840
Can't believe you're doubting my grief!

302
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,150
Then why in God's name are you talking to his killers?

303
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:51,278
They're all killers! They killed my son!

304
00:22:51,278 --> 00:22:53,485
War killed him, Mum...

305
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,455
As it killed their son...

306
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,640
It hurts them all the same!

307
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,230
Can't believe you feel <i>their</i> pain!

308
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,081
You, of all the people...

309
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,237
You feel for them now, do you?

310
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,938
Yeah...

311
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,751
I do...

312
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,260
Looking at Pari and Laxmi...

313
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,160
I think of Nadir...

314
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,658
And, looking at Vishal...

315
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,657
I think of Sarah...

316
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:32,087
Orphaned...

317
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,507
Helpless...

318
00:23:33,507 --> 00:23:36,088
All the same...

319
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:42,553
What've we got besides these hollow medals?

320
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,795
Everything else... Is gone...

321
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:56,540
I'm sure Sarah's grandparents call out to their son in the middle of the night too... They tear up at the mention of his name... Just like you...

322
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,038
They're broken too...

323
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,748
And his widow...

324
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:05,899
Would hardly be different from me...

325
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:08,689
Mourning, just like me...

326
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,030
I don't know how I can tell you, but...

327
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:17,088
I don't feel any anger for them...

328
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:20,368
But I wonder how you...

329
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,182
If Sherali were here, he would never have let it happen!

330
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,341
No idea what Amna and her girl are up to!

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,688
Asking Vijay Malhotra's family for help!

332
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:07,838
As if there's no one left in Pakistan who can help!

333
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,038
Never thought they'd stoop so low...

334
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,837
Why don't you say anything?

335
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:24,307
What?
-Do I need to tell you?

336
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,967
My blood is boiling!

337
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,390
I mean -- Just look at what your daughter-in-law's been up to!

338
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,671
Sarah's been making friends with him, and she's letting her!

339
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,747
All I see... Is a mother trying everything for her son...

340
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:45,220
What?

341
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,407
She's desperate...

342
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:50,469
She's trying anyth --
-Don't...

343
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:53,517
Don't you dare jump on their bandwagon!

344
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:56,637
You disappoint me!

345
00:25:56,637 --> 00:26:01,817
You're just getting ticked off for no reason...

346
00:26:01,817 --> 00:26:04,820
Didn't you hear what she said?

347
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,687
Remember what she said about Sarah?

348
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,757
What can I do?

349
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:16,260
D'you want me to start a shouting match with them? Stoop down to their - and your - level?

350
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,444
<i>My</i> level?

351
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,549
I'm talking about our honour!

352
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,718
Honour!

353
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,088
Honour...

354
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,474
That's all we've got left, innit?

355
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:33,840
Us...

356
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,929
And them...

357
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,820
Honour's all that's left...

358
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,726
When this bloodbath's consumed everything else...

359
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,993
Don't take me wrong, Mum...

360
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,872
I'm a mother too...

361
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:40,582
How could I take you wrong?

362
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:45,630
Unlike the men here...

363
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,388
I know what you were thinking...

364
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:55,299
Who do I ask for help? Who can help my boy with this... Thing?

365
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,530
I've never stepped out of the house...

366
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,407
The only thing I don't like about Sherali... Is how dependent he made me...

367
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,948
Get whatever help you can from the Colonel's wife.

368
00:28:26,918 --> 00:28:30,225
I'll take care of Nasir.

369
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,108
You?

370
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:38,838
I've lost my son in the war...

371
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:46,018
I can't lose his son in this warmongering...

372
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,277
Where's Granny?

373
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:06,548
She didn't have her breakfast...

374
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:09,457
I gotta go, I'm getting late...

375
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:16,040
Talk to her for me, okay? You know what she's up to with this hunger strike...

376
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,689
Okay, bye.
-Okay...

377
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,907
Granny...

378
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,629
Blimey, that's some real fury!
-Waaat do yer care?

379
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:39,209
Waaat do yer care?
-I do! That's why I'm here!

380
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,403
Mum cares too...

381
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,660
Oh, you do?

382
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:54,727
Swear by me noggin dat yer or yisser Mamai are never gonna blather ter Sherali's family again!

383
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:56,088
Granny...

384
00:29:56,088 --> 00:30:00,236
What good is it? Is it gonna bring Dad back?

385
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:02,747
If it can, I swear I won't.

386
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:07,888
Waaat do we care for dem? Why do we want ter blather ter dem?

387
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:14,377
We've got enoof on our 'ands withoyt yer two botherin' aboyt whatever's 'eadin' on in their lives!

388
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,070
I'm sorry, Granny...

389
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,758
But whatever you said didn't suit you.

390
00:30:19,758 --> 00:30:22,907
They're a soldier's family... Just like us!

391
00:30:22,907 --> 00:30:26,468
Is that how soldiers talk to each other?

392
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,840
Oi don't nu why, but...

393
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,832
Oi jist felt furious...

394
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:42,470
Yer nu 'oy anger clouds me mind!

395
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:48,660
Simple! How about you think again when you're cooled off? What's the big deal with talking to them?

396
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:53,334
Why do we talk to them after all these wars?

397
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:56,632
Because whoever wins, the cold shoulder loses!

398
00:30:56,632 --> 00:31:01,995
Why do yer alwus blather loike yisser Mamai?
-I blather like Dad too!

399
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:04,933
You know he loathed war.

400
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:09,804
Remember what he'd say every time he'd lose one of his brothers in arms?

401
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:12,054
'We fire, they fire...'

402
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:15,400
'We kill, they kill...'

403
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,350
'It's gone on for decades past...'

404
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,008
'And many more, it will last...'

405
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:30,971
Isn't it time someone ended this blood feud?

406
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,347
I'll be waiting at breakfast...

407
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,528
Waiting for you...

408
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,198
She's left for work...

409
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,408
Proper row over here yesterday...

410
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:11,605
Your Granny shouldn't have said any of it...

411
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:15,717
It's hurt Grandpa and Granny... And me...

412
00:32:15,717 --> 00:32:22,767
I wanted to say sorry for it... That's why I was trying your number all night...

413
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,008
You don't need to be sorry for anything. There was nothing you could do...

414
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:32,179
You just wanted to lend a hand...

415
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:36,280
But still, your Granny shouldn't have said it...

416
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,781
I tried to explain it... But she's old...

417
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:44,962
Old habits die hard... Old people change slower...

418
00:32:45,151 --> 00:32:47,101
Aye...

419
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,177
So...

420
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,416
You gonna stop talking to me again...?

421
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,060
No idea...

422
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,947
Maybe... Yes...

423
00:33:02,027 --> 00:33:05,098
Or, maybe not... No idea...

424
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,100
I'm so confused...

425
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,131
Why don't you stop calling me?

426
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:15,830
After everything at your place? Everything your Granny said to you?

427
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,947
I can't.

428
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,898
It'd be a different story if Dad were here...

429
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:27,639
He was very liberal...

430
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,899
He wouldn't mind my talking to an Indian...

431
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:34,022
Same here...

432
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:38,309
Dad would have no issues either...

433
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:43,740
But... If they were both here... I guess Granny would have no issues either...

434
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,708
Because... We wouldn't be sworn enemies like this?

435
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:52,981
I'll be getting my result anyday. Just pray I get selected!

436
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,499
May God help me fulfil Dad's dream...

437
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:59,109
I'll pray to God too...

438
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,870
But I wonder if it'll work...

439
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,650
No idea...

440
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,671
Isn't it time you got your result too? A-Levels and all? What are your aims?

441
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:14,130
Dad always wanted me to become a soldier... Like him...

442
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:21,590
If you ever joined the Army... Consider it the end of our friendship! Like, for real!

443
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,444
You blackmailing me?

444
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:26,681
Whatever you call it...

445
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,992
I can be friends with an Indian...

446
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,753
Even a soldier's son...

447
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,384
But not an Indian soldier...

448
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:38,240
No one here's gonna let me enlist...

449
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,258
Granny... Mum...

450
00:34:41,258 --> 00:34:44,128
They're gonna need me here...

451
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,160
Man of the house, remember? I'm all they've got.

452
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,342
How 'bout you try...

453
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:52,640
Software engineering?

454
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Why?

455
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,480
My laptop likes to act up at the wrong moments! Make yourself useful!

456
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,060
Wow, you're selfish.

457
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,190
Aren't you?

458
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,720
I've never asked anything of you.

459
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,990
Don't you dare, either! I hate boys who order girls around like that!

460
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,771
Oooh, that sounds like my Granny!

461
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:17,572
You're gonna be like her when you're old...

462
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:22,650
You know, a brutal, cruel, dangerous matriarch!

463
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,001
Okay, stop that comparison...

464
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,592
I really like your Mum...

465
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:33,040
I wish to become like her...

466
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,761
Not your Granny.
-Wait until you talk to her...

467
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:41,266
I don't want to.

468
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:48,210
I pray God cools you off by the time she cools off! Madame?

469
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,920
Can't say...

470
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
