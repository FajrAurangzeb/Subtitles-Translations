Episode 11 - 'Hate or Love?'

21
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,681
When'd you remember you had a daughter?

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,768
How could I forget her?

23
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,442
I love her so much.

24
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:38,460
You do? Funny I didn't see it when you kicked me out.

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,440
I didn't kick you out. You picked a row and left.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,794
Just forget it and give her the good news!

27
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:51,750
Aye, forget it... I just called...

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,878
To give you the news...

29
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:57,201
That Sarah's got her result.

30
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,411
Straight A*s!

31
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:02,593
She'll get into medical college.

32
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:04,334
Congratulations.

33
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:07,614
Turns out you didn't miss me at all...

34
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:10,760
You just wanted to share the news about your granddaughter.

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:18,660
She's your niece too! I just called so you could, maybe, congratulate her yourself?

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,808
That insolent girl? Don't even think about it.

37
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:27,119
I ain't congratulating anyone.

38
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,608
What happened? Lost the signal?

39
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,959
She hung up.

40
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,258
What?

41
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,850
Hello?

42
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,778
Rabia?

43
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,488
Good day, sir. This Sarah Sherali's place?
-Good day.

44
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:08,918
Of course.
-Sweets for her.

45
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,209
Sweets?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,673
From where?

47
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,284
India.

48
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,413
Could you sign this here?

49
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,058
Here.

50
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:43,757
Thank you.

51
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,598
What's that?

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,390
Sweets for your sweet little granddaughter!

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,266
Ah, the sweet smell of success!

54
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,028
Who sent it?

55
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:17,199
Pretty sure it's her Uncle Badar.

56
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,619
No!

57
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,011
It's from India!

58
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,299
Vishal sent this!

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,459
Why'd you receive it? You could've just returned it.

60
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:35,100
You wanted me to tell that to the delivery boy? I don't want to create a scene!

61
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,470
What's up, Dad? What happened?

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,278
I'll tell you what's up. I told you to talk it straight with Sarah.

63
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:48,433
But no... Now they're exchanging sweets! What's next?

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,100
By the way...

65
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,407
How'd they find out about Sarah's result?

66
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,738
I told his Mum.
-You?

67
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,957
You talked to her again?

68
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:19,725
We've hurt each other every way we can.

69
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,945
What's left?

70
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:28,161
It's just some sweets. Big deal. We even exchange sweets with enemies...

71
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:31,199
Besides...

72
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,169
You know we ain't getting anything from our families...

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,620
We'll get even...

74
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,659
Send them something when it's time...

75
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:57,171
There will be no dues... No favours...

76
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:03,691
Right... Left... Right... Left... Right... That's good. C'mon.

77
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:09,399
Just a minute, Vishal... I forgot my handbag.
-We'll be waiting in the car.

78
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,966
They're coming with us?

79
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:16,446
Yeah. Gotta get some things for them on the way...

80
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,590
We can get it later...

81
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,621
I told you I won't enjoy with the kids around...

82
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,230
And I told you I can't leave them home while I show you places...

83
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,930
So, we're gonna be waiting in the car. Let us know if you're coming, okay?

84
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,868
Let's go!

85
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,948
What?

86
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,341
Balloons! Vishal! Stop here!
-Yeah, get me one!
-Aye...

87
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,172
Okay, just lemme park the car...

88
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:59,730
If we keep stopping like this every other minute, we're done sightseeing...

89
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,181
This is gonna be quite a sight to see!

90
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,868
Need some help?
-No, I'm done...

91
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:28,398
I don't usually enter the kitchen with Gopi around...

92
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:29,870
When's he coming back?

93
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,940
A couple of days, at the most...

94
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:39,000
Did Mum say anything to you?

95
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,015
No?

96
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,228
About Vishal and Neha, I mean...

97
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,030
Vishal and Neha?

98
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:50,170
Their marriage.

99
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,919
Are you serious?

100
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,079
He's just a kid, Pratibha!

101
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:02,975
He ain't a kid anymore... He's 18!

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,310
I found someone good, so I thought I'd do something for my nephew.

103
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,670
She's a Canadian nationality holder. You know how influential her family is.

104
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,290
You don't get matches that good that easily. He can study if he wants... Or start a family...

105
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:24,680
Vishal's my only son. Who'd be here with us if he left for Canada?

106
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,170
D'you think we can manage without him? Mum, me, Pari, and Laxmi?

107
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,770
I don't want him to leave you either...

108
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,820
I just meant he could think about his future... And take you along...

109
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,350
Besides, you've got so many problems here...

110
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,110
Aye, but we're used to 'em.

111
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,454
Anurag asked me to talk to you about it...

112
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,650
I can't tell him you told me what you did...

113
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:05,468
He said we won't need our share of the estate if Vishal accepts this proposal...

114
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,727
Please, Pratibha...

115
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:14,508
How long has it been since your brother's death? And you're talking about Vishal's marriage?

116
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:18,619
Take your time. We're not in a hurry.

117
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,949
They make a good couple. It's a good match.

118
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:26,860
That's what Mum thinks too... I think Vishal's interested too...

119
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,923
Oh, please...

120
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,530
What's up with Grandpa and Granny?

121
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,708
What'd they say?

122
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,594
Nothing.

123
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,521
I just saw it on their faces...

124
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,870
What's this?

125
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,878
It's for you.

126
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,095
Me?

127
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,378
Grandpa received it.

128
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,700
I didn't ask him to send anything...

129
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,740
Did you tell him about your result?

130
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,040
Vishal... How 'bout a picture?

131
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,463
Sure.

132
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,130
'With my Handsome Hunk'?

133
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,080
'Neha Sharma is with Vishal Malhotra at Urban Market'?

134
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,428
He never mentioned her...

135
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,220
'Neha Sharma is with Vishal Malhotra at Urban Market'

136
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,293
Why didn't he tell me?

137
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,039
And that place smelled like butter! Did you notice?

138
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:36,329
Whoa... Looks like you two visited all of Amritsar!

139
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:41,289
Aye.
-Hardly... Vishal couldn't leave Pari and Laxmi for a moment...

140
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:46,170
You didn't have to take the kids along... I mean, it's so hot! Enjoyed anything?

141
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,030
So, Vishal... When are you taking her to Mumbai?

142
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,164
Mum --

143
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,274
Mum -- Bai?

144
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,321
Aye. And then... Agra. Right, Neha?

145
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,435
I gotta have a bath... Getting all sweaty in the heat...
-Sure...

146
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:09,935
Show me what you've got.
-C'mon, you two gotta change...

147
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:13,490
Indian dresses! Isn't that a nice colour?
-C'mon.

148
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,600
Blimey, it's so pretty. Was it on sale?
-Of course. Everything was. I got everything I could!

149
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,229
It's so nice... Lemme see...

150
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,619
Nawab always stays at his place a week longer than he's supposed to...

151
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,638
I talked to Vishal's Mum...

152
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,888
When?

153
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,788
Last night...

154
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,557
And?

155
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:45,598
She's nice.

156
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:47,698
Warm. Humble.

157
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,900
Don't say I didn't tell you. What'd you talk about?

158
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:59,709
What else? She told me about Vishal's Dad... I told her about yours...

159
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,760
We gotta talk again today...

160
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:11,670
She sent a few things on WhatsApp... Teaching techniques for dyslexic kids...

161
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,920
Vishal sent the numbers of two psychologists... Did you get an appointment?

162
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,670
Aye. One of 'em's not in Pakistan right now. The other isn't free for 90 days.

163
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,968
We can visit him in Lahore... Or Karachi...

164
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:30,838
I can go to Karachi...

165
00:15:30,838 --> 00:15:33,429
Your Uncle's there too...

166
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,449
Did you tell him about my result?

167
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,079
Yeah.

168
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,458
And?

169
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,378
He congratulated me...

170
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,919
Before saying he's busy...

171
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,529
Your Grandpa and Granny have had some...

172
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:28,550
I've given some to Nadir and Noria...

173
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,240
So...

174
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,150
Forget where it's from and have it...

175
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,990
After all... It's for your result.

176
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,938
What happened?

177
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,210
I would've felt like celebrating if Dad were here...

178
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,790
I've been calling for ages. Where've you been?

179
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,801
I called you too. Where've you been?

180
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,318
What, you settlin' scores now?

181
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,197
Why would I?

182
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,213
I mean --

183
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,660
Nothing... I just... Took my Aunt shopping and all... Sightseeing, you know?

184
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,817
<i>Just</i> your Aunt?

185
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,258
Aye.

186
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:19,013
I got your sweets. Why'd you send me?

187
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,640
Who asks that?

188
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,508
You didn't have to spend a couple thousand...

189
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:28,738
Big deal. I just wanted to share my happiness...

190
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,581
Aren't you happy?

191
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,592
It wasn't necessary, this... Politesse...

192
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:35,000
It wasn't necessary, this... Politesse...
-Polit -- What?

193
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,237
Oh, nothing much... Something unnecessary, really...

194
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,348
Something wrong?

195
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:45,673
No. What could be wrong with me?

196
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:49,706
Did you mind it? Me sending you sweets...

197
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:52,302
Why'd I mind it?

198
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:56,934
First and only box of sweets I got for my admission...

199
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,030
Anyway, I gotta go... Dinner time... Bye.
-Hey --

200
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,254
Why'd you lie to me?

201
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,470
Gee, I literally bought everything I could see! I was worried Vishal would say something, but he's so nice...

202
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,730
It's nothing...

203
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,620
I mean -- Nothing... I just... Took my Aunt shopping and all... Sightseeing, you know?
-He got me everything I wanted.

204
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,249
I mean -- Nothing... I just... Took my Aunt shopping and all... Sightseeing, you know?
-What else did you do?

205
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:15,150
I mean -- Nothing... I just... Took my Aunt shopping and all... Sightseeing, you know?
-Shopping, shopping, and more shopping!

206
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,500
<i>Just</i> your Aunt?
-Shopping, shopping, and more shopping!

207
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,680
<i>Just</i> your Aunt?
-Really?

208
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,690
Yeah, we went to the Haat...
-Get anything for me?

209
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:27,010
Of course, I did! Shoes, dresses, you name it! Everything!

210
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,148
We could go on, but Vishal said he had to get back...

211
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,818
I lied to you

212
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:45,820
I

213
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,430
I k

214
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:46,990
I kn

215
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,536
I kno

216
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:49,972
I know

217
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,490
How d'you know I lied to you

218
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,110
You didn't tell me about Neha

219
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,880
Hello?

220
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,131
What, you a crystal gazer now?

221
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,622
Why?

222
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:58,896
How d'you know about Neha?

223
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,158
Go and check your timeline...

224
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:06,630
She's my Uncle's niece...

225
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,558
Here from Canada on a tour of India...

226
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,740
Why did you hide it from me?

227
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,440
What's the worst I could've said?

228
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,128
Nothing, aye... I'm sorry... Shouldn't have done it...

229
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,869
That why you're angry?

230
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:30,278
It's your personal matter... Why'd I be angry?

231
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,700
You saw all her pics?

232
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,270
Aye. All your selfies with her.

233
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,967
Lovely.

234
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,930
That's not what I -- She's a bonehead, that cow!

235
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,528
Oh?

236
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:55,719
She thinks you're a handsome hunk. You think she's a bonehead. Yet you're there, happily taking selfies with her all day.

237
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:55,940
Hy

238
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,260
Hypo

239
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,780
Hypocrite.

240
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,740
Jaysus -- She's crazy about these selfies and stuff -- Not me!

241
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,480
She doesn't even care what my family's going through!

242
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,236
All she cares about is her long list of PlAcES tO gO and tHInGs To bUy!

243
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:11,778
Okay, enough with the explanations...

244
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,168
Who else can I tell?

245
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,178
D'you mind her going out with me?

246
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,480
Why'd I mind it?

247
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,118
But I do mind you lying to me...

248
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:28,168
The least I can expect as a friend is you telling me the truth...

249
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,728
Okay...

250
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:34,669
I won't lie again... I'm really sorry...

251
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:36,360
Please...

252
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,899
Want me to sing your anger to sleep?

253
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,797
What d'you mean?

254
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,757
Don't try anything cheap.

255
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,888
No need to sing anything for me or my anger...

256
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,738

You gotta try... How can you convince Vishal and Sunanda if you don't talk to them?

267
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:49,490
'Tis their life, Anurag... Oi canny force dem.

268
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:54,030
Who's forcing anyone? It's for their best...

269
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:59,775
Vishal's all set for life if he got married to Neha.

270
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,499
Why don't you get it?

271
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:05,219
I've been trying to tell her for ages...

272
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:09,048
But who knows what's going on in her mind?

273
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:14,250
No one in my place would've cared so much about you...

274
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:20,040
But... You're family... I'm doing what's best for you...

275
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,063
Sorry if I disturbed you! I'll be back...
-Nah, Oi ain't jammers at al'...

276
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:27,720
Aye, we're talking about you. It's best if you heard it.

277
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,676
About me?

278
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:31,452
Hey.

279
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:33,515
How are you?

280
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,340
Great. You?

281
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,330
Not so much. Thanks to your Granny and Aunt.

282
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,883
Why? What happened?

283
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:45,285
Why don't you tell him, Mum?

284
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,557
Vishal...

285
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,290
Anurag an' yisser Aunt...

286
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,390
Want ter git yer married ter Neha...

287
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,291
Aye. She's a good match for you. Smart, stylish... Your type.

288
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:08,720
She just got into college... She's the type they all want...

289
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,600
A nationality holder too... You'll be all set for life...

290
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,470
Anurag's found the best match for you...

291
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,601
Without Vijay around... We've gotta think about all these things...

292
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:26,390
Your career... Your life... Your life-partner...

293
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,770
Aye...

294
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,790
Thank you so much...

295
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,728
But... I don't want to get married or anything...

296
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,898
Not just yet...

297
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,400
Not anytime soon...

298
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:47,979
Besides... I don't think I'm going to Canada anytime soon... I'm fine here, Aunt...

299
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,479
Well...

300
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:55,160
Looks like they don't care about it after all...

301
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,800
Get your share and come back.

302
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,340
And if you can't...

303
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,268
Just send Neha back...

304
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,760
You won't rest until you've ruined my marriage, will you?

305
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,101
You only care about yourself... Not your daughter...

306
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,658
What's wrong with you?

307
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,477
I'm ruining your marriage? My daughter's marriage?

308
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,590
Have some sense...

309
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,446
Before you speak...

310
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:38,440
Anurag's said enoof guff already... Don't yer start nigh...

311
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,869
What's wrong with what he said?

312
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:46,710
Just accept this proposal...

313
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,709
Or give me my share...

314
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,150
You know...

315
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,449
He won't let me in unless I've got my share...

316
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,087
Hey, Vishal!

317
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:21,568
Where're we going today?

318
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,830
Umm...

319
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,910
Look... I can't marry you, Neha...

320
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,280
Just... Make it clear to Uncle Anurag, okay?

321
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,930
Sarah's the only one I'll ever love...

322
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,471
So... If I ever decided to get married... She'll be the one...

323
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,968
You... Heard it?

324
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,688
Mum?

325
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,097
How dare you even think about it?

326
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,600
You love Sarah? You gonna marry <i>her</i>?

327
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,560
You love Sarah? You gonna marry <i>her</i>?
-No way...

328
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,881
I wanted to say something else -- It just -- Slipped out...

329
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:06,340
Big mistake...

330
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,060
You'd do well to remember that!

331
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,428
You can never love her...

332
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:16,990
She can never be yours! I hope you're clear about that!

333
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,184
Of course...

334
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,304
It's not like I love her or something...

335
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:22,870
It's just -- Plain impossible!

336
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,140
I just needed something to get rid of Neha...

337
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,408
How could <i>I</i> love <i>her</i>?

338
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,828
And -- Just why?

339
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,807
Look into my eyes and say that again, Vishal!

340
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,768
You shouldn't have to ask me!

341
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:51,428
How could <i>you</i> love Sarah?

342
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,438
Yeah?

343
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,678
And why?

344
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
