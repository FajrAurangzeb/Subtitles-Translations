<i>Every promise, every vow, every oath,</i>

00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:25,354
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

3
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:29,454
<i>Heart and soul mine, cry both,</i>

4
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>In this life, trapped...</i>

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,327
<i>I'm whiling away sleepless nights</i>

6
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>And restless days,</i>

7
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,630
<i>Searching for you in the dark anights,</i>

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,241
<i>Hoping to see you through the haze...</i>

9
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,450
<i>Who's gonna stop these tears from falling?</i>

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,161
<i>There's just this wall,</i>

11
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:57,236
<i>Just this wall,</i>

12
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:58,670
<i>That's betwixt us,</i>

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>That's betwixt us, standing tall...</i>

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,060
<i>There's just this wall,</i>

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>Just this wall,</i>

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>That's betwixt us,</i>

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,605
<i>That's betwixt us, standing tall...</i>

18
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,990

Episode 8 - 'My Friend, My Compeer'

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something wrong?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny and Grandpa didn't say anything when I greeted them.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something you said? Or Uncle?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Grandpa heard you talking to Vishal last night.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He asked me, and I told him about him.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who wouldn't be furious? Don't say I didn't warn you.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sort it out.
-How?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you gonna say? 'You can't stop me from talking to the boy whose father --'
-Please, Mum... He's something else too... Something much more...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lost his father too...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, that's why they don't want to talk to us either.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're outta your minds, you two.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think you can sing a duet on social media and win hearts all over... We've shed each other's blood.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know...

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>We've both shed blood... Both lost... And hurt...</i>

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why we talk...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurt? What d'you want to say?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think your Dad's heroism is something that hurts us?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare say that to your Grandpa and Granny.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure Vishal doesn't dare either. Remember the slap he earned for talking to you?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Mum wants to talk to us. You and me.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Us?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants to help.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out to lunch?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd she want to help us?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who asked for her help?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is it that you want from them?</i>

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nadir's teacher told me -- the other day...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's got a learning disability... Probably dyslexia...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't figure it out, so I talked to Vishal... He said his Mum's a psychiatrist who's worked with SEND kids...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the big deal if I talked to him about it?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've talked to me...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should've told me what his teacher said.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you're looking for help in India... As if we haven't got anyone who can help here! And -- Did you have to ask him of all the people?
-Mum -- I was too troubled to think! I didn't want to trouble you!</i>

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't even know if she was right about what she said...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Could you - any of you - not get up my nose for a change, like, ever?</i>

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My brother doesn't want to talk to me because of you...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never stepped out of the house, but I've got no end of things to do out there!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you think we've got who can help us? But you had to create another mess!

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For Christ's sake... Just spare me! Please!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, it's Mrs Brigadier Malhotra, Colonel Vijay Malhotra's mother...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought if you could help me...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rented the place my husband got after his retirement out...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The tenant doesn't want to leave...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll give you all the details...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he's very rude... Almost threatening...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want him out this month. Because I want to sell it right away.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay. Thank you.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny's talking to someone from the Unit...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to see them tomorrow...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure the Army can kick them out.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They can't do nothing... Even the Army's powerless before the sort your Granny's rented that place to...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad tried to stop her, but when does she listen to reason?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all just... Brahmin sentiment to her... Thought it'd be nice if someone her class... From the party she's always rooting for... Could stay there... Yet here we are...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're nothing before the Army...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a hero's son... I'm sure they'd show some respect...

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Respect'...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's millions like you in the billion people here... A bunch of them lose their lives everyday... How many d'you think they'd respect?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why're you so bitter?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not bitter. Just realistic.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've made an order to show cause...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my 'long and unexplained leave'.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They know everything...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, just tell them?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying to... I'm writing my reply...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the late Colonel Vijay Malhotra's widow...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry I couldn't attend to my duties because of my husband's sudden and unexpected demise.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The nation wants sacrifices...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not excuses...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all it asks of its people...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say something, will ya?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How d'you know?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can hear it in your voice.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're troubled.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad shouldn't have left us...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not like this... Not so soon...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm thinking too... We needed him here...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grandma's estate... The one Aunt wants a share in...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has been taken over by the tenants.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. We gotta do something. And do it quick. Aunt's coming in two days. No way she's gonna take this nicely.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you talk to the Unit? They'll throw them out in a moment.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did... But nothing happens in a moment...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They told me I have to file an application...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which I did... Let's see...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, did you talk to Mum... About that... Thing?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grandpa's found out I talk to you.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That why you're worried?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one wants to talk to me...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suddenly, I'm the traitor...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that... You telling me you can't talk to me anymore?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't talk to anyone like I talk to you... But when I talk to you...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurts everyone.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They think I'm talking to the son of the man who --

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, so am I. Talking to the girl whose father killed mine...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, how long d'you want to keep at it? I need to know when I should come back on Facebook.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sarah?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can I... See you on Skype?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, I get it... Fraidy-cat ain't gonna show me her face.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be stupid to think I'm so stupid.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think I'd do all you want...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you want it?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In your dreams, perhaps, but never for real...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a soldier's daughter, but I'm smart.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're weird... Really.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The different sort...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The memorable sort...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You there?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did I stick around too long?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you mind it? Me saying that...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(What now...?)

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sarah...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, I --

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you're very...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I want to say is --
-Anyway, I'm honestly sleepy...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta get some rest. Bye.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, good night...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The stars and the heavens above...

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you in another part of the world...

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Every promise, every vow, every oath,</i>

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Heart and soul mine, cry both,</i>

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In this life, trapped...</i>

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't be too sure, but... I think he's dyslexic.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I asked your daughter to consult a psychologist.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've never even heard of it before.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is his problem, exactly?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just a learning disability. Many kids have one. It can be managed if addressed on time...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- He never had any problems before...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think Nadir's just disturbed and upset... After my husband's death...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's upset... But that's got nothing to do with this.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he had this problem before... Perhaps no one could identify it...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did when I started taking his classes a few months back.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't talk to you about it before, but now that you're here, I think we should do something about it.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you happen to know any psychiatrist or psychologist? He can sort this out.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know any myself, but I'll see what I can do.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll try to find someone who can treat him.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you give me your number?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nadir will be fine, won't he?
- Of course.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The teacher said he'll be fine.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just a learning disability.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll get him treated before it's too late.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my only son...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he couldn't do well...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amna...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do my best.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll look for someone. Do something for him. Sort this out.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you think did all of this when wee Sherali fell ill?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could manage something back then... I sure can now...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never forget...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Age cannot wear my will.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our worries don't seem to end...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's always something...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call Badr... He may be able to help.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's in Karachi. I'm sure he'd know someone in the city...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to Rabia and Ayesha...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The doctors in the UK and the States can treat anything...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I'm sure they'll do anything they can for their brother's son...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd care for him...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?
-Fine.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something's come up --
-Why am I not surprised?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, why'd you think of me?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but I don't have the time...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry... I'm sure your in-laws can help...

211
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:41,797
Why d'you want to talk to Rabia? She left us in a fit of rage!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else have I got?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amna's brother doesn't seem to care!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it's the same with Rabia...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Ayesha?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the stuff of...</i>

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Sweet dreams, you are...</i>

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>By me in my thoughts though far,</i>

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the stuff --</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry... Lemme try that again...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the stuff of sweet dreams, you are,</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>By me in my thoughts though far,</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like the priceless gift that you are...</i>

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the thirst I crave for, you are,</i>

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Following me around like the pole star,</i>

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A feeling, unexpressed by words, you are...</i>

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You, yeah you, you've got beauty that can kill,</i>

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That draws me closer and closer still,</i>

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Chasin' my lovely daffodil,</i>

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's who you are...</i>

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The stuff of sweet dreams, you are...</i>

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the stuff --</i>

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry... Lemme try that again...

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the stuff of sweet dreams, you are,</i>

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>By me in my thoughts though far,</i>

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Like the priceless gift that you are...</i>

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're the thirst I crave for, you are,</i>

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Following me around like the pole star,</i>

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>A feeling, unexp --</i>

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're back?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said Vishal's mother can help?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know when I can talk to her.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You, yeah you, you've got beauty that can kill,</i>

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That draws me closer and closer still,</i>

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Chasin' my lovely daffodil...</i>

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She listened to it but didn't reply...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, I ain't that bad...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe, she's so mesmerised!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, I ain't that good either...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout asking her -- Nope, sounds cheap...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, forget it...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know everything.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like I talk to him in secret...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum knows about him.
-Never thought you'd be so shameless!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say that like you've known him for ages! You know who they are, right?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't we talk to millions of others?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People of every country... Every religion... How are they any different?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only because <i>they</i> don't think that way!</i>

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you ever seen how proudly they act?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How they talk about us?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember everything they said when you had a row with Vishal online?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember everything you used to tell me?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But most of all... Remember everything <i>he</i> said on TV?</i>

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It -- It was silly... Stupid of us...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only those who fight pay the price... The rest of us just... Cheer on, make noise, and -- Enjoy the circus!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sarah!

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you have to talk to Vishal?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got enough on our hands already.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't talk to him if you say...

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I just talk to him! Just talk...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've never made friends with a boy before...

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --
-It's not like I'm friends with him.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We talk because we're enemies. Sworn enemies at that.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grandpa...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever since he lost his Dad... They're going through the same mess as us... Living through the same hell...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what hurts me...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is you doubting me...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurts me a lot...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's she disappeared?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it my song...

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
... Or her family?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You, yeah you, you've got beauty that can kill,</i>

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That draws me closer and closer still,</i>

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Chasin' my lovely daffodil...</i>

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Malhotra?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, who's it?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your tenant.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Narain Saxena.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear you've filed a complaint against me...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You forced me to...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have done that...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm right here... At <i>your</i> place...</i>

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw me out if you can...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sacrifice of your son...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Save your grandson while there's time...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your bloodline risks...

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Extinction...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Long live India...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

310
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,876
I never knew you've got such a lovely voice.

311
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:43,147
You noticed it just now? We talk - like - everyday.

312
00:29:43,147 --> 00:29:44,661
Never paid attention to it...

313
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:48,190
So... How was the shocker? My song?
-A pleasant shock...

314
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:55,199
Can't believe you care so much about them that you're worried about her Mum more than your studies!

315
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:59,365
Call them when it's okay. I'll talk to them.
-How about right now?
