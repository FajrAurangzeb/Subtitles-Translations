Episode 17 - 'Another War'

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,001
Granny!

22
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,460
Vishal's here!

23
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,400
Really? Where's he?

24
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,921
Vishal!

25
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,978
How are you, dear?

26
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,448
M'lad!

27
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,068
C'mon...

28
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,467
This house was a lonely place without you... Look at it gladden the moment you entered...

29
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,988
I ain't gonna stay here too long... We're about to be redeployed...

30
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:27,147
And your Mum's gonna get back to an endless wait...

31
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:32,178
I've gotten used to it as a wife... Now I've gotta wait as a mother...

32
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm gonna take you with me this time.

33
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,110
You're just a Lieutenant... Talk about that when you're a Captain.

34
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,669
Besides, who knows where you're going?
-Aye...

35
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,520
By the way... You're done training... Enlisted...

36
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,230
How 'bout I reined you in?

37
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,248
You mean get me married? No way...

38
00:04:55,248 --> 00:05:00,739
Get engaged maybe?
-The only thing I can think of right now is food. C'mon, I'm starving!

39
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:01,610
DG ISPR told Geo News in an exclusive interview...

40
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,930
Here.
-DG ISPR told Geo News in an exclusive interview...

41
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,050
DG ISPR told Geo News in an exclusive interview...

42
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,387
Looks delicious!
-That the army will be surveying the Line of Control...

43
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:12,590
It's your favourite, innit?
-Alright, that's enough.
-That the army will be surveying the Line of Control...

44
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,790
In other news, an Indian Army convoy has been attacked in Pulwama...

45
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,700
In other news, an Indian Army convoy has been attacked in Pulwama...
-Alright, that's enough.

46
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,050
The attack claimed 40 lives...
-Alright, that's enough.

47
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,820
The attack claimed 40 lives...

48
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,850
India has declared it will make Pakistan pay for killing her soldiers...

49
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:32,100
The Chief of Army Staff has put the Army on high alert.

50
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,820
We repeat, an Indian Army convoy has been attacked in Pulwama...

51
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,730
God help us... It's all starting over again...
-In other news, an Indian Army convoy has been attacked in Pulwama...

52
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,870
God help us... It's all starting over again...
-The attack claimed 40 lives...

53
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,210
India has declared it will make Pakistan pay for killing her soldiers...

54
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,669
Have your dinner.
-India has declared it will make Pakistan pay for killing her soldiers...

55
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,450
India has declared it will make Pakistan pay for killing her soldiers...

56
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,150
The Chief of Army Staff has put the Army on high alert.

57
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,958
Dinner, Cüneyt...
-The Chief of Army Staff has put the Army on high alert.

58
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:53,740
The Chief of Army Staff has put the Army on high alert.

59
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,510
The Prime Minister has ordered surgical strikes against Pakistan...

60
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,090
Behind the tears, the nation fumes in fury...

61
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,050
What now?
-Behind the tears, the nation fumes in fury...

62
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,041
Nothing.
-Behind the tears, the nation fumes in fury...

63
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,631
Nothing.
-Yet another cowardly attack has claimed the lives of 40 soldiers...

64
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:06,791
We're at it again...
-Yet another cowardly attack has claimed the lives of 40 soldiers...

65
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,890
Pickin' a row...
-Yet another cowardly attack has claimed the lives of 40 soldiers...

66
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,177
The Army has been put on high alert until further orders...

67
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:13,988
You haven't even been deployed yet.
-The Army has been put on high alert until further orders...

68
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,858
The Army has been put on high alert until further orders...

69
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,808
Sir.

70
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:24,998
Okay, sir.

71
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,947
Hail India.

72
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,749
Who was it?

73
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,948
The Unit.

74
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:33,928
Why?

75
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,287
We're being redeployed...

76
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,938
Where?
-Where?

77
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,178
Jammu and Kashmir. The frontline...

78
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,518
Sir.

79
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:05,278
Right.

80
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,997
When do we move in, sir?

81
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,888
Affirmative.

82
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:14,998
What happened?

83
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:17,208
Who was it?

84
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,151
They're sending me to the frontlines.

85
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,922
Where?

86
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,781
Kashmir.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,167
Sarah!

88
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
What happened? Sarah!

89
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,648
Don't worry... Besides...

90
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:48,727
It's hardly unusual... We're used to standoffs like this...

91
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,471
Don't leave me...

92
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,081
You know...

93
00:07:58,081 --> 00:08:00,471
I can't do that...

94
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:06,153
How can you leave me like this?

95
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:08,434
Tell me...

96
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:11,920
If we stayed back for our wives...

97
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,695
Our kids...

98
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:17,435
Who's gonna stand guard at the borders?

99
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:22,975
I need to get going.

100
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,290
But I'll be back...

101
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,138
See you soon...

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,610
We have unprovoked firing from India in the Chirikot Sector...

103
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,150
The Indian Army unleashed automatic weapons and mortars...

104
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,096
Join us as we interview witnesses who can tell us more...

105
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:12,370
After failing everywhere else, the powerless Pakistan Army suffered yet another disgraceful defeat...

106
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,972
As the Indian Army retaliated against their cowardly attack with deadly effect.

107
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:20,482
We need to fight these terrorists...

108
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:23,420
And those who provide them refuge.

109
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,614
We need to tell those who give them refuge that they need to be extradited!

110
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,370
Fire now...

111
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,183
And you'll be safe from the snake...

112
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:34,610
But the snakes on the other side...

113
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,870
Have their guns trained on you...

114
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,985
I'm -- Afraid of snakes, sir...

115
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,730
You ain't afraid of death...

116
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,290
But you're afraid of this puny snake?

117
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:11,313
Terrorist attack in Razmak, North Waziristan... ISPR says the terrorists used an IED...

118
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:14,187
Six soldiers, including one officer, lost their lives...

119
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:18,518
The fallen include Captain Omar Farooq, Staff Sergeant Fayaz Ahmed...

120
00:13:18,518 --> 00:13:23,210
Staff Sergeant Shakil Azad, Sergeant Jonah Khan...

121
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:30,100
Lance Corporal Mohammad Nadeem and Lance Corporal Asmatullah...

122
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,798
The ISPR is here with us at Geo News...

123
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,258
What happened?

124
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:51,923
Captain Zafar's no more.

125
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,440
Military Intelligence is investigating the matter...

126
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,530
As you can see, a sinister plot to repeat Pulwama has been thwarted...

127
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:11,561
You can see the white car loaded with about 50 kilogrammes of explosives...

128
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm so sorry for your loss...

129
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,159
We're putting up our best fight.

130
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,892
I hear the Pakistan Army's suffered twice as many losses in Kashmir.

131
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,651
The Government says...

132
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:46,630
Our men have got hearts of iron...

133
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,580
They're invincible...

134
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,474
They'd know better if they stood guard at the border themselves...

135
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,031
Heroes never die.

136
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,339
Why don't you have breakfast?

137
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,616
That's the sixth we know... Gone...

138
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,690
Zafar was too young...

139
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,741
Aye, about as old as Cüneyt...

140
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,320
May he rest in peace...

141
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:30,617
May God help us all...

142
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,132
We're at it every now and then...

143
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:39,641
Why can't our nations just talk for a change?

144
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:42,740
How long can we keep fighting?

145
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,931
No one cares about soldiers...

146
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:51,770
Or their wives, their kids, their parents, their families... No one!

147
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,470
If you want war...

148
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,950
Fight and die in one shot!

149
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,626
Don't kill us every day...

150
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,610
Slowly...

151
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,020
What've wars achieved, like ever? It's all just... Chaos and destruction and death all over...

152
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,960
Talk about peace and we'll talk about peace...

153
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,940
Wage war, and we'll wage war...

154
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,240
The Prime Minister has sent a clear message...

155
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,470
We are not weaklings. We love our country to the core and we're willing to die for her.

156
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,220
After Pulwama, they seem to be caught between chest thumping and empty threats of war...

157
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,240
The Foreign Secretary wrote today...

158
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,550
Informing the UN about recent developments...

159
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,699
You didn't go to college today?

160
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:47,851
Yeah, Aunt...

161
00:16:48,085 --> 00:16:50,770
Just... Worried...

162
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,837
Had this nightma --
-Please, Sarah...

163
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,960
Don't say something...

164
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,066
That'll make my blood pressure shoot up again...

165
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,700
Guess I'm just a bit under the weather... That explains the weird nightmares and all...

166
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,830
Of course... Because...

167
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,056
Why else?

168
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,610
Did Cüneyt call?

169
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,880
I've --

170
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,841
I've been waiting...

171
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:26,970
Don't worry... He'll call you...

172
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,152
May the Lord keep him safe...

173
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:34,723
May He keep every son safe...

174
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,801
Have your breakfast...

175
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:51,052
I'm fine!

176
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:54,059
Just... Back at the base for a few days...

177
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,210
For rest, yeah... I'm going back...

178
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,007
I pray peace prevails between our nations... I pray they call the armies back...

179
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:06,431
I'm a soldier, Mum...

180
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,467
I can't wish for it...

181
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:11,477
Even if I want it...

182
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
You're fine, aren't you?

183
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,555
Of course!

184
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:18,410
It was just a fever! That's why I came here...

185
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,206
Did you take a pill?

186
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:24,510
I'm just back from the hospital. Took everything I need. Don't worry.

187
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,250
Quickly... Let me talk ter 'imself...
-Here. Talk to Granny.

188
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,787
Hello?

189
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,258
Hey, Granny.

190
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:37,852
How are you?
-Great. What could happen?

191
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:40,569
God forbid anything happen to you...

192
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:43,975
You're who we're livin' for...

193
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:47,830
Just keep praying, and I'm sure I'll be fine!

194
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,467
Waaat else do yer tink... Yisser Mamai an' Granny do al' day, everyday?

195
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,140
Those sobs are gonna drown my morale!

196
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,471
Everything's fine here... Don't worry.

197
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:08,990
We've lost many lives... De people in de neighbourhud...

198
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,390
Mum!

199
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,630
Many got the bodies of their fallen yesterday...

200
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,820
Many more didn't... Couldn't...

201
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,190
'Oy are things at de border?

202
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,481
'Oy brutal is it?

203
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,630
This is the price we pay...

204
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,235
Whenever our countries go to war...

205
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:34,730
This is the price we make each other pay...

206
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,745
Just a minute... Could I talk?

207
00:19:37,745 --> 00:19:39,840
Aye, Vishal...

208
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,279
Hello?

209
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,511
Hello?

210
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,200
Today, for an attack on an unprecedented scale, the nation craves vengeance on an unprecedented scale...

211
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,180
An attack this deadly cannot be avenged that easily.

212
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,650
We've hit India where it hurts!

213
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,970
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth... Blood for blood...

214
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,130
Why didn't you die of disgrace?

215
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:13,960
The last time someone dared threaten us, we showed him who's the boss! We didn't spare you then, we sure as hell ain't gonna spare you now!

216
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,053
Okay...

217
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,920
Give 'em a big hand!

218
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:24,176
Actors offered their tributes to the soldiers who lost their lives in the dastardly attack...

219
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,010
Those responsible for this massacre will pay...

220
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,802
And now...

221
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,854
I'm fine, Sarah...

222
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,841
I'm right here... Talking to you.

223
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,779
You alright?

224
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,022
Can't you come back?

225
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,436
I can't...

226
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,303
Look... We've got a few minutes...

227
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:07,931
Don't lose them to these sobs...

228
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:12,776
Tell me about things there... You okay?

229
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,473
Yeah...

230
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,676
Just worried...

231
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:20,929
No idea why...

232
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,724
Just... Take care of yourself...

233
00:21:23,724 --> 00:21:29,142
I know there's a lot of stress and hormonal imbalance, but...

234
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:32,796
I'm the doctor, Cüneyt, not you.

235
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:35,701
Aye.

236
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,308
That's why you gotta take care of yourself.

237
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:41,356
And the young'un...

238
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,950
When are you coming back?

239
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,382
When this ends.

240
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,499
Which means... No idea...

241
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,078
Both our armies are here...

242
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,497
Let's see how it goes...

243
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,460
I might lose the signal any second...

244
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,566
So... Tell Mum and Dad I said hi... And please...

245
00:22:02,566 --> 00:22:05,040
Take care of yourself...

246
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,855
I love you.

247
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,484
Hello?

248
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,450
Hello?

249
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,356
What was I thinking?

250
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,171
Stupid...

251
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,635
She called me after two years...

252
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,740
How'd she think of me?

253
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,695
Can't sleep until I find out...

254
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,571
Hello?

255
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,826
Hello?

256
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,818
I know you can hear me.

257
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:21,951
Aye.

258
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,801
How are you?

259
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,540
Fine.

260
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,868
You?

261
00:25:32,476 --> 00:25:34,336
Where are you?

262
00:25:34,693 --> 00:25:36,741
I'm a soldier...

263
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,836
Where d'you think I could be?

264
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:43,547
Deployed at the border...

265
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,063
Uhh...

266
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,924
I've been having this nightmare for the last few days...

267
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,555
No idea who it's about...

268
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,154
But I had this feeling it's about you.

269
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,800
That's why I called.
-Fair enough.

270
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,301
You see me in your dreams. Better than nothing.

271
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,729
I don't even dream about you now...

272
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,190
Won't you ask me what it is? The dream?

273
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,975
Go on.

274
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,277
You were deployed in Kashmir...

275
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,953
Where your Dad and mine lost their lives...

276
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:37,270
Leepa. Did you see me?

277
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,330
Aye... I saw you there...

278
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:44,005
And?

279
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,878
Nothing...
-You don't want to tell me, do you?

280
00:26:53,504 --> 00:26:55,161
Aye...

281
00:26:56,097 --> 00:27:00,544
They say you don't talk about bad dreams...

282
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,156
Where are you?

283
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,409
Somewhere... I can't tell you...

284
00:27:08,718 --> 00:27:11,526
Not Kashmir, surely?

285
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,317
No.

286
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:15,254
Thank God...

287
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,203
Cüneyt's in Kashmir...

288
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,136
Oh...

289
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,102
Where?

290
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,606
Leepa.

291
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,496
Everything alright?

292
00:27:33,496 --> 00:27:35,745
Happily married?

293
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,436
Aye...

294
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:41,603
Happily married...

295
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:42,659

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,681
You were angry...

314
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:26,446
You used to make up to me...

315
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,681
You used to make up to me...
-When there was no Cüneyt between us, aye...

316
00:28:27,681 --> 00:28:30,256
When there was no Cüneyt between us, aye...

317
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:35,217
When there were no armies between us either, aye...

318
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,040
I'll send you my kid's pic...

319
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,747
I'll be back at the border in a few days...

320
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:49,620
So if I didn't text you or call you back...

321
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,565
Don't think I've forgotten you...

322
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,831
Take care, okay?

323
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,246
And...

324
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:03,092
Don't be a hero...

325
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,180
Save yourself...

326
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,770
Did you say the same to Cüneyt?

327
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,147
He knows his slogans and war cries, just like you...

328
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,656
He doesn't listen to me either...

329
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:36,160
Why d'you soldiers forget those you leave behind? How are you able to forget what we go through?

330
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,343
Even when we can't, Sarah...

331
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,350
We know there's nothing we can do...

332
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,270
Take care...

333
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,279
If fate has it, I'll get back to you...

334
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:56,806
I've given the Unit your name and number, besides my family's...

335
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,665
They'll let you know if something happened to me...

336
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,150
So your memories come back to haunt me?

337
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,744
No.

338
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,910
So you know I could never forget you...

339
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,825
Until my last breath...
