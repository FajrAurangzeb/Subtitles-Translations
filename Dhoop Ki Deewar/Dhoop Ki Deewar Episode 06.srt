Episode 6 - 'Cold-Blooded Blood Ties'

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,791
I'm sure Sherali would've thought differently...

22
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,888
Of course...

23
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,040
I'm sure if Sherali were with us...

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,618
We wouldn't be talking about any of this...

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,570
I've got no shortage of matches for my son.

26
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,037
I just wanted to ease my sister's burden...

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,530
Sarah's no burden!

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,180
Unlike you, I'm not doing anyone here a favour...

29
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,719
It's my duty to help them.

30
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,759
I want my brother's daughter for my son.

31
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,089
We've got a right over our brother's kids before you.
-Look who's talking about rights...

32
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,410
Someone who - unlike me - couldn't care less about the responsibilities that come with it.

33
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,210
Someone who'll never bother to take them up.

34
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,630
Who asked you to do anything?

35
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,970
Why are you even here?

36
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:38,150
I can call Atif to help them with all the paperwork. But you took it upon yourself because you wanted to.

37
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,570
You couldn't even be here for Sherali's funeral!

38
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:46,501
I took care of everything here.

39
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,445
When Uncle and all the others were grieving.

40
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:59,770
Sherali's Unit took care of everything. The Army arranged for his funeral. What'd you do?

41
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,978
I don't want to talk to you.

42
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:07,820
I don't want to argue with you... Not after Sherali...

43
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,700
But let me be clear...

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,467
Sarah's not marrying anyone other than my son.

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,371
Not one of your sons!

46
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:23,330
You can't order around like that here!

47
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:30,561
I'm not ordering you around. Just... Telling what I want and asking for it...

48
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:36,712
I couldn't tell you but... I intend to take Amna and the kids along anyway.

49
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:40,821
D'you hear that, Amna? D'you hear what he's saying?

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,430
Who gave him the right to decide for you and the kids? Who the dickens is he when we're here?

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,090
Why are you acting like the kids've got no one but their Uncle? We're still here.

52
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,410
Uncle's here because they needed him. He has no interest poking his nose where it doesn't belong.

53
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:05,310
And, if Amna has a problem with his help and proposal, he will leave.

54
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,420
We're not coming with you. I'm not marrying your son. Period.

55
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,518
Sarah! Back to your room.

56
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:17,260
Why are you shutting her up? She knows what's best for her.

57
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,750
And she just said what she wants. She'd rather choose Rabia's son --

58
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,011
And she just said what she wants. She'd rather choose Rabia's son --
-I'm not marrying your blimmin' son either!

59
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm not marrying your blimmin' son either!

60
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,281
Nor yours!

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,930
I will take up all responsibilities myself. We don't need your sympathies and pity!

62
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,758
We can manage something. Take care of ourselves.

63
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:45,798
And -- Why are you even here? Go back where you're needed! Out!

64
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:52,760
Gorblimey! Hear what she's saying? Is that what you've taught her? She's kicking us out!

65
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:03,420
I've been doing all the paperwork like mad, but it appears you've grown up! You're all independent! You don't need your Uncles, Aunts, or anyone now, do --

66
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,531
Yeah. We don't.

67
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:10,471
We've got enough problems without you lot starting a bloody riot!

68
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:15,260
Mind your tongue! They're your elders!
-Well they better behave like it!

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,907
All I see is a bunch of filthy rabble-rousers, all wrapped up in their blasted selves!

70
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,620
Who told you to say anything?

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,135
Who told any of them to come here and start plotting against us all day?

72
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,253
Your mother's a widow.

73
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:47,999
You're orphans.

74
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,650
Your Uncle and Aunts are the only family we've got!

75
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,131
Can't you see we need them?
-We're not orphans...

76
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,958
No...

77
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,577
Dad's a martyr... A hero...

78
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,597
A martyr's wife...

79
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:22,938
Is as much a widow...

80
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,748
His children, as much orphans...

81
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,250
Just... Go. Right now.

82
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,004
Go back where you've come from. Go to Britain, America, or Timbuc-blasted-too!

83
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:50,925
We've got all we need in our lives here.

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,951
Thank you too, sir.

85
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,448
I'll take your leave.

Who's having breakfast so early?

117
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,228
Mr Badar. He had a flight to catch.

118
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,068
Where's he off to?

119
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,919
Didn't he tell you? He left.

120
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,458
Could you make something for me too?

121
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,388
Hey! Where are you off to?

122
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:12,959
My brother-in-law's here for me. I'm staying with him and leaving from his place.

123
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,490
But you're only jus --
-I've stayed here long enough.

124
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,210
I'd be off my head to stay here after everything Mum and Dad said yesterday.

125
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,600
I'd be off my head to stay here after everything Mum and Dad said yesterday.
-What is it that we said?

126
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,341
What is it that we said?

127
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:27,261
That you're oh-so-hurt about? But if that's what you want...

128
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,432
Have it your way...

129
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:30,842
Okay.

130
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:36,061
Without my brother to side with me... You can do as you want.

131
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:39,951
And Amna and her family can say whatever they want.

132
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:43,440
I'll get get going. I'm getting late.

133
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,229
Bye.

134
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,952
But -- Wait -- Stop her --
-Don't stop her! Let her go!

135
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,241
It's best if she leave!

136
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:59,310
But how? I'm sure she'll listen to Ayesha... I'll go get h --

137
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,520
She's gone.

138
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,620
Where?

139
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,550
To her sister-in-law. She said she's staying there. She leaves the day after tomorrow.

140
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:13,062
But -- Couldn't she tell us?

141
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:18,540
Someone's got a problem with me... And someone's got a problem with Sarah!

142
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,110
She can say sorry. We'll talk to h --

143
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,141
No one's talking to her!

144
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,407
No one's stopping them!

145
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,687
What's happened...

146
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,758
Is enough!

147
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,648
Where's the other plates?

148
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:03,716
Everyone else left, ma'am...

149
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:05,689
Who?

150
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,077
Your Uncle...

151
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:11,188
Mmes Rabia and Ayesha...

152
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:13,237
Where?

153
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,018
No idea. They all just... Packed their things and left... One-by-one...

154
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,080
So everyone's gone!

155
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,401
Everyone's here... Everyone <i>else</i> is gone...

156
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,691
Peace at last!

157
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:37,180
I'm starving! Get me everything you've got! Call Mum, Grandpa, and Granny...

158
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:40,040
This calls for a proper feast!

159
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,937
I'm honestly delighted they're all gone.

160
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:01,488
Mhm... Same here.

161
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,089
I hate Uncle... He makes Mum cry all the time...

162
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,891
Well, so does Aunt...

163
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,612
Which one?
-The younger one.

164
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:15,760
I feel like roughing up anyone who makes Mum cry.

165
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,360
And I hate it when anyone comes here...

166
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,948
I want to get out of this place... With Mum...

167
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,558
Gopi!

168
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,908
Gopi!

169
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,078
Ma'am?

170
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,566
How many ages has it been since you cleaned this room?

171
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:54,999
I couldn't get the time... Not with all the guests --
-No, thank you... I can do it myself...

172
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,627
Ma'am...

173
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,620
CoUldN'T gET thE TimE...

174
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,070
You never get the time when no one's watching, do you?

175
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,780
No... No...!

176
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,958
Gently this time, Nadir! Or I'm hitting it hard!
-Give her your best shot!

177
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,891
Aww...

178
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,910
Catch!
-Not out!

179
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:31,390
Everyone's left because of her, but look at how happy she is! I mean, she's not a kid!

180
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,913
She's a kid... Never let her grow up.
-Get the ball!

181
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:41,591
I can't stop her...

182
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:46,852
But everyone in my family and yours would be cursing her...

183
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,860
Who cares?

184
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,006
What's the worst they can do?

185
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:58,529
What could they do when we suffered our worst?

186
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,269
Nothing.

187
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,139
They'll just say a few things for a few days and move on...
-You're too slow for me!

188
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:08,272
All I care about...

189
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,680
Is being with my Sherali's kids...

190
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,769
Amna...
-Out!

191
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,553
We're all together... All in this together...
-Careful! Don't aim for my face again!

192
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:20,443
We're all together... All in this together...
-Back off a bit...

193
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,638
Come over here! Aye...

194
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,328
Waaat tuk 'imself so long?

195
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,838
Took you long enough!

196
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,518
Good day, Granny!

197
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:10,018
It's okay... I was working on an assignment, okay? Why are you worried? Did you need me?

198
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,549
No.

199
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,790
Jist a bit worried...

200
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,683
Don't be out for so long...

201
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:24,977
Granny... I don't do it on purpose...

202
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:28,966
C'mon...
-But I get worried!

203
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,257
Why'd you give up your morning walk?

204
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:33,630
Huh?

205
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,320
No idea...

206
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,831
I gave up on a lot since last month...

207
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:50,040
I'm sure you're starving.
-Actually, no... I had my lunch at the University...

208
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,588
But Oi'm starvin'...

209
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,408
I've been waiting for you...

210
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,938
Granny...

211
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,524
Please don't starve yourself waiting for me...

212
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,309
That's what Dad always said, remember?

213
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:12,019
Please, have something...

214
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,757
I will... Sure...

215
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,173
Naw wan gives up on food...

216
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,987
Back at last?
-Aye.

217
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,680
Seeing you do the chores after a loooong while... Delighted!

218
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,190
D'you see how you've kept your room? It's a complete mess! Had to do something about it...

219
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,795
You're not a kid, Vishal...

220
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,987
What are you saying?

221
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:59,578
I'm still a kid... Here...

222
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,934
Take a look...

223
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,498
Adulting suits you...

224
00:22:07,498 --> 00:22:10,397
Not this... Okay?

225
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,278
Besides, we need an adult in the family...

226
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:18,468
Not a kid...

227
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,977
I see grey hair!

228
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:30,226
Aye, they've been this way for a while... More and more turn grey everyday...

229
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,370
Dye them. Like before?

230
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,868
What good is it?

231
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,600
Black or grey... Who's gonna care? Who's gonna bother to look?

232
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:50,319
Anyway... I've arranged the clothes in your cupboard. Everything's organised perfectly. Don't make a complete haymes of it, okay?

233
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,249
Okay.

234
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:52,889
Clear?

235
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,098
Mum...

236
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,560
When are you getting back to work?

237
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,722
Soon.

238
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,911
About time... I got a letter... They can only let me take so many leaves...

239
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:13,681
Don't scatter everything everywhere!

240
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,300
I'm sorry about what Sarah said... But you shouldn't have gone like that... Without telling anyone...

241
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,910
Aye, I should've stayed there... So you, your kids, and your in-laws could insult me more!

242
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,350
And hear that I'm doing this for the money...

243
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,652
He said it in a fit of rage... You know how much we respect you...

244
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:53,810
Aye... I know only too well how much they...

245
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,411
And you and your kids respect me...

246
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:00,499
I always shut my wife up...

247
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:03,996
But now I think she was right all this time.

248
00:24:03,996 --> 00:24:06,066
But --

249
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:10,227
I'm sure the Unit will take good care of you and your kids.

250
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:13,387
I don't want your insults!

251
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,139
Hello?

252
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,848
Hear that? Your Uncle doesn't even want to talk to me!

253
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:25,658
Why do <i>you</i> want to talk to him?

254
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,727
Why d'you want him to come here?

255
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,951
He doesn't want to talk? Fine by us.

256
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,948
How can we live all alone?
-Is it any better with him?

257
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:40,557
We're more lonely with him than without...

258
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:44,744
At least... We're together... All of us...

259
00:24:54,530 --> 00:25:00,500
Oi got me ticket ter A. R. Rahman's concert. Want ter cum wi' me?
-You're going to Mumbai?

260
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,475
Without a ticket?

261
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:09,060
Vishal! Why didn't yer git yers? Oi tart yer alwus wanted ter be dare live!
-So I did...

262
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,231
But not now... Not Mumbai, sure...

263
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:18,721
Step oyt av yisser gaff for a day or two... Can't believe you're the guy who couldn't stay at his place!

264
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:21,220
So I was...

265
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,610
But not now... Got no choice... But I'm happy for you.

266
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,558
Vishal...

267
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:34,380
We want to have some ice cream...
-Okay, go. I'll come in a sec...
-No, we wanna go right now!

268
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,969
Guess I'll... See you tomorrow?
-Okay.
-Sure.
-Bye.

269
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:54,770
What's the matter, Granny? You move it around all the time!

270
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,398
Yer got a problem? It isn't dat 'eavy!

271
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,177
You'd know if you were lifting it... When do I keep it back?

272
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:07,349
Go... I'll call you when I need you...

273
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:10,390
I have to leave the kitchen for this...

274
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,630
Look... Don't ask anything of me when I'm with my friends.

275
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,708
Why?

276
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:29,010
What's with all the whys all the time?
-Dad used to take us whenever we asked him... He never said anything like that...

277
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,988
Well, I'm not Dad...
-I know...

278
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,560
Sorry... How 'bout another one? C'mon!

279
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,200
You're good... But Dad was better...

280
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,449
Enjoy yourselves...

281
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:04,428
How many more times will your younger days come back to me?

282
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:15,570
Oi never tart...

283
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,450

Oi cud never even imagine...

286

Good that you're out somewhere after long... How does it feel?

287
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,008
Here.

288
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,348
Thank you.
-Ma'am.

289
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,158
How say you order something?

290
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,987
Order what you like... Please.

291
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,909
Okay...

292
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,333
Shoot! 1-10, 1-10! Shoot! Goal! Got it!

293
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,350
Gee, you're louder than all of them... Combined!

294
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,980
But look at that fantastic goal!

295
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,541
Lovely, aye...

296
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:57,940
You're so boring... Remember how you react when Sachin hits a six? It's that kinda goal! The whole Premiership depends on it!

297
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,679
Okay... But please... Let me work...

298
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,680
As if I'm a kid!

299
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,550
Here.
-Treat yourself!

300
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,158
Grumpy as always, eh?

301
00:30:07,248 --> 00:30:09,688
Well done!

302
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,660
Sunanda...

303
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,185
What happened?

304
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,856
Easy there...

305
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,581
Sunanda?

306
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,328
Hello.
-Hello.

307
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:36,277
Why isn't Mum taking my calls?

308
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:43,080
No idea.
-She's not been online. Not checked her WhatsApp. Stopped taking my calls.

309
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,957
What's up?

310
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:48,379
What do I know?
-Give the phone to her.

311
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,757
'Sec...

312
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:52,110
Just a minute...

313
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,759
Granny... It's Aunt.

314
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,408
Hello?
-Yeah?

315
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:07,796
She turned in...

316
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,290
She doesn't turn in this early!

317
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:17,750
You can talk to her when I'm back from University tomorrow... I'd hate to wake her up right now...

318
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,858
Okay.

319
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:21,380
Don't forget it, okay?

320
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,567
Okay.

321
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,257
Okay. Bye.

322
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:25,988
Bye.

323
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,118
What's up?

324
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:42,179
Why don't you want to talk to her?

325
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,228
Oi'm weary, Vishal...

326
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,858
Oi'm weary av it al'...

327
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,247
Jist wan tin' on 'er mind...

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,738
The estate...

329
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,478
The money...

330
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:10,918
Her share...

331
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:16,278
Well, then, give her her share and sort it out forever.

332
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,537
Wan...

333
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:38,118
One last memory of your Grandpa... That's what it is to me...

334
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,258
I've lived there for so long...

335
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,777
Easy for them to say, 'Sell it'!

336
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,898
Tell me...

337
00:33:51,540 --> 00:34:00,988
Can you sell something you're so attached to... So quickly?

338
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:03,112
Can yer?

339
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,030
Don't talk to Sarah Sherali ever again! Never forget we're enemies!

341
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,940
No way I can forget that... Not with you saying it every waking moment to remind me!

342
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,549
They hate us.

343
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:46,139
We don't talk about our friends as much as we talk about one enemy.

344
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:55,190
I don't know what our elders want. Do they want to see each other or not, be friends or enemies, talk to each other or not... I mean... They're so confused!

345
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,409
Well, so are we...!
