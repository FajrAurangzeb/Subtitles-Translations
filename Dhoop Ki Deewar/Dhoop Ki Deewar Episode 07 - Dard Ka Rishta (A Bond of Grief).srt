Episode 7 - 'A Bond of Grief'

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:33,051
Could you go to Nadir's school? His teacher's been asking me... Something about his result maybe...

22
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,349
Okay, I'll leave early...

23
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,302
I could've gone if I were not in mourning...

24
00:01:38,302 --> 00:01:42,691
I could send Dad... But he may not get what she says...

25
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,737
But I'm sure... You will...

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,714
Okay...

27
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,432
How's Vishal's Mum?

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,006
I didn't talk to him after you told me not to...

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,875
Good.

30
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,175
I don't know what to tell you... It would've been better if your mother had come...

31
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:33,802
Of course but... She can't come right now...
-But this is important. We can't ignore it.

32
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:39,180
You can tell me. Dad and I used to help him with his work.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,009
Just me now...

34
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,590
Nadir's result has been very bad...

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,505
I'm sure you can understand... The tragedy we're living...

36
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:58,130
The school has tried everything. I have tried everything. I think it's something else...

37
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,385
What?

38
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:03,463
The school psychologist had a session with Nadir.

39
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:06,911
He has a learning disability.

40
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,007
Learning disability?

41
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,631
I don't get it...

42
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:28,560
That's why I wanted to talk to your mother. I'm sure she'd know...

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
You're too young to get this, maybe, but...

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,698
Nadir needs therapy for this...

45
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,033
30%... 40%... Can't believe it...

46
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,309
The teacher says he needs to work harder...

47
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,255
And?

48
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,978
Nothing?

49
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:23,323
Just... Talked about his exams... Results...

50
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,682
But he's never scored so low...

51
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:36,873
His grades are falling everyday... What's the matter?

52
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,886
Nadir's our only hope...

53
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,745
If he didn't study hard...

54
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,789
No... I'm sure you don't teach him well enough...

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,935
I'm getting him a tutor.

56
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,240
If you wanted to have something, yer could've jist asked me...

57
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,444
It's just noodles... Almost done...

58
00:05:21,444 --> 00:05:26,263
By the way... Aunt's been calling... What do I tell her?

59
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,473
What d'you mean?

60
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,262
How long do I have to ignore her?

61
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,873
As long as you can.

62
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,148
Hello

63
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,209
i

64
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:30,741
i know

65
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,257
i know you're

66
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,750
i know you're online...

67
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,223
why don't you say something ?

68
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,251
Because I want to forget you...

69
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,671
It's easy now...

70
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,200
But not for long...

71
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,420
Excuse me...

72
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,274
Good day.
-Good day.

73
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:20,995
D'you have a card?
-Of course.

74
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,160
Please wait with the martyrs' families.

75
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,070
They're all martyrs' families?

76
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,790
Yeah.

77
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,261
Looks like... This'll take a while...

78
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:38,499
Just wait for this patient... You're next.

79
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,379
But I go next.

80
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,021
They go first.

81
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,478
Please, come with me.

82
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:53,837
How many patients have we got?

83
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,038
Your messages last night

84
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:04,054
Your messages last night kinda caught

85
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:04,884
Your messages last night kinda caught me

86
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,767
Your messages last night kinda caught me .... by surprise

87
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,997
Vishal...

88
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,538
If you've got time, we can go the-morra.

89
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,512
Go where?

90
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:26,225
Your Grandpa's estate, of course...

91
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,943
That we've rented out.

92
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,740
Why?

93
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:33,694
Blimey...

94
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,532
We didn't get the rent last month.

95
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:43,297
Plus, Pratibha's gonna be 'ere anyday...

96
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:48,442
Oi don't nu waaat ter do... But aye...

97
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:56,536
She called yisser Mamai ter tell 'er we don't take 'er calls...

98
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:03,943
Just sell the estate... Or she'll keep bothering you...

99
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,268
You've got us.

100
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,745
Sometimes...

101
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:17,002
That's what I think too...

102
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,112
You can't hold on to everything forever...

103
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:26,441
Sometimes, you gotta decide...

104
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,340
When to hold on...

105
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,221
And when to let go...

106
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,870
So... Come with me tomorrow, okay?

107
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,251
Okay, Granny, as --

108
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,947
It's... Uhh...

109
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:50,741
One of my friends... I'll be back in a sec...

110
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,013
Hello?

111
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:57,039
You've got one for theatrics, I give you that!
-Theatrics?

112
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,696
'Caught me by surprise'? 'Not sure what to do'? D'you really think I'll buy any of that?

113
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:07,107
You're angry?
-Nah, I'm enjoying it thoroughly.

114
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,240
Obviously, I'm furious!

115
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,756
Too often, aye...

116
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:14,620
Don't you think?
-So?

117
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,558
How many times've you told me we're not talking again? Only to call me later yourself...

118
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,261
Mum was asking how your Mum's doing.

119
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,210
Like... My Mum? For real?

120
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:43,145
Aye... Told me not to talk to you... And then asked about your Mum...

121
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,770
That's very kind of her.

122
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:47,876
Weird is more like it.

123
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:48,713
Why?

124
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:55,034
I don't know what our elders want. Do they want to see each other or not, be friends or enemies, talk to each other or not...

125
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,496
I mean... They're so confused!

126
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:59,611
Well, so are we...!

127
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,889
I'm... So worried...

128
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,960
What is it?

129
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,613
Nadir's dyslexic... His teacher says he needs therapy.

130
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,664
Dyslexic?

131
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,601
Can't you know it early on?

132
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,804
How'd you miss it?

133
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:31,914
He was always a slow learner... With minor learning disabilities...

134
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:37,586
Dad used to help him with it... And then me... But he's changed...

135
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:43,351
I Googled around but I don't get much...

136
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:47,980
He's the man of the house... What if something happened to him?

137
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,449
Don't worry, Sarah...

138
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:56,496
If the teacher says he needs therapy, why d'you assume he's dyslexic?

139
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,730
I'm talking to you because -- I don't know what to do...

140
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,857
I'm so sorry...

141
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:07,900
If I knew you're so worried --
-You wouldn't have sugarcoated your ego as 'surprise'... Innit?

142
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,100
There's nothing left of my ego here...

143
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,502
I'm the only man looking after four women...

144
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:18,188
What'd happen to them if I started caring about my ego?

145
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:26,288
I'll -- Try something... Actually, you know what, Mum's taught SEND children for a while... Including dyslexics.

146
00:12:26,393 --> 00:12:29,020
She's a psychiatrist.

147
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,919
She's a psychiatrist?

148
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:34,076
A psychiatrist who can't handle her own depression?

149
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:37,300
It's always easy to solve others' problems...

150
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,790
But when it's your time... You know...

151
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,075
I have no idea what to do...

152
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,221
I'll talk to Mum...

153
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,280
What'll you tell her?

154
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,150
Everything. I've been talking to Col Sherali's daughter... And I want to help his son...

155
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,840
I mea --
-Who're you talking to again?

156
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,720
Col Sherali's daughter? Did I get that right?

157
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:10,325
Y -- Yeah... Mum...

158
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:14,390
You know everything...

159
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,384
I don't know what to say...

160
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,974
You're talking to Sarah Sherali?
-She's a soldier's daughter...

161
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:23,553
Someone like me...

162
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:28,300
The least two forces can do is answer a call for help...

163
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,414
It's called humanity.

164
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,916
'Humanity'...!

165
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,379
Don't ever preach your 'humanity' here again!

166
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,472
Get it?

167
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:48,275
What've I done to earn that slap?

168
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,090
You've got no idea, have you?

This here tastes lovely.

186
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,997
Got it?

187
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,261
Here. Like this.
-What's up with you?

188
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,442
Nothing?

189
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,815
What is it?

190
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,381
N -- Nothing...

191
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:15,547
I -- Don't exactly remember why I came here...

192
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:21,618
Someone needs to eat more almonds to keep their memory young!

193
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:25,765
Yeah, write that down too...
-And almonds...

194
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,913
Sarah...

195
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,085
What happened?

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,644
Nothing.

197
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:03,766
No, there's something... Tell me...

198
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,340
I talked to Vishal...

199
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,648
Hardly surprising, now, is it?

200
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,484
And then?

201
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:21,847
His Mum came when he was talking...

202
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,674
And...

203
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:29,705
She heard everything... She knows we talk to each other...

204
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,496
She slapped him...

205
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,470
I heard everything because I was on the phone.

206
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,060
Why are you so worried?

207
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,560
Why not?

208
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,406
We're enemies, Sarah.

209
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,700
What d'you care for them?

210
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,071
That's why I always said you shouldn't be talking to him...

211
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:56,032
Why does it hurt you if his Mum slapped him?

212
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,634
They hate us.

213
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:05,038
All of them.

214
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,414
Mum's got a point...

215
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,289
What's it to me?

216
00:17:22,603 --> 00:17:25,495
What do I care about Vishal?

217
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,533
Vishal...

218
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,618
C'mon. Dinner time.

219
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,392
Ain't you coming?

220
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:38,802
Not hungry.

221
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:40,040
What?

222
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,046
Not hungry.

223
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,981
You're not hungry?

224
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:48,248
Can't believe it...

225
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,319
Sunanda said the same thing...

226
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,743
Guess Oi'm de odd wan oyt...

227
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,588
Guess Oi'm... Too cowl...

228
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,408
Granny...

229
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,877
Granny!

230
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,482
What's up with you?

231
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,015
I'm having dinner...

232
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:36,526
Oi didn't ask if you're 'avin' bill skinner...

233
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:40,985
Oi'm askin' what's de matter witcha?

234
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:47,389
You just asked why I'm not having dinner... And when I am, you're asking what's the matter with me...

235
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:53,084
I'm just a bit worried about this... Test I've got...

236
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:59,840
I've never seen you worried about your exams before...

237
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:05,842
I've -- We've never lived through any of this before...

238
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,097
We've never had enemies in our lives before...

239
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,724
Who's yers?

240
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,900
Never mind... Let's enjoy our dinner...

241
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,100
Heard you haven't had dinner.

242
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:50,069
I've slapped you after years...

243
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,671
It killed something in me...

244
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:05,908
Make it a habit...

245
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:09,019
So it doesn't hurt either of us.

246
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,971
I thought...

247
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,531
You'd be upset...

248
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,860
Nah... You've always got the right to do that...

249
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,956
How could I be upset?

250
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,950
Okay...

251
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,110
Just don't talk to Sarah Sherali again, okay?

252
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,010
You know...

253
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:38,137
Her Dad is responsible for everything we're going through.

254
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,005
And my Dad's responsible for everything she's going through...

255
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,237
Can't believe you're saying that.

256
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,477
They're going through a lot.

257
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,376
You've got me.

258
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:08,839
They've just got a girl of 19. She's got to take care of everything.

259
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,730
Why d'you feel so much for her?

260
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,404
What do we care what she's going through?

261
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,760
Back when you were depressed... I talked to her. She said I should talk to your friend.

262
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,310
Her Mum doesn't want her talking to 'that Indian lad' either.

263
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,850
Why are you telling me? And why'd you tell her anything that should've stayed between the two of us?

264
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:44,101
Jaysus, Mum -- I dunno why I told her... It just...

265
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:47,223
Felt like...

266
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:53,560
She's the only one who can understand my pain... Because she's going through the same...

267
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,879
She told me her Mum's been asking about you.

268
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,085
Never forget we're enemies!

269
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:06,095
No way I can forget that... Not with you saying it every waking moment to remind me!

270
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:10,700
We don't talk about our friends as much as we talk about one enemy.

271
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,929
They're not living through the same upheavals as us... Not even remotely...

272
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,394
We lost everything. You know everything.

273
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,797
They're responsible for everything!

274
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:28,763
I mean -- Just look at your Aunt...

275
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,029
Mum...

276
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,042
They've got nothing but problems...

277
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,990
Her seven-year-old brother's dyslexic.

278
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,864
His teacher just told her. She hasn't told her Mum yet.

279
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,739
She's got her Granny... Grandpa... And others in the family who only care about their shares...

280
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,954
Her Mum's been a housewife all this time.

281
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,050
Totally dependent.

282
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:14,298
She doesn't have a clue either.

283
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,908
We're hardly any better off...

284
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,513
It hurts them the same as us.

285
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:29,330
The same as I miss Dad or you miss your husband...

286
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:35,870
If your Granny found out... She won't spare you...

287
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,893
You know how the thinks... If she could nearly ostracise me for my low birth...
-Aye...

288
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:44,737
If she found out you're making friends with her son's killers...

289
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:47,745
You're right, Mum...

290
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:50,247
I'll talk to her myself...

291
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,524
Just...

292
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:56,263
Don't get all worked-up over it, okay?

293
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:58,512
But you won't budge?

294
00:23:58,512 --> 00:24:01,637
No, Mum... Gimme a sec...

295
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,871
She helped me once...

296
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:09,350
I want to too... Get even?

297
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,913
I don't want any favours...

298
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:16,373
After that... I promise I won't talk to her again...

299
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,454
Hello?

300
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,550
Is everything okay ??

301
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,881
Yeah, why? What happened

302
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,320
Can I call you on Skype?

303
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,610
Can I call you on skype????

304
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:47,444
Yeah offcource

305
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:52,022
What's your skype ID ?

306
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,327
Hello?

307
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,214
Hello. Can you hear me?

308
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,073
Yeah. Can you?

309
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:57,141
Aye... But I can't see you...

310
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,632
Perfect. I ain't video calling.

311
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,568
What's the point of using Skype if you're not video calling?

312
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:15,332
Facebook Messenger garbled your voice too often. So, plan B: Skype!

313
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,221
You've seen me, I've seen you... Hardly any point in video chatting now, is there?

314
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:22,763
Aye...

315
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,730
You've seen me, I've seen you... Hardly any point in video chatting...

316
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,895
Your Mum must be angry... Because of this...

317
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,988
She slapped you?

318
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,927
How d'you know?

319
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:48,200
You forgot to hang up.

320
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,925
I -- Heard everything...

321
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,637
Everything?

322
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,154
Everything.

323
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,771
She hates us, doesn't she?

324
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,839
Just like your Mum hates us, aye...

325
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,330
Not like it's unfair...

326
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,183
Is it?

327
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:17,798
No.

328
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,672
It's only fair...

329
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,582
But why were you standing by me?

330
00:27:23,582 --> 00:27:26,003
Siding with me?

331
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:30,055
You could've saved yourself the misery...

332
00:27:30,478 --> 00:27:35,045
If I knew you were listening, I wouldn't have said any of that.

333
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,114
You're a good man, Vishal...

334
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,986
Not really as bad as on the telly.

335
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:49,176
You're not as bad as I thought either.

336
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:54,810
Your Mum doesn't want you talking to me, yes? Just like my Mum...

337
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,430
Not exactly...

338
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:01,180
I mean, yeah, she did try... But I didn't give in...

339
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,998
I ain't as cowardly as you.

340
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,812
I'm a lot of things, but cowardly is not one of them.

341
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,543
I'm a fallen hero's daughter.

342
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,120
Easy there... It's the same here...

343
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:23,846
Anyway... Before I forget it... What've you thought about Nadir?

344
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:27,090
Nothing. No idea what to do.

345
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,400
How do I tell Mum? She's so worried... She'd panic if she heard it!

346
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,357
I just spent another day Googling around...

347
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:44,040
I'll try to connect you to someone who can help...

348
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,620
Who knows, Mum may talk to you in person.

349
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:51,583
Your Mum? She'd never...

350
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:55,920
No way... I can't talk to her...

351
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,645
How can I talk to her? What do I say to her?

352
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:01,786
The same as she'd talk to you?

353
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:05,470
No -- Don't -- I'll manage something...

354
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,122
I'll talk to Nadir's teacher... She can help.

355
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:15,100
Don't you want my help? And -- Mum's not as bad as you think...

356
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,934
She's a very...

357
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:20,545
Kind woman... Very kind and polite...

358
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm sure she's just like that...

359
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,729
Very kind... Caring... For everyone around you.

360
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:36,234
But we're Pakistanis. Soldiers. Colonel Sherali's family, no less.

361
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,995
We ain't so lucky.

362
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,524
So...

363
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:44,394
What d'you think about me?

364
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,757
I'm an Indian too...

365
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:50,255
Colonel Vijay Malhotra's son...

366
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,127
I'm very kind to you... And I want to help you out...

367
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,418
Who are you to me?

368
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,602
Can you tell me?

369
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,191
Someone who shares your grief.

370
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,110
Because it's as much his own...

371
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,084
That you, Amna?

372
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,048
You gave us a fright!
-Yeah, it's me.

373
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:11,600
What happened?

374
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,581
I thought someone's trying to pry open the door from outside. Thought I'd check...

375
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:20,960
I check the doors when Nawab's not around...

376
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,980
I locked the main door myself.

377
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,320
I lock all the doors and windows myself ever since Nawab left.

378
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,158
It's the least I can do.

379
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:37,624
Don't worry. Get some rest.

380
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:44,912
Sofia and I are used to it... We can't get a moment's sleep...

381
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,784
We can check the doors all we want.

382
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,978
I can't get a moment's sleep either...

383
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,143
No idea what's wrong...

384
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,628
You know how I used to sleep without a care in the world...

385
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:10,579
You'd get furious over it too...

386
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:13,013
But now...

387
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,034
Nothing ages a woman more than being widowed...

388
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,923
Mum!

389
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:42,596
Ready?

390
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,440
Just a minute...

391
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,190
Gimme a moment to do my hair...

392
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,869
What're you looking at?

393
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,823
Nothing...

394
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:58,640
Just... Seeing you so lively and fresh after ages... I love it...

395
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,390
I'm sure there's a ton of work waiting for me...

396
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,248
All those patients...

397
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,550
You can leave if you're getting late... Another day maybe?

398
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:20,369
No. It's your first day back at work... No way I'm not dropping you. Not today.

399
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,223
Okay?

400
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,752
Aye, c'mon.

401
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,970
And...
-Hmm?

402
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,183
Don't forget the dyslexia case you told me about...

403
00:33:34,183 --> 00:33:38,762
Get all the details. I'll see what I can do.

404
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,182
Whoa, Mum...
-I know a few useful websites...

405
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:46,091
I know a few useful websites...

406
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:51,198
But the kid needs counselling. That's what matters more.

407
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:58,830
You want to talk to Sarah or her Mum yourself?
-I don't think I need to... You can tell them everything yourself.

408
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,090
Granny...

409
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,922
Mum's going back to work... Lovely, innit?

410
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,395
Don't you think you should change?

411
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,262
What?
-You're a widow.

412
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,868
It's barely been a month.

413
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,840
What with these fancy clothes --

414
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,345
What with these fancy clothes --
-No, seriously, Granny -- I'm sure Mum --

415
00:34:24,345 --> 00:34:26,189
No, seriously, Granny -- I'm sure Mum --

416
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,628
No, seriously, Granny -- I'm sure Mum --
-No...

417
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:28,656
No...

418
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,152
She's right...

419
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,570
How'd I forget?

420
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,830
Just -- How?

421
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,674
I'm a widow...

422
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,786
These...

423
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:47,467
Colours... Don't suit me anymore...

424
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,303
Just a second... I'll go change...

425
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,350
Wait here, okay?

426

Your Mum's young... Beautiful...

429
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:16,769
Out there, they're gonna say all sorts of things, and none of us... <i>None</i> of us can shut them or our ears up!

430
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,710
So, which one d'you like?

431
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,480
You must be the only soldier's wife who doesn't care about the time one bit!

432
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,080
So hurry up and tell me! I need to go change!

433
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,370
Anything but black and white, hun... You don't need to ask.

434
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,270
As if you ever let me buy anything black and white...

435
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,504
Oh, I never will...

436
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:32,860
By the way, I don't know what's taking you so long...

I mean, mate...

438
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:39,567
Can you see something better than this?
-Oh, not again!

439
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:47,780
And again, and again! Because this looks lovely on you!
-My cupboard's full of colours... Can't you pick another, like, ever?

440
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,430
No way, ma'am...

441
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,691
Because these reds...

00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:57,120
Stoke the flames of love...!

00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:41,876
Mum needed plain white dresses...

Sorry...

I thought maybe because you're educated... You wouldn't care about these... Things...

00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:15,460
No.

484
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,280
We don't have to wear white...

485
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,405
Anything plain. That's all.

486
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:26,148
Isn't that what they show in your plays? Everyone wears white in mourning.

487
00:40:26,148 --> 00:40:36,430
Yeah, thanks to you lot. Our directors started making 'em all wear white because everyone in <i>your</i> films and dramas wears white in mourning... For the rest of us... It's catching on...

488
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,990
Your Mum's lucky...

489
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:41,737
There's colours in her life...

490
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:44,241
Not in mine's...

491
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,824
Break free.

492
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,810
Big deal! Let her wear colours if that's what she wants.

493
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,469
That's <i>all</i> she likes...

494
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,739
Red...

495
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:01,958
Maroon...

496
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,989
And shocking pink!

497
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,750
But never white...
-Mum gave everything colourful she had to the maid...

498
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,229
Why?

499
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:17,346
You just said she can wear them...

500
00:41:17,346 --> 00:41:20,700
She can, but...

501
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,696
I don't know...

502
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,065
First time the very thought of conflict has repulsed me...

503
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,240
Is it?

504
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:40,729
Mine was when I saw Dad's coffin...

505
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,970
Getting killed in action...

506
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:49,870
I always thought that's a glory... A privilege... But now, I realise...

507
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:52,740
It comes at a great price...

508
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:58,640
If I could give everything I had to get Dad back...

509
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,796
I wouldn't think for a moment.

510
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,690
Glory... Heroism...

511
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,347
Everything...

512
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,045
Me too...

513
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:15,100
He was deployed in our city just once... Before he was sent to the frontline...

514
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,696
Dad and Mum were always in different cities...

515
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,010
Life couldn't be more unpredictable.

516
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,970
I've started writing everything I can remember about Dad in my diary...

517
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,108
You keep a diary?
-Mhm...

518
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,493
Me too.

519
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,068
Really?

520
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,980
We've got a lot in common...

521
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,570
Besides our grief, I mean...

522
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:50,070
Well then, doesn't that make it easier to be friends?

523
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,431
Or enemies...

524
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:55,553
Just look at our nations...

525
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,030
Anyway, I'll get back to you tomorrow, Vishal...

526
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,113
Gotta study...

527
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,024
If you need any help...

528
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,549
You know you've got me.

529
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,000
I need to learn to do these things myself...

530
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
