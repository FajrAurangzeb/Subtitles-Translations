Episode 2 - 'Dust and Echoes'

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,951
I never knew this side of you... The brave son...

22
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,892
It's nothing...

23
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:40,030
I was reading your row on Facebook with Sarah Sherali all night.

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,838
You cut her down to size! She couldn't say a word! I dare imagine how it was between her Dad and yours...

25
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,680
Vishal...

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,008
We're all very proud of you... You've shown the world you're ready to pick up the baton.

27
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,040
Well done, m'lad.

28
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,648
Who is it this time?

29
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:16,048
They want to interview Miss Sarah.

30
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,490
Sarah?

31
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,880
But why?

32
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,030
Well...

33
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,143
She had a row with Col Vijay Malhotra's son on Facebook...

34
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,970
I hear you had a row...

35
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,906
With someone on Facebook?

36
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,636
What happened?

37
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:58,416
A bunch of reporters are here... They say they're covering the row between you and the son of... Col Vijay Malhotra, yes...

38
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,327
They want to talk to you.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:12,330
I'd like to thank the people of Pakistan for supporting me on social media...

40
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:20,170
And standing by me after the... Threats and all... And liking my comments...

41
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,778
We'd all like to know... How'd it start?

42
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:34,880
Well... I saw this video on Facebook about the Indian Government decorating Col Vijay Malhotra...

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:43,420
For 'routing the enemy'... That'd be my father... Who, as you know... Stopped the enemy in their tracks!

44
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,240
Why does she have to say any of this to the media? I don't like it one bit!

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,038
Agreed. I'll talk to her Grandpa...

46
00:03:53,038 --> 00:03:56,490
Would you like to tell us how you feel?
-No idea why she's got to be all soppy!

47
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,759
No idea why she's got to be all soppy!
-We don't know a greater hero than Dad. I'm very proud of him. We all are.

48
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:04,549
We don't know a greater hero than Dad. I'm very proud of him. We all are.

49
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,240
And -- We're not grieving or something...

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:21,780
The entire nation's watching you, Vishal. I'm sure you're proud of how we've all stood by you as you showed our enemy's girl her place on that thread!

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,560
The nation salutes your father's courage.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,065
To see the entire nation rally behind me... It was almost overwhelming... But it gave me strength...

53
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:51,920
It gave us all strength that my countrymen stood by us and paid their tributes to my father... I don't think I could've faced all the abuses thrown my way without their support.

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,530
Of course. But is there anything you'd like Sarah Sherali to hear?

55
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,369
No.

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:10,610
Because my Dad said everything we've got to say to Sarah Sherali's Dad.

57
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,120
We're ready to sever the heads of those who dare look at us the wrong way.

58
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:28,225
My family stands as one, united... Proud that the nation salutes my father's sacrifice.

59
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:37,955
We end this programme on that note. We'll be back with another debate after the break. Hail India!

60
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,261
They pay him anything for it?

61
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,749
Why?

62
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:53,589
Why not?

63
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:59,019
Everyone gets paid to be interviewed on these shows.

64
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:00,859
Except him, I guess?

65
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:05,129
Well... The mother of one of his friends works for the channel...

66
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,030
Oh, hell...

67
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,389
Exploitation... All over the blasted place!

68
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:19,780
Here's a tip... Before any of you goes for the next interview... Just... Sort out your deal, okay?

69
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,460
I can sort out everything else.

70
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,140
I know these dratted journalists inside out...

71
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,979
I know just what goes on behind the scenes...

72
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:49,070
That was bang-on brilliant, sir! With a bit of skillful presentation (I'll take care of that!), your granddaughter's high-octane interview will flummox India proper!

73
00:06:49,070 --> 00:07:02,660
Now... It's up to you to make 'em all cry... Put on 'We'll Meet Again' or 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' in the background... Anything. I want to see tears, and I want to see a lot of them!

74
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,879
It'd be all the better if...

75
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,270
We could talk to the Colonel's younger daughter and son.

76
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,350
Gotta say, you're quite the orator! You cut the Paki down to size!

77
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,529
Just lovely!

78
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:30,890
Yeah! I could almost hear the Pakis scream throughout the programme!

79
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,510
We've got so many messages...!
-Wonderful...

80
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm thinking of inviting you again... But you gotta give me your word you're not gonna talk to any other channel... Keep this exclusive, okay, Vishal?

81
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
Very important!

82
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:57,060
Okay? And, Arun... I think you should work on his contract... Sign him up for a few features and programmes...

83
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,980
Work on his Facebook and Instagram pages...

84
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,430
And you've got to find every pic with your Dad that you can...

85
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:18,120
Send them to us, and we're gonna share them. Try to find the most sentimental ones... The ones that make you cry, okay? Okay...

86
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,210
Well done.

87
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,010
Thank you.
-Yeah...

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,090
Where's Daddie?
-Martyred...

89
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,780
Martyred?
-In a war...

90
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,220
Fighting who?

91
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,440
No one...

92
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,630
Cut! Not right...

93
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:53,130
Let's start again. When I ask you that one, you got to say... 'Indians'!

94
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,100
Who?
-Indians...

95
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,070
Actually... Better yet, say... 'The Indian Colonel'. Again, who?

96
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,199
The Indian Colonel...
-Lovely.

97
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,170
Alright, we're ready.

98
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,750
I'm gonna start with that question, and you're gonna say...?

99
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,890
'The Indian Colonel'.
-Aye.

100
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,970
Next, I'm gonna ask what he used to kill him, and you're gonna say, 'His gun', okay?

101
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,000
'His gun'...
-Again?

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,539
Again?
-'His gun'.

103
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,810
Okay. Ready?

104
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,870
Okay.

105
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,810
Fighting who?

106
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,670
The Indian Colonel...

107
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:40,410
Your Dad killed the Pakistani Colonel. What's he gonna get for it?
-A medal.
-A medal.

108
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,579
Here we have Pari and Laxmi... Young, but not too young to appreciate their father's courage that earned him the Victoria Cross.

109
00:09:47,579 --> 00:10:00,690
They know he's not coming back, but they know he's done something that makes their family and their nation proud.

110
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,690
This was Noran Bhaskar reporting from Col Vijay Malhotra's place... Keep watching AS News.

111
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,140
Cut!

112
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,049
So... How was it?

113
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:14,300
C'mon, pack everything. We gotta go.

114
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,129
Tell the crew we're leaving.

115
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,790
Excuse me...

116
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,020
Who's the producer?

117
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,070
Yours truly.

118
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,824
Okay...

119
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,960
Anurag. Vijay Malhotra's brother-in-law.

120
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,670
Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

121
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,980
So... How're y'alls payin' us?

122
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,110
Paying? For what?

123
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:51,890
Laxmi and Pari's interview, of course? And Mum's. Don't tell me you're not...

124
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:58,449
We're just covering this story... For all of India and the world to watch...

125
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,170
Aye, so?

126
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,511
You're getting your views, aren't you?

127
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:09,621
I'm from Canada, and they pay 'em for these kinds of shows there.

128
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,379
You're in India, sir... That's not how it is here.

129
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:22,980
Well, then, why don't you start a tradition here? Such a popular channel... Helping a family in need...

130
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,070
Besides...

131
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:32,460
We've talked to dozens of channels by now. I think it's about time y'alls valued our time.

132
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,760
Don't you think martyrs' families shouldn't be saying that?

133
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,940
Vijay martyred himself.

134
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,950
We've got our lives...

135
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,130
Needs...

136
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,260
I think y'alls should work on these things before you interview any of us. That's how it is everywhere.

137
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,130
This is not fair.

138
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,650
Careful! The trophy's fragile!

139
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah, we're careful...

140
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,370
Ridiculous!

141
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:05,240
Why'd you have to create a scene?

142
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,000
Why'd he have to say his Dad was a hero? We all know Dad was the real hero.

143
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,070
Let him believe what he wants to! The world knows better. You don't need to prove your Dad's heroism with this vaudeville!

144
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,720
I can't take it...
-Your Dad's no more...

145
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,390
And you've started disobeying me ever since! I can't take it anymore!

146
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,328
Who told you to sign the contract?

147
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:42,970
She just wanted me to agree to talk only to their channel. I didn't think it was a big deal...
-Please, Vishal, we don't want to sell our grief! We don't want any ratings!

148
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,310
Just call and tell them you're not creating this Facebook page...

149
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,480
But Mum --
-No!

150
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,600
Or running this Instagram campaign!

151
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,849
Yeah, we do nothing while that Paki Colonel's girl can do whatever the devil she wants!
-Yeah. Nothing.

152
00:12:57,849 --> 00:13:02,850
Because this isn't a war you can't get out of, Vishal.

153
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,018
Enough...

154
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:08,060
You're not talking to the press ever again.

155
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,988
What's the big deal, Mum?

156
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,401
Dad gave his life for this nation!

157
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:20,492
It's the least we could do to honour his legacy... His sacrifice!

158
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,090
As if screaming your guts out on Facebook and Instagram could help!

159
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:56,490
'Not sorry, Indians, but Col Vijay Malhotra was no brave man.'
-'My father embraced death, fighting the good fight. What can you Indian wretches do except yap online?'
-'Miss Sarah Sherali... Your manners show the character of your country. Cowards! That's what you are. What you've always been. I'm Vishal Malhotra... The son of Col Vijay Malhotra... Who died fighting to protect his country... But not before proving his mettle and crushing your army... For which, in just a few days, he will be awarded the Victoria Cross. You are most welcome to believe it. Or would you rather want an official invitation?'

160
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:15,950
'Miss Sarah Sherali... Your manners show the character of your country. Cowards! That's what you are. What you've always been. I'm Vishal Malhotra... The son of Col Vijay Malhotra...

You are most welcome to believe it. Or would you rather want an official invitation?'
-'Mr Vishal Mahotra... Admittedly, I feel sorry for your loss... But it appears you've lost your sanity between your grief, which is why you can do no better than shoot your mouth off here!'
-'No amount of chest-thumping or gibbering here's gonna prove how brave you are.'

161
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,770
'I'd like to see you bring your old man's regiment here so we can sort it out in a fair fight!'

162
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:37,310
'Oh, please, just admit we've given you the frights... It's a lot easier... Your old man died a coward's death!'
-'That's only because we're ready to fight... And die for our nation. Were it up to you, you would've killed all the minorities in yours!'

163
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:35,508
Doesn't he look like your Dad?

164
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,038
As elegant and handsome as Dad...

165
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,590
When your Dad passed away...

166
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,420
He told me...

167
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,478
'Never grieve that I'm gone'...

168
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:04,330
'For Vijay will always be there with you'...

169
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,310
But Vijay... Didn't even get a chance to say...

170
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,811
Mum...

171
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,417
The more you look at this, the more you'll miss him...

172
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:26,787
And the more you miss him, the more you'll cry...

173
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,120
Just think...

174
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,940
That he's a hero...

175
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,944
Heroes never die --
-They do!

176
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,550
Who told you they don't?

177
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,380
Ask one's mother...

178
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,300
And she'll correct you...

179
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,790
There, now, Mum...

180
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,549
Get up...

181
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,347
Come.

182
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,890
Have you booked your ticket?

183
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,298
Yeah. I leave on the 20th.

184
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,059
But I'll be back in two months.

185
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,348
Mum...

186
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,920
There's something I wanted to ask...

187
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,330
Yeah?

188
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,077
Go on.

189
00:17:47,400 --> 00:18:00,129
Anurag said... If we could get a part of the estate... We could get a better place in Canada.

190
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,497
The estate?

191
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,550
I've rented it out.

192
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,110
You also get Dad's pension.

193
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,000
Waaat aboyt Vijay's kids?
-He's a martyr, Mum...

194
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,907
They're entitled to welfare.

195
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:32,917
Anurag said they can get housing too.

196
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,368
We didn't talk about it earlier because you used to live there...

197
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,319
But you'd be living with Sunanda now...
-No...!

198
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,540
I want to live at my place.

199
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,068
You should be with Sunanda and Vishal.

200
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:59,288
Surely you'd rather not live all alone at this age?

201
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:03,990
Besides... As I've told you...

202
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,778
We'd need it...

203
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,490
Anyway, think over it...

204
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,790
No hurries...

205
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,368
We can talk again when I'm back.

206
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:24,089
Anurag's brother can help you out.

207
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,869
He'll get you a good price for it.

208
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:32,169
Get some rest. You need it.

209
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,670
Good night.

210
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,417
Amna...

211
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,528
What d'you think?

212
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,438
About what?

213
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,788
Your life...

214
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,960
Nothing...

215
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,868
The kids... Mum and Dad...

216
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,690
How can I look after everyone?

217
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,140
That's why I'm asking you to think about it.

218
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,440
I've talked to Nazia...

219
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,881
And we think it's best...

220
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:25,097
That you come over to our place in Karachi.

221
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,057
Me?

222
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,938
Yeah.

223
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,538
You and the kids.

224
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:46,927
As for your parents, their daughters can take them to London or the US.

225
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:54,147
How'd you, Sarah, and the kids live here all alone?

226
00:21:54,618 --> 00:22:00,089
We don't know anyone around here.

227
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:07,199
That's why I thought you should come over...

228
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:19,148
We can rent the place the army gives you out...

229
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:24,919
Together with your pension, it should take care of everything.

230
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,800
I can't think of anything.

231
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,030
Well, when you can... Think over it.

232
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:37,860
Give yourself some time...

233
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,140
But in a few months... You've got to.

234
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,810
I mean...

235
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,970
Sarah's coming of age too...

236
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,418
It's best that you have a man in the family.

237
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:56,946
Your father's ageing, and Nadir's just a boy.

238
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:04,017
You know what I mean, don't you?

239
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,480
I get it, but Mum won't let me.
-What d'you mean?

240
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,447
You've signed a contract with us!
-Yeah... But I didn't ask Mum about it...

241
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:30,417
She says I shouldn't have signed it.
-I'm coming over in the evening.

242
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,674
We'll sort it out.

243
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:36,580
You're making your Dad proud.

244
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,047
D'you understand you're fighting for a good cause?

245
00:23:40,047 --> 00:23:45,220
His sacrifice and your patriotism inspire the youth.

246
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,741
Fine by me. But Mum...

247
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:54,680
If it's fine by you, I'm coming over in the evening to convince your Mum.

248
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,958
Okay.
-Bye.

249
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,538
Bye.

250
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,846
Mum...

251
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:07,087
We're not going anywhere.

252
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,427
Who told you we're going anywhere?

253
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:14,892
I heard you and Uncle.

254
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,878
It just won't be home...

255
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,940
Yeah...

256
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:30,710
But we can't stay here, Sarah...
-Why not?

257
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:37,111
They all support us here... The TV, the media, the neighbours, the unit...

258
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:40,352
We don't need Uncle's help.

259
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,450
This won't go on for much longer...

260
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,040
They'll all get back to their lives...

261
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,054
And forget us...

262
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,854
No way.

263
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,318
Dad gave his life for us all. We're his family.

264
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:05,438
How can they forget a martyr? And us?

265
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,730
A third-world martyr...

266
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,428
What does it matter?

267
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,689
It does.

268
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:19,939
I can't tell you everything...

269
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:23,860
But you'll find out soon enough...

270
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,970
Whatever...

271
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,338
I can't leave my home.

272
00:25:29,338 --> 00:25:32,089
I want to stay here.

273
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,207
I know how you feel, Sunanda...

274
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:45,947
But the best thing is that you've still got Vishal.

275
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:52,760
You've got someone to keep Vijay's memory alive.

276
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,970
I don't think there's anything more powerful than social media these days.

277
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,818
That's why I asked Vishal to --
-Vishal... Go...

278
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,278
Ankita...

279
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,969
I don't want Vishal to waste his time on social media.

280
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:24,620
He's under a lot of pressure.
-Of course, I understand it.

281
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,180
I don't want him to waste a second either.

282
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:34,770
But I've got a team of managers... For his pages and content. His response to Sarah.

283
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,530
Let's just end it here. Please.

284
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:44,210
I don't want Vishal to fight a war on social media everyday... Not least the war that claimed his father's life.

285
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:51,440
It may be a job for you, but it's not for Vishal. He's still studying!

286
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,627
I want him to stay away from this mess!

287
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:57,478
I talked to Anurag.

288
00:26:57,478 --> 00:27:01,705
And he was so excited about the prospects!

289
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:06,820
And he said h --
-My son's not gonna make a fortune out of his Dad's death.

290
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,480
So I'm sorry... Please go and make it clear to Anurag too.

291
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,628
What happened?

292
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,928
I was worried where Sarah may be...

293
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:39,690
But turns out she's right here!

294
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,448
Amna!

295
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,946
Sarah's here with us!

296
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,758
Come here.

297
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,203
C'mon, now...

298
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:03,980
Yeah?

299
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:06,188
What is it?

300
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:09,248
Won't you tell Granny?

301
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,820
I don't want to go to Uncle's.

302
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,417
Who's sending you there?
-Uncle was talking to Mum about it.

303
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:28,380
He says we should live with him in Karachi... And you should live with Aunt in the US... Or England.

304
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,450
Granny...

305
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,640
I don't want to go there...

306
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,649
I hate his kids!

307
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:38,689
Please tell him...

308
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:42,730
I don't want to go there...

309
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,968
No way I'm going there...

310
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,138
I'll ask Vishal to drop you at the airport.
-He said it himself.

311
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,660
Take care.

312
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,938
And take care of Mum.

313
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:14,070
She's just got you and Vishal...

314
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:17,960
C'mon... I'll see Anurag off too.

315
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,590
I'll be back in two months...

316
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,380
Got a few things to sort out.

317
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,960
Bye.

318
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,908
Take care.

319
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,600
Sunanda...

320
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:37,970
Anurag wants me to sell my estate...

321
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,230
And give him his share.

322
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,638
Your estate?

323
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,511
My estate... My home...

324
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,959
What d'you say?

325
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,748
Whatever suits you.

326
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:19,932
Don't talk to the journalists before striking a deal with them, okay?

327
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,989
Okay.

328
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:30,391
You don't know it, but we've seen the world. We know how they make money.

329
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:36,450
Feel free to get back to us if you need anything. I can talk to them for you.

330
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,958
Okay.

331
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,531
Vishal...

332
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,361
What are your plans after A-Levels?

333
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,640
I haven't really thought about it... But maybe computer engineering?

334
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:58,440
Aye, good. You can come over to Canada. Study at a good university. With your excellent grades, it should be a doddle.

335
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:08,930
Why? I mean -- He doesn't really have to come all the way and all... You've got many good options here...

336
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:17,010
Besides, your family need you. Mum, Granny, Pari and Laxmi...

337
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,910
You're responsible for all of them.

338
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,890
You're the man in the house.

339
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:27,800
'Bout time you got over your friends and all, by the way.

340
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,419
Aye.

341
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,310
Amna...

342
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,020
Yeah?

343
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,060
We...

344
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,758
Need to talk...

345
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,290
Alright?

346
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,240
Yeah.

347
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,300
Just the usual...

348
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:14,735
We can only live as long as we're destined to...

349
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,760
Anyway...

350
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,260
I heard you're going over to Badar's with the kids?

351
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,108
Who told you?

352
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,530
Sarah.

353
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,380
Well...

354
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:50,649
He said the kids are young... And Sarah's coming of age, so...

355
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,620
Sarah's Grandpa said...

356
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,410
He'd do his best...

357
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,409
To do his duty as the man in the house.

358
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:21,250
It's nothing like that, Mum... He's done so much for us, but...

359
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,530
My dear...

360
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,890
At this age...

361
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:37,500
We can't think of going to England...

362
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,680
The US, or anywhere...

363
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,930
Because...

364
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:50,480
We want to be around Sherali's kids...

365
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,540
As, I'm sure, they'd want us around...

366
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000

367
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,460
Hello? Sarah? You there?

368
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,840
Yes...

369
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,140
What is it?

370
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,871
Just missing Dad...

371
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:21,310
The misery, the problems... We are the same...

372
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,950
You think I'm yampy?
-No... Just... Depressed.

373
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:31,310
But why are we talking about it? Why am I telling you any of it? We're enemies, aren't we?

374
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,370
So we are.
