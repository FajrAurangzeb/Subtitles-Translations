Episode 5 - 'Hostile Sorrows'

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,739
Vishal...

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,828
Hi, Aunt Shefali...

23
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,954
Bless you.

24
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,068
Everything alright?

25
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:47,581
Well...

26
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,930
Sorta yes. Sorta no...

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,234
And Sunanda?

28
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:56,039
We need to talk...

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,760
Mum's on these antidepressants...

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:16,170
She takes sleeping pills and sleeps all day...

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,847
Everything's upside down over here... I have no idea what I can do...

32
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,350
She takes all of these?
-Aye.

33
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,648
Can't believe it...

34
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,848
She won't listen to anyone else...

35
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:40,309
So I thought if -- You know -- You could...

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,725
Don't worry.

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,468
I'll talk to her.

38
00:02:49,311 --> 00:02:56,083
In fact, I feel guilty because I met her the other day... And I couldn't get a hint...

39
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,518
Don't worry.

40
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:01,598
I'll take care of it.

41
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,489
I'll talk to her.

42
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay...

43
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:23,400
What d'you mean your sister-in-law wants your daughter's hand in marriage for her son?

44
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,938
Yes...

45
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,290
She talked about it...

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,299
Said he'd be a good match...

47
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:31,230
An American national...

48
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,878
Currently in University...

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,708
I was thinking of Hammad.

50
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:44,738
But it seems you'd rather do as your in-laws say.

51
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,811
Hammad?
-Aye. Hammad.

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,121
My wife and I talked about it.

53
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:57,732
We think it's best that Sarah marry Hammad.

54
00:03:57,732 --> 00:04:01,122
She can get married in time...

55
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:04,808
And we can free you of one responsibility...

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,248
But...

57
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:12,291
Hammad's not settled into his life...

58
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,450
He's not a very good student either...

59
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,766
As if her son got into Harvard.

60
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,430
Hammad's in University too. He's into Media Studies.

61
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,230
And I've got my business...

62
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,890
He's always got a second option.

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,090
I don't know what to say...
-You need to look your in-laws in the eye and make it clear...

64
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,660
But don't worry... I'll talk to them now...

65
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,481
Your sisters-in-law and Sherali's parents...

66
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,970
They can't pressure you like this!

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,611
Not after Sherali passed away!

68
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,539
I don't get why your sisters-in-law are even here...

69
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,470
What do they want?

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,180
No one bothered to be here for Sherali's funeral.

71
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,691
What right do they have after all this time to come here camping and propose Sarah's marriage?

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,339
Anurag and Pratibha called last night...

73
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,760
Why?

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,181
Oh, I don't know.

75
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:56,261
Maybe because you're being tyrannised here!

76
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:01,681
Why wouldn't she call me? After everything you've told her...

77
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,748
No, Sunanda... Oi didn't say anythin'!

78
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:12,278
We can go on for hours about it... But... This isn't okay!

79
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,398
That's all...

80
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,078
Just --

81
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,569
Just -- Go back to your place...

82
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,498
My place?

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,420
Oi 'av naw place oi can call 'um...

84
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,969
Except 'ere, wi' Vishal, Pari, an' Laxmi...

85
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,583
Look... I don't want your daughter calling me again...

86
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:47,600
Whining about how I'm using Vishal to blackmail you emotionally...

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,281
So I can --

88
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,212
Usurp your estate...

89
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:01,890
I hate it when someone reminds me of my background, my status... Including you!

90
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,954
I had no option but to hear everything you'd mouth...

91
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:10,969
But not now...

92
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,368
Enough...

93
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,860
It's best...

94
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,796
That you leave...

95
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:21,488
For my sake, for my kids' sake...

96
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:25,298
And for the sake of our peace...

97
00:07:25,298 --> 00:07:27,830
And yours!

98
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm not stopping you from seeing the kids...

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,998
Come here anytime you want...

100
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:40,788
But -- We want nothing to do with your estate...

101
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,828
C'mon... Sit...

102
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,080
Granny's not going anywhere, Mum.

103
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:03,280
Can't believe you'd still side with her... After everything your Aunt said last night?

104
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,581
What about everything she said about me?

105
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:10,550
She's at the other end of the world in Canada...

106
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,580
What's it matter to us what they say?

107
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,092
Your Granny tells her every single detail!

108
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:24,970
If we're such a bother, why doesn't she leave for somewhere she'd be happy?

109
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:34,446
And her sweet girl thinks you're so close to your Granny because you want to usurp her estate!

110
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,251
You're proving her right...

111
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,905
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,955
That's not like you...

113
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:49,126
That's not how you think...

114
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:52,987
My Mum would never think like that!

115
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,618
It's okay...

116
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:25,949
No one can kick you out...

117
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:29,048
As long as I'm here...

118
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,517
She wants the estate?

119
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,380
She can have it.

120
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,918
Okay?

121
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,818
Mum...

122
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,829
Granny's getting old...

123
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,684
Where'd she go?

124
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,862
You know Dad couldn't live without her...

125
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,936
You've always held him - and her - in the highest regard...

126
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:15,747
That's what you've taught me.

127
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:20,838
Please, Vishal... I don't want to talk about it. Leave.

128
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:23,968
All I want to say --
-Please!

129
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:28,049
Just -- Go... Or I'm going...

130
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,128
So, what is it?
-Okay!

131
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,739
Okay...

132
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,480
Just... Don't do anything...

133
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,609
Wrong... Okay?

134
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,690
Please?

135
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,590
What's wrong with you?

136
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,880
That's not how you think...

137
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:42,760
I'm sorry if you mind my saying it, but why should Amna and the kids leave this place and live with you when the Army's gonna provide them with housing? It doesn't make sense.

138
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,181
Of course.

139
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:47,980
The Unit will provide them everything they need. They always do.

140
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,150
They don't need to move out of the city...

141
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:02,820
You're in Pakistan. There's all sorts of problems for young widows and girls living alone here... Even in a garrison.

142
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,910
Unless one of you can take her along to the UK or the US...

143
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:18,121
It won't be easy to arrange for the immigration of the entire family...

144
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:21,541
But I've proposed Sarah's marriage...

145
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:26,060
If she's okay with it, she can marry my son as soon as she's done with med school.

146
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,310
Except Amna doesn't want her daughter to marry your son.

147
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,078
I've talked to her about my son long ago.

148
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,308
She never told me!

149
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:40,558
When'd you talk to him about anything of the sort?

150
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:46,120
Not exactly --
-I talked to Sherali himself!

151
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,288
And he said he's fine with it... Once Sarah's done with her studies.

152
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:59,838
He didn't tell any of us. Or Mum and Dad, for that reason. Innit?

153
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,770
I know my brother never wanted his kids married off in haste.

154
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,107
Sherali never said anything of the sort.
-D'you think I'm lying?

155
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:16,079
Why'd I need to?

156
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,838
I mean, it's possible he didn't get the chance to tell you...

157
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:27,808
But he said to me exactly what I'm saying he did.

158
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,284
But what'd you care?

159
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:41,570
We're lending our family a hand... But it seems you'd much rather brand me a liar and show me the door!

160
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,950
See that?

161
00:13:56,072 --> 00:13:59,083
There is still time... Think again.

162
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:03,693
But don't even think about going over to your brother's.

163
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,840
Why ye an' Anurag 'av ter say anythin' ter Sunanda?

164
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,289
What'd we say?

165
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:24,158
They just need an excuse to insult you!

166
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:25,489
No.

167
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,030
Yer don't care aboyt me insult. Yer only care aboyt de estate.

168
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:38,480
Who de divil towl yer she wants ter usurp de estate? Or dat she's usin' Vishal ter blackmail me?

169
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:47,545
You're saying what they want to hear. Yet you don't want to admit she's blackmailing you.

170
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,489
When'd you become so money-grubbing? Ain't yer family?

171
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,074
Mum...

172
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,904
You want to see me divorced?

173
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:03,015
All alone here in Canada?

174
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,588
Between grieving over my dead brother and struggling to make ends meet... Who've I got to support me?

175
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,168
He's not dead...

176
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,689
He's a hero...

177
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,709
A martyr...

178
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,521
The nation pays its respects to him... But you just say he's 'dead'?

179
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,864
You've always sided with Vijay...

180
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:28,840
Against me...

181
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,137
So you do even now!

182
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:37,660
What d'you care if Pratibha lives or dies? Your world ended with Vijay.

183
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,010
I came all the way from Karachi for you.

184
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,010
I've been running from office to office for you.

185
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:53,181
But you want to call me a liar before your in-laws?
-I couldn't let you lie about Sherali.

186
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:58,951
I wouldn't have said anything if it were about me... But --
-Your blasted in-laws...

187
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:03,472
Have got their eyes on your wealth... And this house.

188
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:09,551
I'm sure they know what the Unit's gonna give you.

189
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:15,541
Now they're just hungering for everything you're gonna get.

190
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,038
That's what they said about you.

191
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,931
You...

192
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:28,900
You dare say your brother's hungering for your wealth?

193
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:31,686
My wife was right...

194
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:33,901
Kindness never gets repaid...

195
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,591
It was no use coming here...

196
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:43,017
But I guess I was wrong to care for my widowed sister... Feel for her...

197
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,480
I was wrong to help the martyr's kids...

198
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:54,198
But... If you're so happy with your in-laws... Fine by me!

199
00:16:54,272 --> 00:17:01,613
Tell them to call their husbands here so they can help you with this red tape!

200
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:05,150
If they think the Unit's gonna do everything...

201
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,540
Tell them this ain't London or the US of bloody A!

202
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,929
I'm just telling you what they said...

203
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,979
Well let me make it clear that I don't want to hear it from you!

204
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:27,888
And let me make it clear that Sarah's not gonna marry anyone except Hammad!

205
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,658
They just want to burden you with their ageing parents!

206
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:39,109
They're using every trick in the book so they don't have to look after them!

207
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:47,650
You don't get brothers willing to take care of the entire family these days... It ain't easy for anyone...

208
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,650
We've rented the flat upstairs out.

209
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,460
For fifty thousand a month.

210
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,240
But I'm gonna ask the tenant to leave...

211
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,020
But I'm gonna ask the tenant to leave... For you.

212
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,808
Aunt... Uncle...

213
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,999
They were all...

214
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,140
Family...

215
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,911
When Dad was around...

216
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,960
But...

217
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,610
I can barely recognise...

218
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,493
What they've become...

219
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,488
Dad...

220
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,701
I never knew how much it mattered to have you around...

221
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,991
I was just close to my Mum...

222
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,928
Hello?
-I was thinking of you... Thought I'd ask you what you'd done about your Mum.

223
00:19:31,928 --> 00:19:37,669
What's wrong with everyone? Out of nowhere... We're neck-deep in problems...

224
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,532
You or me?

225
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,971
What do you mean?
-Same here.

226
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:49,089
The entire blimmin' family's set up camp here. Talking about the strangest things... Demanding the strangest things...

227
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:53,590
I always knew we didn't have many people around us...

228
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,230
But after Dad's gone... I've come to see how hollow they can all be...

229
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,128
Same here...

230
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:05,838
The war between our nations has claimed many lives...

231
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,368
But much more importantly...

232
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:12,448
It's exposed cold-blooded blood ties.

233
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:13,728
Aye...

234
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,596
Absolutely...

235
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:19,686
I talked to one of Mum's friends...

236
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,910
She said she'll talk to Mum... But there's a truckload of issues between Mum and Granny...

237
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,590
And then there's this Aunt...

238
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,489
Dad's sister...

239
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,130
Her husband wants Granny to sell her estate and give them their share.

240
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,192
As in where you live?
-No, this place is ours...

241
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:44,928
Granny's got an estate she's rented out.

242
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:48,909
I've got my Aunts... In the UK and the US...

243
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,380
And my Uncle. He wants us to move to his place.

244
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,139
Mum, me, and my brother and sister...

245
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:59,406
He wants Granny and Grandpa to live with my Aunts...

246
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:02,396
Who don't want to keep them.

247
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:07,156
One lives with her in-laws... And the other doesn't have enough room for them.

248
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:10,007
Same here... More or less...

249
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:18,310
My Uncle thinks we're exploiting Granny, Mum and me...

250
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,200
So she can give us everything...

251
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,662
So she can live with us. Crazy, innit?

252
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,968
H -- He doesn't know...

253
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,630
That Mum's asking Granny...

254
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,155
To go to her place...

255
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:38,020
And I'm the only one who's stopping her...

256
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,298
I don't want to be away from Granny and Grandpa either...

257
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:53,709
I can't live without them... And I'm sure they can't live without us either...

258
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,837
You crying?

259
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,037
Vishal?

260
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,329
C'mon...

261
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,260
Sarah... Your Uncle's staying in my room, so me and the kids will be here with you.
-Yeah?

262
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,080
Where are you off to?
-Need some water...

263
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:12,817
Same here. The entire blimmin' family's set up camp here. Talking about the strangest things... Demanding the strangest things...

264
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,859
The war between our nations has claimed many lives...

265
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:21,400
But much more importantly...

266
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,169
It's exposed cold-blooded blood ties.

267
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,528
Who's Vishal?

268
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,295
Colonel Vijay Malhotra's son.

269
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:18,543
Are you telling me you call and talk to him?

270
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,008
Mum...

271
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:28,230
He's very worried...

272
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,186
In a mess...

273
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:32,930
More than us?

274
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,845
You've been nattering away with our enemy and you say he's worried?

275
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,108
I know he's the enemy...

276
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:46,588
But is he more hostile than those we hold dear?

277
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:51,867
His Mum's on drugs...

278
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:54,317
He's distressed...

279
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,039
Drugs?

280
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,091
They're in the same mess as us...

281
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:04,150
His Mum hasn't come to terms with his Dad's death.

282
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,770
His Aunt wants his Granny to sell her estate and give her her share.

283
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:14,079
His Granny doesn't want to be left with nothing and no one.

284
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,230
Our kind of mess through and through.

285
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,420
But... It's his Mum he's most worried about.

286
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,920
She's suicidal...

287
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,951
Did you tell him everything going on here?

288
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,979
Yeah...

289
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:38,909
Who did I have?

290
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:43,019
Who'd listen to me here?

291
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,298
Everything's gonna be alright...

292
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,418
This, too, shall pass...

293
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,708
It will...

294
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,050
But its memories...

295
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,798
Will come back to haunt us...

296
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,938
You're never talking to Vishal again. Okay?

297
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,150
I've got boys in my class...

298
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,690
I'm friends with some too...

299
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,110
It's the same with him... Just... Friends...

300
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,147
What's it matter, anyway?

301
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,058
We're enemies...

302
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:41,089
But don't they suffer all the same?

303
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,518
Who told you?

304
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:03,108
Vishal.

305
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:06,878
You asked him to get you some pills.

306
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,880
You're a doctor.

307
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,600
You know what they're gonna do to you.

308
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:15,563
I do...

309
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,875
You can't let yourself go like that.

310
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,685
What else can I do?

311
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:22,616
I've got this --

312
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:23,940
Thing --

313
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,537
Gnawing at me...

314
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:28,839
Burning me... Killing me...

315
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:31,318
These pills...

316
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,919
Soothe it...

317
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,450
They don't.

318
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,940
They just make it seem like it.

319
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,657
They just give you the hope that it's all a nightmare...

320
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:47,843
We can only run from it so far... And anyway -- Doing drugs?

321
00:27:47,843 --> 00:27:50,366
Vishal's very upset.

322
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:56,018
I should not have asked him to get the pills... Why'd I even think --

323
00:27:56,018 --> 00:28:00,478
You've got to stop taking them. They're killing you!

324
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,664
I can't...

325
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,978
I've been taking them for years...

326
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,978
What?

327
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,528
For years?

328
00:28:11,528 --> 00:28:13,219
Why?

329
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,130
Ever since Vijay was deployed in Kashmir... His hardship post, you know...

330
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,938
I started taking these sedatives...

331
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:30,268
Because I used to have panic attacks... Anxiety...

332
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:47,249
Every soldier's wife dies in limbo... All day... All night...

333
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:58,991
I've lived all these years, fearing the call I got that day...

334
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:05,658
Every day, I've lived dreading bad news...

335
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:13,358
Vijay's call... Could make me sleep in peace... But... Anytime...

336
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:16,520
He couldn't take my call...

337
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,850
It felt like...

338
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:22,206
A noose around my neck...

339
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,107
There was this Captain whose wife used these...

340
00:29:28,107 --> 00:29:31,593
That's how I started taking them...

341
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:37,290
Many soldiers' wives take these pills...

342
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,451
Their husbands put their lives on the line...

343
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:43,855
While we live on the brink here...

344
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:48,755
But you never told me... Talked to me about it...

345
00:29:48,846 --> 00:29:52,597
Never thought you could share it with your friend...

346
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,444
No...

347
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,813
It's my dark secret...

348
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,094
No one knows about it...

349
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:02,124
Not even Vijay...

350
00:30:02,124 --> 00:30:04,755
He didn't have a clue...

351
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:07,565
What could he do anyway?

352
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:10,050
Worry? Get furious?

353
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,968
But surely not understand it...

354
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,618
Anyway...

355
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:19,928
What's done's done... You got to stop taking them.

356
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:23,939
You're past that fear.
-Aye.

357
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:29,499
But there's this aching wound in me...

358
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:31,888
I need something to ease it...

359
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,906
The memories...

360
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:37,970
All around me... Gnawing...

361
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,630
I want an escape...

362
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:47,008
The echoes in my ears... Especially Vijay's...

363
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,950
'Hun'... That's what he used to call me...

364
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,700
'Hun'...

365
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,188
Look at your kids...

366
00:30:59,188 --> 00:31:00,529
Pari...

367
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:01,620
Pari... Laxmi...

368
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,733
Pari... Laxmi... Vishal...

369
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,320
Everyone...

370
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,254
Everyone here needs you, Sunanda...

371
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:12,127
It ain't that hard to get over it all...

372
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:15,100
You just need to take a step...

373
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,050
Or it'll drive you crazy!

374
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,166
It's already driven me crazy!

375
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,708
You're my friend.

376
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:29,138
My best friend.

377
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,510
I won't let you destroy yourself like that...

378
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,018
I'll get you treated...

379
00:31:39,017 --> 00:31:42,407
But you need to be strong.

380
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:45,701
Let me help you.

381
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,440
What'd your Uncle say?
-What?

382
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,899
He wanted you to move to his place... In Karachi...

383
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,456
Did he say anything about it?

384
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,000
Tell Mum to take a stand for herself... And us...

385
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,201
We can live without them - Uncle, Aunt...

386
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:22,700
If we can live without Sherali, we can sure as heck live without their lot!

387
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:30,390
And -- Aunt wants me for her son... Uncle wants me for his... I don't want to be caught in the crossfire...

388
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,290
You should've turned Aunt down the first time she said it.

389
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,430
How could I turn her down?

390
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:42,670
Everyone thinks of old men as dimwits...

391
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,130
Because he's helpless...

392
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,140
In need...

393
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,190
You're not helpless...

394
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,178
What makes you think so?

395
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:59,690
I've spent everything I've earned on my kids...

396
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,314
Their studies...

397
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,594
Weddings...

398
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:12,100
I never saved anything for myself...

399
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,498
I always thought...

400
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:19,737
I've got Sherali...

401
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:24,549
To support me as I grow old...

402
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,490
But now that we've got to spend...

403
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,922
At this point of our lives...

404
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:35,400
We've come to realise...

405
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,879
That we've got nothing...

406
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:42,530
Me and your Granny...

407
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,427
Nothing...

408
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,389
We can't even...

409
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:53,029
Get a cramped little shack...

410
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:57,129
In the middle of nowhere... Just for the two of us...

411
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,661
Where we could live...

412
00:34:01,661 --> 00:34:05,260
The last of our days...

413
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,497
In peace...

414
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,470
That's why I want you to take a stand.

415
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,728
Why are we so helpless?

416
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,918
We can't live without you.

417
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,187
The Army's gonna provide us housing. That's all we need.

418
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:32,379
Talk to Mum. She'll listen to you.

419
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,829
Sarah...

420
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:35,780
Your Mum...

421
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,688
Is a woman like no other...

422
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,428
I don't want her to think...

423
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:44,488
That we're self-seeking...

424
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,048
That we care about ourselves...

425
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:52,848
But not your lives...

426
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,030
Our kind of mess through and through.

427
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:10,008
But... It's his Mum he's most worried about.

428
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:12,479
She's suicidal...

429
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,847
Serve lunch. And check on the cleaner... Where's he?

430
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,890
There's something...

431
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,320
I wanted to ask...

432
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,851
Yeah?

433
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,978
My sister's getting married... I'd need a bit of a leave...

434
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,931
How many days?

435
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,601
A month...

436
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:47,801
I've got to arrange everything... As I told you four months back...

437
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:51,382
You know what's going on here, Nawab...

438
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:54,432
Guests and all...

439
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,890
It'll be like this for a while...

440
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,009
I've got no choice...

441
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:04,018
I didn't want to leave right now either...

442
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:09,872
But her in-laws won't settle for another date.

443
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,228
Okay... You may leave...

444
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:17,969
Thank you so much.

445
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:21,439
I'll be back as soon as the wedding's done.

446
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,410
Thank you, Aunt Shefali...

447
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,799
It's nothing...

448
00:36:27,036 --> 00:36:29,666
I've sorted it out...

449
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:36,016
I'm taking Sunanda to a psychiatrist... I've talked to one.

450
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:40,726
She'll be fine. She wants to be fine.

451
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,484
Just make sure...

452
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:47,375
Yeah?

453
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,278
That Sunanda doesn't get stressed or worried.

454
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:56,439
I hope you'll take care of her.

455
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,870
I'll get going.
-Thank you.

456
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,668
Hello?

457
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:32,918
Hello. I hope I didn't call at the wrong time.

458
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:38,068
I'm at school... Working on a diagram for my bio practical journal...

459
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:39,264
Which one?

460
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,928
The human heart...

461
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,117
Seriously?

462
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,418
You're laughing?

463
00:37:45,418 --> 00:37:49,039
I wonder what kind of a heart you're drawing...

464
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:56,078
You were crying the other day...
-Jesus, you girls remember everything, don't you? Always ready to continue!

465
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:57,859
Why?

466
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,349
When you wanted to die...

467
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,350
I asked you why...

468
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,710
Remember?

469
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,600
You want to get even?
-Of course. We're enemies, aren't we?

470
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,940
It's only fair.

471
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:11,822
How's your Mum?

472
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,521
Thank you.

473
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,701
For?

474
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:19,919
You said I should talk to one of her friends.

475
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,280
I did.

476
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,220
Things are better now.

477
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,711
She's ready to see a psychiatrist.

478
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm happy for her.

479
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:32,930
And... Mum's found out I talk to you.

480
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,990
How?

481
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,558
She was in my room that night... When you called...

482
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:41,518
And?
-She was angry...

483
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:45,010
She asked me never to talk to you again.

484
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,792
What'd you say?

485
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:50,873
I promised her I'll never talk to you again...

486
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,578
And... That's what I wanted to tell you...

487
00:38:55,578 --> 00:39:00,340
But -- What's wrong with it? We can talk, can't we?

488
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:05,410
I can't disobey Mum... Can't disappoint her...

489
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,250
No -- I don't mean -- But -- Can I text you? Like now and then?

490
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:16,678
It's better if you don't. You'd have many friends... You'd hardly miss me.

491
00:39:16,678 --> 00:39:19,518
Many friends, aye... But only one enemy.

492
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:21,088
Aye...

493
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,720
Same here...

494
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,092
Take care of your Mum...

495
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:28,702
And Pari, and Laxmi...

496
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,620
And...

497
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Yourself...

498
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
