00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,396
Sarah...

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,625
I want straight A*s from you... Not even a single A, okay?

23
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,224
Okay, boss...
-Good.

24
00:01:46,224 --> 00:01:48,173
By the way...

25
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:53,040
Don't send her to the kitchen again. Forget this baking and stuff...

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,530
What d'you mean? She's a girl! She ought to know!
-So what?

27
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,760
You want her in the kitchen all day?

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,650
No. Don't waste her time.

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,910
Girls ought to know. Boys ought to know too...

But this is my lovely girl...

31
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,740
I want her to become a doctor... I'll send her overseas for her specialisation! Okay?

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,838
Leave the cooking to Nawab...

33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:28,510
She's your girl. Raise her like one. She doesn't need these dreams of higher degrees and all... Not when she doesn't want to grow into a woman!

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,090
Don't listen to your Mum, okay?

35
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,513
Don't worry. I never do.
-Good.

36
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:36,058

Hay

58
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:52,004
why

59
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,493
what happend

60
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,580
Why'd she take my call?

61
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,909
But why am I calling <i>her</i>?

62
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,460
What am I thinking?

63
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,998
As if I haven't got my hands full already!

64
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,789
Uh... Hello?

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,594
Sarah?

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,022
You there?

67
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,526
Yes...

68
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,811
Alright?

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,286
No...

70
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,115
What is it?

71
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,100
Something bothering you?

72
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,525
Just missing Dad...

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,381
Same... Here...

74
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,978
I don't know what to say...

75
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:08,586
I don't know how I could comfort a girl... A woman...

76
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,389
But all I've seen since Dad passed away... Is tears... Always someone or the other!

77
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,910
You're laughing?
-I'm a man...

78
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,204
Men can't cry.

79
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:31,284
But you gotta be brave... You're the eldest...

80
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,656
You gotta be brave... For yourself... And your family...

81
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,832
How d'you know I'm the eldest kid in the family?
-I just know...

82
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:47,379
I've been reading about your family on social media for weeks...

83
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm sure you've been too...

84
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:54,927
You're the eldest kid too...
-Aye.

85
00:06:55,884 --> 00:07:01,773
The misery, the problems... We are the same... The eldest kids suffering...

86
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,930
But you're lucky. Unlike me.
-Why?

87
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,784
What happened to you? Girls face all the problems.

88
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,334
So they say...

89
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:18,743
But you'd know better if you were in my place.

90
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:24,392
I've got four women at my place... Me Mum, Granny, and twin sisters...

91
00:07:24,392 --> 00:07:29,186
I've got no idea what I should tell any of them... At any time!

92
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:33,309
Suddenly, I'm supposed to be Mr Responsible.

93
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:35,916
But you're a girl. It's easy for you.

94
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,902
Aye, I've got it easy.

95
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,054
No responsibilities.

96
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:49,227
Just... Grandpa, Granny... My wee brother and sister... Mum, who's never stepped out of the house...

97
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:56,885
The only man in my family is seven. So yeah, you're right... No one expects anything of me.

98
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:59,561
That why you're crying?
-No.

99
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:03,295
I told you... Just missing Dad...

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:11,522
But why are we talking about it? Why am I telling you any of it? We're enemies, aren't we? My Dad... Because of your bloody old man!

101
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,247
Aye...

102
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,662
So we are. Sworn enemies...

103
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:20,089
Your old man's responsible for everything we're going through!

104
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:28,430
And -- What an idiot I am... What was I thinking, asking you why you're crying? Sympathising with you? You lot are the reason we're all crying!

105
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:36,525
In that case... Why d'you even bother to call me and ask me about my problems? I'm not begging for your sympathies!

106
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:54,965
Oh-so-kind of you to talk to me!

107
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,962
To the devil with her... Her tears... Sympathies...

108
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:23,510
That's why I told you... Don't expect anything from her... Or her lot...

109
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,010
But you had to kiss up to her!

110
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,276
How could I know she'd yell at Mum like that?

111
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:37,468
I would've loved to see her dare with Vijay around!

112
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,860
She dares <i>because</i> he's not around...

113
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,880
That's why I asked you to tell Mum to give us our share quickly... Get it?

114
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,032
Sunanda won't let Mum give us anything.

115
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:59,821
Besides... She's growing old...

116
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:03,562
It's easy to exploit her emotions...

117
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,182
I'm telling you... Vishal's gonna be Sunanda's next target!

118
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,989
Were it so easy...

119
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:22,220
I won't stop until I've got my share.

120
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,371
I'm just worried for Mum...

121
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,096
What if Sunanda kicked her out?

122
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,775
I told you...

123
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:39,380
They're gonna explot her...

124
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:44,540
I'm sure Vishal told her that... Scared her and all...

125
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,326
Now they're gonna sell everything without a mouse stirring!

126
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,910
I get what you're saying... But I'm comfused...

127
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,856
Why?

128
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,530
Your Mum's got your Dad's pension.

129
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,410
That's enough for her.

130
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:18,253
She can rent a place... Live as a paying guest...

131
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,550
She wouldn't like to...

132
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,463
She isn't used to it...

133
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,806
You're only worried for your Mum...

134
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,851
Not the kids...

135
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,550
And yeah...

136
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,390
Let me talk to Sunanda...

137
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,810
Or you're just gonna play ping-pong with her...

138
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,214
Sherali's Dad...

139
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:18,989
First time I've heard you call me that in years...

140
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:24,989
I thought the kids wouldn't like it.

141
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,296
That's why I gave up...

142
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,400
But now I feel...

143
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,550
That Sherali...

144
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,874
Was the only one who ever cared...

145
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:52,332
They say daughters - not sons - support their parents as they grow old...

146
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:57,032
Granted we...

147
00:12:57,032 --> 00:13:01,362
Never wanted to live with them...

148
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,350
But...

149
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,090
I never thought...

150
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:12,056
They'd refuse to let us live with them.

151
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,866
They didn't refuse...

152
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:19,481
They've got no choice...

153
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:22,924
You know it very well.

154
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,760
Aye...

155
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,973
Daughters have no choice...

156
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,545
Can't complain...

157
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:36,845
Mothers have no choice but to cover up for them either...

158
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:42,200
First time I've felt...

159
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,164
That we're growing old...

160
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:48,700
And a burden...

161
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:52,970
Now I know...

162
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,134
Why we're all destined to die...

163
00:13:57,134 --> 00:14:00,070
The Lord God wants the likes of us...

164
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,410
To find some peace in death...

165
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,165
And leave without burdening anyone...

166
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,520
Leave with respect...

167
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,940
And...

168
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,998
What about those of Sherali's age who leave?

169
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:21,697
They don't have to leave the world...

170
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,640
They don't burden anyone...

171
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,580
Don't ask me anything...

172
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,250
That'd make me choose between staying quiet...

173
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,507
And lying to you...

174
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,942
Get up. You're getting late for school...

175
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,349
Blimey, you've got a fever!

176
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:34,354
Why didn't you tell me?

177
00:15:34,354 --> 00:15:37,230
I don't want to get married...

178
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,038
Who said anything to you?

179
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,101
I heard what she said...

180
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:46,903
Not right away...

181
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,629
Once you and Zuber have completed your studies?

182
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,439
I just don't want to...

183
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,493
I want to be here. With you. Not in another part of the world.

184
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,927
You can't be here all your life.

185
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,081
Says who?

186
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,200
With Dad gone...

187
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,843
Who else've you got?

188
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,794
Grandpa... Granny... Nadir... Noria... Who else've they got?

189
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,888
Don't worry about any of that. Just focus on your studies.

190
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,886
I don't want to get married. To anyone.

191
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,404
Would you do this if Dad were here?

192
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,488
A lot more would never've happened if your Dad were here...

193
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,894
C'mon, get up. Have your breakfast. You need to see a doctor...

194
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,470
Vishal... We wanna go to the park... It's playtime...

195
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,150
Can't you see I'm studying?

196
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,373
I can't. Take us to the park.

197
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,323
Out.

198
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,049
And... Don't come back until I say.

199
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,980
Mum said no.

200
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,181
You said no.

201
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,210
Dad's not coming back.

202
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,441
Who do we go out with?

203
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,943
Change o' plans.

204
00:17:54,045 --> 00:18:00,958
Tell Laxmi to get ready.
-Laxmi! Get ready, Vishal's taking us to the park!

205
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,908
Mum...

206
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,685
Mum...
-Hmm?

207
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:18,570
I'm taking Pari and Laxmi to the park... How say you come with us?

208
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,362
Mhm...

209
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,607
Just for a while...

210
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:29,342
Sit in the park... You'll feel good...

211
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,140
What good is it?

212
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,124
But...

213
00:18:36,124 --> 00:18:38,940
Could you...

214
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,840
Get me...

215
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,281
These medicines...

216
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,144
On your way back?

217
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,066
I talked to Atif last night...

218
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:15,850
He said he can come here for a few days if you need help with filing for welfare and all...

219
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,976
I thought it's great. You don't seriously think you can bear all the red tape... Not in mourning, surely?

220
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:30,090
Badar said he's coming to help me... He'll sort it out... Atif doesn't need to come all the way...

221
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,490
This blind trust will hurt you, Amna...

222
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,890
I mean -- He's your brother, but this is about money...

223
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,942
The more people are involved, the less likely it is that anyone's gonna break that trust.

224
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,139
I don't get it.

225
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,600
Put plainly, 'Don't trust anyone - not even your siblings - in matters of money'.

226
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,887
I hear the welfare is quite a lot...

227
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,678
So it's best for you and kids that Atif's here with us.

228
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:10,639
I wanted Zafar to be here too...

229
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:12,770
But...

230
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,885
He only cares about <i>his</i> family.

231
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:25,960
Badar's fortunate to have everything he needs... Why'd he eye his widowed sister's welfare?

232
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,526
No, you're getting it wrong -- I don't mean he's eyeing the welfare...

233
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:37,220
Just... That we should involve a few more people...

234
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,275
As witnesses?

235
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,336
Call him if you want, but I don't think we're gonna need it.

236
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:48,613
Badar will do what's best for me and the kids.

237
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:53,474
Why'd he want anything less?

238
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,099
He cares for us just like you. We're family.

239
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,752
I told you...

240
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:08,555
She's honest-to-goodness.

241
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,776
With that blind faith, you can bet she won't even bother to ask him about anything.

242
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,250
Leave it... She'll find out in time...

243
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,776
I'll have another glass...

244
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,367
Dey're joehst like Vijay...

245
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,535
Energetic... Lively...

246
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,413
'E cooehldn't set fahr a mahment when 'e was deir age!

247
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:59,831
Always ready to play... In 'igh spirets...

248
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,330
Once more!

249
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,680
And when he couldn't have his way...

250
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,382
He'd run off from home...

251
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,285
He was our only son...

252
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:16,938
For many years...

253
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,360
He was our world...

254
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,548
Mine and your Grandpa's...

255
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:29,317
The best years of our lives...

256
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,596
Vishal...
-Hmm?

257
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,080
Dere's sahmethin...

258
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,908
Dat's messin...

259
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,830
In 'ere... Me 'eart...

260
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,770
'As lahst its reasahn to go ahn...

261
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,226
Mind if I say something?
-No?

262
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:44,622
That's some heavy medication, kid. Not good for you.

263
00:23:44,622 --> 00:23:47,889
Did you consult a doctor?

264
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,346
I don't get it.
-All these pills have side-effects.

265
00:23:52,346 --> 00:23:57,560
Keep taking them and you'll be addicted to cocaine and weed in a few months.

266
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,865
Nothing else will calm you.

267
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,500
You're young.

268
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,422
Like a son.

269
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:07,075
That's why I'm telling you.

270
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,655
But -- They're all antidepressants, right?
-Aye.

271
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:12,904
Aye.

272
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:16,140
But in the long run... They'll destroy you up here...

273
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,892
And here...

274
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,080
Anyway...

275
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,179
That'll be 3,272.

276
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:44,636
That's some heavy medication, kid. Keep taking them and you'll be addicted to cocaine and weed in a few months.

277
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,516
Nothing else will calm you.

278
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,243
You're young.

279
00:24:50,243 --> 00:24:52,120
Like a son.

280
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,992
That's why I'm telling you.

281
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,141
Hello?
-Hello...

282
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,105
I think...

283
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:24,951
I was too rude the other day...

284
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,706
Could you help me?

285
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:29,054
Yeah.

286
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:35,237
Mum's on these antidepressants... And -- whatcha call them? Sedatives...

287
00:26:35,237 --> 00:26:44,193
The chemist told me they're no good... She'll get addicted to it... If she isn't already...

288
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:52,099
I -- I feel very helpless -- What... What now?

289
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,879
Hello?

290
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,050
You there?

291
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,691
Yeah, but... Why don't you talk to her? Instead of getting her the pills...

292
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:12,480
First time she asked me to get her the pills... I had no idea what she's been taking with her sleeping pills!
-Talk to her. Tell her not to take them.

293
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,986
Talk to her. Tell her not to take them.
-She won't listen to me!

294
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:15,711
She won't listen to me!
-Anyone else she'd listen to?

295
00:27:15,711 --> 00:27:20,023
Anyone else she'd listen to? Grandpa? Granny? An Uncle or Aunt?

296
00:27:20,023 --> 00:27:25,640
Not on me Mum's side... And she ain't on the finest terms with her MIL.

297
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,141
A friend perhaps? Hers or of the family? Someone she'd listen to?

298
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:35,728
Aye... There's one...

299
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,884
Aunt Shefali...

300
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:41,073
Actually --

301
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,011
I'll get back to you, Sarah... Uncle's calling from Canada...

302
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:51,280
Sure... But... Please help your Mum any way you can.

303
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,222
Yeah... I'll do something...

304
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,170
Thanks...

305
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,080
Hi, Uncle.
-'Sup, Vishal?

306
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,537
Great. And you? Aunt?

307
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,045
Great. Could I talk to Mum?

308
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:14,120
She turned in.

309
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,730
No...

310
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,729
Ah, right...

311
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,660
I'll talk to Sunanda then.

312
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,016
Okay. Just a sec.

313
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,523
Mum... It's Uncle Anurag.

314
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:30,967
So?

315
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,430
So... He wants to talk...

316
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,704
About what?

317
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:44,418
Why don't you find out? I'm sure they're just checking on you...
-Alright...

318
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,664
Hello?

319
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,771
How are you?

320
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,106
Okay...

321
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,552
You?

322
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:53,917
Great.

323
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,372
And Pratibha?

324
00:28:55,372 --> 00:28:59,780
She's great too. She says hi.

325
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,984
Tell her I said hello.

326
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,659
Sure.

327
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,383
Sunanda...

328
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:10,091
We need to talk...

329
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:11,143
Yeah?

330
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:15,169
About Mum's estate, you know...

331
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:18,939
Pratibha wants her share...

332
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:24,770
Why don't you talk to Mum?

333
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,583
We've talked to her. Not just once.

334
00:29:28,648 --> 00:29:35,772
But Pratibha and I think she's a bit reluctant because of you and VIshal...

335
00:29:35,772 --> 00:29:39,240
So we thought we'd talk to you.

336
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,010
Because of me and Vishal?

337
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,724
Why?

338
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:47,599
It's her estate... She can do what she wants...

339
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,320
Rent it out like right now or --

340
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,402
That's what we're saying... You're not gonna need it now...

341
00:29:55,402 --> 00:30:00,109
The Government's gonna provide you housing and all...

342
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:05,080
Why'd you need her estate?

343
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,386
But we do...

344
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,653
You know how it is here...

345
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,587
If you could ask Mum to sell it...

346
00:30:18,912 --> 00:30:21,746
What do I tell her?

347
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:27,030
It's not like she does as I say.

348
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,030
But I'm sure she'd listen to you.

349
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,441
As always.

350
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:36,652
I'm sure she'll do as you say.

351
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:42,130
By the way, why don't you take Mum with you? To Canada?

352
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,823
What? What are you saying?

353
00:30:45,823 --> 00:30:48,976
How can she live here?

354
00:30:49,052 --> 00:30:56,000
She doesn't have a visa... And even if she did, you know the houses here!

355
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,790
Mum can't manage it without servants.

356
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:04,700
She's happy with you... Why d'you want to kick her out?

357
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,398
Aye, Anurag...

358
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:10,883
She's happy with me...

359
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:13,883
Lowly me. Oh, please...

360
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:19,072
Which of you chinless wonders would be happy with lowly me?

361
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:24,070
Mum's the same as you two. She'd rather be with you.

362
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,574
Sunanda...

363
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:30,226
Lowly or not, I never thought you'd be so low and flat!

364
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,340
Excuse me!

365
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,261
Sunanda... Let's not start a row over it...

366
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:43,361
Why d'you want to pressure Mum when we can all get our shares peacefully?

367
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:47,484
And how dare you use Vishal to blackmail us emotionally?

368
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:53,350
I'm using Vishal to usurp your share? I'm not like you!

369
00:31:53,350 --> 00:32:00,440
Don't make me start... If we started talking, it will get ugly! There will be blood!

370
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,439
Oh, do what you want! I'm sick of staying quiet!

371
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,172
I couldn't believe it until I heard it today...

372
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:15,640
But I always knew you're using Vishal to usurp Mum's estate!

373
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,492
You know I won't let that happen.

374
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:21,860
No way you're snatching my share from me!

375
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,940
I've got kids too!

376
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,813
You're entitled to welfare. Housing.

377
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:32,924
But we're struggling to pay back our mortgage here!

378
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:37,000
Aunt... I'll do as you say...

379
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,117
I'll talk to Granny...

380
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:42,350
Vishal...

381
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,005
How --

382
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,030
Can't believe she gave you the phone!

383
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:51,162
Good Heavens... Your Mum wants to drive a wedge between us!

384
00:32:51,272 --> 00:32:57,910
She says Vijay's memory lives on in there... She wants you and Mum to hate me!

385
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,635
Vishal...

386
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,853
It's good that you know...

387
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:05,170
But don't worry... Nothing we can't sort out...

388
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,400
We're coming to India in a few weeks.

389
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,980
So...

390
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,417
Talk to Mum, okay?

391
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,904
Convince Sunanda too.

392
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:17,289
I'll get back to you. Bye.

393
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,856
Bye.

394
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:25,080
Get your hands on what you can while they live... And everything they leave behind! That's the name of the game...

395
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,936
Get your hands on what you can while they live... And everything they leave behind! That's the name of the game...
-Mum...

396
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:27,940
Mum...

397
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000

398
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,808
You'd have many friends...

399
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:45,736
Aye... But only one enemy.

400
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:49,414
Aye... Same here...

401
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,794
You're never talking to Vishal again.

402
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:53,290
We're enemies...

403
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,407
But don't they suffer all the same?

404
00:33:56,407 --> 00:34:01,890
The war between our nations has claimed many lives...

405
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,977
But much more importantly... It's exposed cold-blooded blood ties.
