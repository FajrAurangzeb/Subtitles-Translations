Episode 15 - 'Compromises'

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,588
how was the exam ??

22
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:27,591

did you pray for me

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,392
did you pray for me ?

38
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:36,441
All day.

39
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:37,017
i

40
00:01:37,017 --> 00:01:37,222

it was a doddl

50
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:39,360
it was a doddle

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,548
it was a doddle m

52
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:39,724
it was a doddle ma

53
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,038
it was a doddle mat

54
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:41,700
it was a doddle mate

55
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,459
so... officially engineer Vishal now ?

56
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:45,589
n

57
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:45,855
no

58
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,210
not

59
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,394
not s

60
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:47,742
not so

61
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,052
not so f

62
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:48,396
not so fa

63
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:48,693
not so fas

64
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,945
not so fast

65
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,600
It'd be an honour to have the late Colonel Sherali's daughter as our daughter-in-law.

66
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,801
I talked to Aunt Sofia the other day.

67
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:06,706
We're here to talk to you today.

68
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:14,565
We always wanted Cüneyt to marry into the family of a war hero. We hold the Colonel in the highest regard.

69
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:19,730
Thank you so much for this proposal...

70
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,666
But...

71
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,948
I don't want to get Sarah married off just yet...

72
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:30,240
Yeah, Aunt Sofia mentioned you'd rather she graduate first...

73
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,539
We've got no problem with it... She can get engaged now...

74
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,988
Sarah doesn't even want to think about it right now...

75
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:44,548
She wants to focus on her studies.

76
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,933
Besides...

77
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,997
She's too young...

78
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:54,786
I understand that kids don't like getting engaged young... We don't, either...

79
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:58,236
But we're here to honour Cüneyt's wish...

80
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:01,222
And we'd ask you to think about it...

81
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,049
Just once?

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,170
Maybe, if Sarah and Cüneyt met each other...?

83
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,598
We'd like to talk to Sarah first.

84
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,381
If she's okay with seeing him...

85
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,989
We'll let you know...

86
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,091
Sarah!

87
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,732
Hey!

88
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,580
Hey...

89
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,810
I didn't know you come here for a walk.

90
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,887
Just started a few days ago...

91
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,018
Me too.

92
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:52,792
By the way...

93
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:54,573
You're here alone?

94
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:58,835
My place ain't that far... So... I thought I'd come here for a stroll...

95
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,321
I'm on my way back.

96
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,280
Well... Guess what? Me too.

97
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,297
Come with me?

98
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,357
As a soldier... I like to get straight to the point...

99
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,169
There's something I wanted to say...

100
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm sure you know what it's about.

101
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,015
If it's about your proposal, please don't...

102
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,611
I heard you don't want to get married just yet?

103
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,966
In fact...

104
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:34,911
You rejected the proposal?

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,450
May I know...

106
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,648
May I know why?

107
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,055
I'm the eldest daughter...

108
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,766
I've got responsibilities...

109
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,041
I can't take such a huge decision right now...

110
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,301
I can... Wait... If that's what --

111
00:04:59,301 --> 00:05:02,379
I don't want to waste your time.

112
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,001
Your parents said they wanted to get you married ASAP.

113
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,753
When I hadn't met you, aye...

114
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:14,964
But I can wait...

115
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,965
For you...

116
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,101
Can you wait five years?

117
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,500
If you don't want to be a Captain's wife...

118
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,270
Would you like to be a Major's?

119
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,826
I don't want to be a soldier's wife...

120
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,440
A soldier's daughter...

121
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,741
Doesn't want to be a soldier's wife?

122
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,838
Odd.

123
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,672
I'm a martyr's daughter.

124
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:54,680
Perhaps it sounds less odd this way.

125
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,966
Martyrdom, Sarah...

126
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,486
Is a medal...

127
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,881
A badge of honour...

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,413
Make it your crown jewel and you won't grieve. Ever.

129
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:07,590
On the frontlines, you die once...

130
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,240
On the home front, we die everyday...

131
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,054
Being alive, yet not quite, like this... Turns any honour or medal into helplessness... And grief...

132
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,444
Anyway...

133
00:06:19,444 --> 00:06:21,365
I'm glad...

134
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,996
Why?

135
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,892
You didn't reject me for someone else...

136
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,280
Who knows...

137
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,111
You may not have to worry about this tomorrow!

138
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,146
Cüneyt...

139
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,276
Anyway, forget it...

140
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:48,044
I think...

141
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,190
We ought to start off as neighbours...

142
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,400
And good friends...

143
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,456
We're home.

144
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,860
Bye.

145
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,826
See you soon.

146
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,646
He's nice...

147
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:05,820
Pleasant... Gentlemanly...

148
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,170
Grandpa and Granny have been cruel to him... And his family...

149
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,703
Why'd you reject his proposal then?

150
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:16,288
Told you, I ain't marrying a soldier.

151
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:20,308
You promised me you ain't joining the Army either.

152
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,121
Aye... Just pray...

153
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:29,241
What d'you mean? I've been praying for you all day. When d'you get your result?

154
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,851
You'll ace it, I tell you!

155
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,591
Soon...

156
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,096
Do -- D'you see him everyday? In the park?
-Aye.

157
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:43,155
We go for a stroll everyday... But we don't really talk much...

158
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,900
Mostly exchange 'Hi's... That's all...

159
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,235
Why?

160
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,850
You mind it?

161
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,325
N -- No -- Of course not...

162
00:07:52,325 --> 00:07:54,863
Why'd I mind it?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,330
You said he's pleasant...

164
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,270
Nice...

165
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,346
Cares for you...

166
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,012
Why'd I mind it...

167
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,402
If he's so nice?

168
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,180
By the way, you said you were worried. What is it?

169
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,444
It's sorted out.

170
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,909
How?

171
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,282
Just... Sorted out.

172
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,540
Bless yer... Yer luk nice... Young, if Oi may say so...

173
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,090
'Young' is stretchin' it...

174
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,825
The grub dees days... It takes a toll on yer...

175
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,430
Aye, roi...

176
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,690
All our lives, we've done everythin' ter take care av Mamai, Da, brothers, an' each other...

177
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,432
Dad used ter walk two miles every mornin'.

178
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,683
All 'is life.

179
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,000
But me...

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,320
My joints craic an' pop an' 'urt al' de time.

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,461
Have sum marmalade. It'll ease de pain.

182
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,179
Really?

183
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,674
Always worked for us.

184
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:15,410
We make lashings av marmalade! An' 'av it loike afters!

185
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,648
I'll ask Vishal ter git sum...

186
00:09:18,648 --> 00:09:22,929
Not sure if we can git sum good marmalade the-day though...

187
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,420
Did Vishal git into university?

188
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,285
Aye.

189
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,840
We're waitin' for 'is result...

190
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,921
But oi'm confident 'e'll ace it.

191
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,440
Vishal...

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,130
Is jist loike Vijay...

193
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,460
Vijay never failed an exam. Ever.

194
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,002
Just loike Sherali.

195
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,865
He did everythin' on 'is own...

196
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:55,331
We barely knew aboyt 'is exams an' al'...

197
00:09:56,331 --> 00:10:01,286
He'd tell us... Whaen 'e'd git 'is result...

198
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:04,363
They say boys are a 'assle...

199
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:07,740
You nade ter keep an mince pie on dem...

200
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,001
But Vijay wus never a 'assle...

201
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,140
Sherali...

202
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,961
Always listened ter me...

203
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,511
Ever since 'e lef us... We've been... Uneasy... Troubled...

204
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:24,414
Aye...

205
00:10:25,553 --> 00:10:30,553
Our kids are who we live for...
-Absolutely...

206
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,748
'E's de only wan oi 'ad...

207
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,867
My son-in-law is so greedy... So greedy...

208
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:41,040
God forgive 'im...

209
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,160
I canny even tell yer waaat a 'assle 'e's been after Vijay's death!

210
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,860
Gud Lord...

211
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,020
I can understan'...

212
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:59,350
We've done everythin' for our kids al' our lives... But we've got nathin'... Naw wan...

213
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,575
An' ter tink... We wouldn't be cryin' loike dis...

214
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,822
For our lost sons...

215
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:09,700
If our nashuns did not fight dees bleedin wars al' de bleedin time!

216
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,197
War killed dem... An' us...

217
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,999
Aye...

218
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,857
Why'd you have to talk about any of this?

219
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,953
Couldn't you talk about something good?

220
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,296
You're crying too...

221
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,545
You're making her cry too...

222
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,466
Mrs Malhotra...

223
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,580
Please...

224
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,229
Talk all you want about Kathiya Wala Bazaar... Or the woods of Amritsar...

225
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:02,490
Or the river Jhelum...

226
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,220
But...

227
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,540
Let's not talk...

228
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,050
About those we've buried...

229
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,670
And those...

230
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,260
You've cremated...

231
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,944
Hey.

232
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:33,188
Hey.

233
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:36,818
You stopped coming here in the morning because of me!

234
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:41,504
No... I just ain't that regular... I come here when I feel like...

235
00:12:41,504 --> 00:12:47,082
It's quite reassuring, you know... That it's not because of me...

236
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,162
Anyway...

237
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,723
This is for you.

238
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,494
What's this?
-A stethoscope keychain. Caught my eye in a shop, I thought I'd get it for you.

239
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:03,715
A stethoscope keychain. Caught my eye in a shop, I thought I'd get it for you.

240
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,922
Wonder what'd you like. A gun keychain?

241
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,604
No.

242
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,831
One like the Victoria Cross would do.

243
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,902
Ma'am...
-Hmm?

244
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,656
Got this letter.
-Who sent it?

245
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:43,652
No idea.

246
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,789
Thank you.

247
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,142
What's this?

248
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,980
You're not joining the Army!

249
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,056
I don't have a choice, Mum...

250
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:34,377
You lied to me?

251
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:36,600
You dare lie to me?

252
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,086
Mum...

253
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,410
You sat the exam, cleared your medical check-up, and you didn't even tell me!

254
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,184
Your Granny knew this...

255
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,367
Your Granny knew this, didn't she?

256
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,195
Your Granny knew this, didn't she?
-Aye...

257
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,274
You're her grandson... But my son!

258
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,690
I've got no one else...

259
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,860
She's got no one else too...

260
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,476
What d'you want?

261
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,043
D'you want me to end up like her one day?

262
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:13,699
Yeah?

263
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,239
I can give you everything...

264
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:23,501
I can give you the security you were looking for...

265
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,283
I can't lose my son...

266
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:29,557
For some security...

267
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:34,907
I turned that proposal down... Because you promised me...

268
00:15:34,907 --> 00:15:40,552
And -- I will keep it, Mum... I can fix everything, Mum...

269
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:43,798
In that case, don't join the Army.

270
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:46,226
I can't live without you, Vishal...

271
00:15:46,226 --> 00:15:47,534
Mum...

272
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:53,792
Who says I'll end up like Dad? Millions join the Army... Not all of them get killed in action.

273
00:15:53,792 --> 00:15:57,415
The only one who ever mattered was from our family...

274
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,992
The widow he left behind was your Mum...

275
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,337
The orphan... You!

276
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,153
Are you seriously telling me that not everyone ends up like that?

277
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:09,923
How are you so sure it won't be you?

278
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,255
Please, Mum... Please!

279
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,917
Vishal...

280
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:18,845
I did...

281
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,512
Just as you said...

282
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,112
You've got to listen to me this time!
-No...

283
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:28,855
I've always done as you said... Always will...

284
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,013
But... This is something...

285
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,739
I've chosen for myself...

286
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,105
If we want to live...

287
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:42,024
We must live with honour.

288
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,850
And honour...

289
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,908
In this part of the world...

290
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,992
Means power...

291
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,620
Then -- Join the bureaucracy -- The Civil Service or something...

292
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,455
I need the power that comes with a uniform!

293
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,886
A uniform that makes lions of men...

294
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,376
That all? Your reason?

295
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,791
Is that all the Army is to you? Seriously?

296
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,690
The only thing Vijay...

297
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,940
And your Grandpa cared about...

298
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,570
When they joined the Army...

299
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,501
Was the nation... They loved it with their lives...

300
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,588
They honoured their vows to the nation in death...

301
00:17:25,588 --> 00:17:28,940
I don't have just one reason.

302
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,579
I've got many more.

303
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,955
No, Vishal! No!

304
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,415
Mum...

305
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,118
Why'd you have to betray me?

306
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,359
I did everything...

307
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,355
For the honour of the family...

308
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:20,122
How much more blood will it take to satiate this 'honour' of yours?

309
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,199
What d'you want?

310
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,028
D'you want me to go through everything you're going through?

311
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,880
I've lost my husband...

312
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,911
My world...

313
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:39,043
My life, as I knew it...

314
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:41,558
Was gone...

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,253
You want something to happen to Vishal... So I'm gone for good!
-God forbid...

316
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,350
Don't say it...

317
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,001
What's it matter?

318
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:58,852
If something happened to him... Sunanda won't be able to live without him...

319
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:04,612
Please... Stop him, Mum... I beg you...

320
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,459
Please...

321
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,719
Stop him...

322
00:19:10,704 --> 00:19:14,450
He's not just my son...

323
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,635
He's your grandson too...

324
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:21,970
He's Vijay's son... Vijay lives on through him...

325
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,765
Please... Stop him... I can't live without Vishal... Please...

326
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,851
Please...

327
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:32,102
Stop him...

328
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,912
He's all we've got left... We can't lose him...

329
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,130
Granny!

330
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,620
Where's Nawab?

331
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,467
Getting the groceries...

332
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:53,622
He didn't leave anything for me... I'm knackered... And starving!

333
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:57,305
He made some kebabs... Let me have a look...

334
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,281
Jesus, it's right here, in front of you!

335
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,460
You don't see anything, do you?

336
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,686
Not when I'm hungry...

337
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,947
Vishal got into university...

338
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,295
Who told you?

339
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:27,413
Vishal's Granny. We talked yesterday.

340
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,976
I'll ask him...

341
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,020
He didn't even tell me!

342
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,477
Hey! Don't forget to send him some sweets!

343
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:39,949
We'll be even.

344
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,992
Just a sec.

345
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,550
Hello?

346
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,906
Way to go, mate.

347
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:58,626
What is it?

348
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,354
What d'you mean?

349
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:05,352
You got your result. Got selected. But you didn't even tell me!

350
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:06,781
Who told you?

351
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:10,782
Your Granny told my Granny, of course.

352
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,515
What?

353
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:25,544
Don't take me for a ride. You got into engineering college and you didn't even bother to tell me!

354
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:29,610
Just found out today...
-You're so mean...

355
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,257
You always come to me for prayers... I'm sure you've told Neha already though.

356
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,607
Jesus, however did you think of her?
-Just did...

357
00:21:40,902 --> 00:21:42,841
I didn't like it...

358
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:44,996
But I'm not angry.

359
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,550
Congratulations.

360
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,776
You can hack into my computer now.

361
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,001
That's the most I can do...

362
00:21:54,001 --> 00:21:56,157
You don't sound too happy...

363
00:21:56,157 --> 00:22:00,234
Didn't you get into the university of your choice?

364
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,992
No...

365
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,102
Well... That explains the silence...

366
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:08,351
Anyway...

367
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:15,709
Big deal... Once you're done... Go for a Masters... You're so bright. What've you got to worry about?

368
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,971
Misfortune...

369
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:22,259
Why are you so upset? Is it that bad? The uni you got into.

370
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,231
Which uni did you get into, by the way?

371
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,218
Forget it... I've compromised...

372
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,751
It's always good, innit? To compromise...

373
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,428
You asking me or telling me?

374
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:39,485
How 'bout both?

375
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,002
Why are you upset if you've compromised?

376
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,973
It's gonna be good for you.

377
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,103
Good for me...

378
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,099
Aye...

379
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,336
Where's Mum?

380
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,431
In her room...

381
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,870
She hasn't had anything...

382
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,030
Don't worry... She will...

383
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,454
Hello?

384
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:11,625
Your new number, is it, Vishal?

385
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,991
I'm his mother...

386
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:16,384
Oh... Aunt...

387
00:25:16,477 --> 00:25:18,510
Everything alright?

388
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,616
For now...

389
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:23,274
Can't be so sure about tomorrow...

390
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:26,960
What d'yo -- Vishal's okay, right?

391
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,732
I...

392
00:25:31,732 --> 00:25:33,999
I need your help...

393
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,240
I'm all ears...

394
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,334
I'll do what I can...

395
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:44,560
Right now, you're the only one who can stop Vishal from joining the Army...

396
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,030
Please... Stop him...

397
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,210
What? He's joining the Army?

398
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,351
No -- He got into Engineering... Didn't he?

399
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,010
Who told you?
-He and his Granny.

400
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,368
They lied to you.

401
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:02,750
He's been selected in the Army.

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
