00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,574
<i>Every promise, every vow, every oath,</i>

2
00:00:18,574 --> 00:00:25,354
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

3
00:00:25,354 --> 00:00:29,454
<i>Heart and soul mine, cry both,</i>

4
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>In this life, trapped...</i>

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,327
<i>I'm whiling away sleepless nights</i>

6
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>And restless days,</i>

7
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,630
<i>Searching for you in the dark anights,</i>

8
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,241
<i>Hoping to see you through the haze...</i>

9
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,450
<i>Who's gonna stop these tears from falling?</i>

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,161
<i>There's just this wall,</i>

11
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:57,236
<i>Just this wall,</i>

12
00:00:57,236 --> 00:00:58,670
<i>That's betwixt us,</i>

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,320
<i>That's betwixt us, standing tall...</i>

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,060
<i>There's just this wall,</i>

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>Just this wall,</i>

16
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>That's betwixt us,</i>

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,605
<i>That's betwixt us, standing tall...</i>

18
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,990
<i>That's betwixt us,</i>

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>That's betwixt us, standing tall...</i>

Episode 10 - 'Blurred Borders'

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd you get back?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two weeks ago?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how's the family?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of my life... I got divorced...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? But Shilpa was so nice!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, the women are always nice... We're the nasty ones...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Raj... You haven't changed one bit from your college days, have you?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you remember those days?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't forget them...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've made it through all these years thanks to the memories...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know about Vijay...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's always been deployed in conflict zones...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I used to tease you for it... Vijay's been cruel to me... Claimed you for himself...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But honestly...

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really feel sad for you... You made a great couple...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was my world...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I miss him every living moment...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can understand...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's Vishal?
-Great. He's doing his A-Levels...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last year of school... About time he started planning things...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really? I thought he'd be sitting for GCSEs this year...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your daughters?
-They're just eight...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your son -- What's his name?
-Vipin.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, right... How's he?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's with Shilpa... I talk to him now and then... Talk to her too...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bitter divorce...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bitter divorce?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had an affair, and it wasn't easy for me, but I asked for it myself...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's remarried now...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... I'm sure it hurts...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She hit me where it hurts...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vipin left for University... And I got transferred back to India...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't stay anywhere long.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just trying to reconnect with old friends since I got here...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just trying to cope with my depression, you could say...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was a heartbreak... But not as big as when Vijay made you his.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Raj...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunanda...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if I proposed to you again?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the only one who can help...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't have had to ask you if Sherali were here...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how much he loved me...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need some time to think... But don't worry... I'll do something...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the only one I've got now, Amna...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I'll get back to you, okay?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give my regards to Mum and Dad... Tell the kids I said hi.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was it?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Ayesha...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it this time?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her husband's suffered a big loss...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was asking if we could lend her... 6 or 7 million-ish...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>6 or 7 million-ish?</i>

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how? And why is she asking you?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's found out about the compensation for your Dad's death...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you turned her down.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said... I need some time...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need time?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember everything she said when she left! But now, she has the guts to ask for our 'help'!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost count how many times Dad's lent Uncle something... Has he ever returned a penny?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know... But I can't just turn her down like that...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how much your Dad loved her.
-He did...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But did she love us?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she did, she'd know we've got no source of income...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd know we can't give away everything we've got left like that.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, but I can't say it to her face...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said I'll talk to your Grandpa.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be happy to help his dearest daughters...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who doesn't love his daughters?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neha is Anurag's niece. She wanted to visit India, so I thought I'd bring her along. Yeah?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's turn up the music, shall we? Unless... You don't like it?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That beauty is none but my sweetheart!</i>

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, that's some horrible traffic!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, it ain't nothing like Canada!

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa! Are you okay? You sure you don't want that seat belt?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, sorry, I just forgot...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get used to forgetting in this part of the world...
-Okay...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called Zafar Mehmood too...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not sure if he told Ayesha, but...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He told me if he didn't get the money...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd lose his property...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tried to explain it to him...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he thinks I've struck gold or something.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What do we do?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got the compensation...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we've got duties...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been asking for a few months... I'm sure he'll pay us back...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if he didn't?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can't ask for it...

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've borrowed from Sherali before...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, from their brother...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they've got to return it to his wife.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They know what's going on in your life...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... As you say...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never have said it if it were not my own daughter...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know her in-laws very well...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, thanks to your daughter and son-in-law... I can't even look my daughter-in-law in the eye.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Parbhu...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long are you staying here?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're asking that the day I'm here.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Naw...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Thinking...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you've -- Got other things to take care of, yes?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granny... I'm here because I wanted to see every place in India I can, and Aunt told me Vishal's gonna show me!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vishal?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. Once he's done with his exams, why not?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've made a list.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shopping, tourist attractions, and then there's this concert... So many things to do!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neha's a lovely girl... Very friendly and fun-loving. She's just started college, by the way.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow. What are you studying?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Art and theatre, but I've got a thing for music too.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vishal's got a thing for music too. He's quite the singer himself!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you told me... You've told me a lot about him...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, this is delicious!
-Have some more!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to... Talk to Sarah's Mum, remember?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not now, Vishal... Not in front of Pratibha!

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's gonna find out... Say things about you and me...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you've got to say sorry to them.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will!
-Just do it!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually -- It's a bit embarrassing for me too...
-Don't you care too much for them?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just needed a drink.
-It's in the fridge...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, not this one...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess this will do!

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've mixed your coursebooks with Dad's books...

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We shouldn't be lending anything to Aunt. You're making a big mistake.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to work, Sarah... Don't get on my wick...

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not a kid anymore... I can tell you what I think...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vishal says you're making a mistake too.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you need to tell him about everything?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you need to tell him about everything in our lives?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's our problem, aye... But you're making a big mistake... Mark my words, they're not gonna return a penny!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't turn your Granny and Grandpa down like that.
-They're just thinking of their daughters.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do they want our money? D'you think they'd give us a penny if we needed anything?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sarah's right...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't need to give Ayesha and Zafar a penny...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all for Sherali's family...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His kids...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! Wait!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up the kids, and stop listening to a mature voice of reason! What's next?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you all day?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Too busy...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly knackered...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Your Aunt back?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... How d'you know?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just do...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's your Aunt...

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then there's mine...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always something going on... Wonder why we don't empower our women so they don't get blackmailed by their in-laws into blackmailing their families.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls are natural blackmailers...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you not typecast or be so chauvinistic for a change? Like, haven't you got your Granny, your Mum or your sisters?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for including Granny there... 'Mum and sisters' sounds so stereotypical... Like they all say?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm anything but stereotypical... Not me, not my life...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, nothing... The same old...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's blackmailing Mum... Grandpa and Granny haven't had anything all day... And I'm the black sheep here! No one wants to talk to me!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever happens, don't give them a penny. Make it clear to your Mum, okay?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I think Mum's gonna give up... She won't take up arms against them...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't she a soldier's wife?
-She is...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wives ain't nearly as used to fighting... Even soldiers' wives... They're only taught to compromise...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about you?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to be strong.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not helpless, cowardly, and dependent.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're outta luck, mate... In Pakistan, at least.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if it's any different in India. Don't act like you folks don't want doormats for wives.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hardly different.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now... Don't embarrass me like that...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Mum didn't call Mum...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will... She's got her number... Tell her to take her call, okay?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's talked to a colleague... May be able to help find someone in Pakistan...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm positively knackered... Need some rest.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Good night...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you said good night in a second.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You amaze me...
-How?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you needed some rest. So I said good night. What's wrong?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hung up...

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's everyone?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grandpa? Granny? Mum?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sarah!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?
-Mum!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elena called! Just got my result!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?
-Straight A*s!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Best in the school!
-Congratulations!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell Granny and Grandpa?
-Nope. Wanted to tell you first.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well done, Sarah.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what! Straight A*s in her A-Levels!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations! When'd you get your result?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just now!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sherali always wanted you to be a doctor...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know...

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm working on making his dream a reality.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell your Granny yet?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!
-Mum!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sofia!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum... I need to get some dresses stitched... Who's your tailor?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same old...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you go with Vishal tomorrow?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vishal's taking Neha shopping...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I ain't going to a mall or something...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congrats, Doc!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slow down, it's my A-Level result.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doc's gonna need a few years...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the first step.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank God...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was Dad's one dream...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He used to call me 'Doc' like you too...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, you off to a hostel or something?
-No.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll apply to a medical college in my city...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had to change my plans...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't leave my family all alone here...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I understand...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congrats anyway. When are you sending me sweets?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Buy what you like and enjoy yourself.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't exchange sweets here... Except our soldiers on the border...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And our Prime Ministers when they meet...

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about you change things? Send some sweets here and... Start a trend, maybe?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sending 'em's gonna cost more than the sweets themselves. So, have what you like... And send me, perhaps?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about my money?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When d'you care about money? You ain't a Scrooge like me, are you?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, mate...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gotta go back...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have dinner...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Vishal's mother. Sunanda.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you Sarah's mother?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's me.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... You wanted to talk to me?
-So... You wanted to talk to me?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what to say...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vishal's Granny... The other day...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything she said...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry about everything...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really sorry...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry too... If anything my in-laws said... Hurt you...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how their generation thinks...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What d'you want me to call you?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amna?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uh...

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, that's good...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or Mrs Sherali...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our wounds would bleed every time we called each other...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mrs Sherli and Mrs Vijay Malhotra...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Amna and Sunanda...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May be able to pour their hearts out to each other...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's right...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suninda...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunanda...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunenda...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry too much about Nadir, okay?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's got a learning disability, he can overcome it...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've worked with SEND kids before...

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my only son...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want him...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To be like his father...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to tell my world about our problems...

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understand...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure you can find help in Pakistan...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone who can show you the way...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... You've always got me...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to talk to me about anything you need...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a job...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a housewife...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a lot that's easy for you...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I can't even imagine...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like I run the world... I'm a third world woman... Just like you...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a lot I can only imagine... But never do...

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, Vishal said Sarah got into medical college?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot to congratulate you...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're grieving again today...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It would've been such a happy day...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If her Dad were with us...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can understand...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the same here...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good news brings us to tears...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, as they say, life's gotta go on...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ups and downs...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was he your love?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My parents' choice...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about you?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vijay took up arms against the whole world to marry me...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We came from different classes, different ends of the country... But his love was blind to it all...

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was poet too...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He lost his heart to me when we met at a competition...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lost my heart to him... When I heard his poetry...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea why I'm telling you any of it...

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay... I don't mind it...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was my parents' choice...

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So to speak...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now that he's gone...

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It feels like I've lost the love of my life...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God, he's spoilt me so much...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been handicapped...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever since he's gone...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got everything, so to speak...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
An estate, kids, my in-laws...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's this emptiness... That's swallowed them all...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't had a good night's sleep ever since...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This bed... In my room... It's never seen him... Felt him...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't talk to anyone...

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one will understand...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vijay never liked me in white...

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now... All I've got is white... It's all I can wear...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I walk past his picture in white, I feel like he's giving me that look...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feeling sad for me...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are things a wife only shares with her husband...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just loved to snuggle with him...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Being close to him...

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt safe from the world...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Noria and Nadir snuggle with me...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't got the strength to be their Sherali...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get chills in my feet in the winter...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vijay would warm them with his feet when he'd be here...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His hands, his feet... They were always so warm...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were my fireplace...

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now...

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My fire's been extinguished...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say he died a hero's death...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I ask why he left me...

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what they tell me too...

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You should be proud'...

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You should be proud'...
<i>Every promise, every vow, every oath,</i>

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder...
<i>Every promise, every vow, every oath,</i>

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder...
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what?
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost my husband...
<i>Everything just snapped...</i>

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost my husband...

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My other half...

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No medal can ever complete me again...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Heart and soul mine, cry both,</i>

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In this life, trapped...</i>

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'm whiling away sleepless nights</i>

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And restless days,</i>

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Searching for you in the dark anights,</i>

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Hoping to see you through the haze...</i>

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who's gonna stop these tears from falling?</i>

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From where?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
India.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it... It's for your result.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe it's gotten to a point where they're exchanging sweets!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can never be yours! I hope you're clear about that!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can never be yours! I hope you're clear about that!
-Of course...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course... It's not like I love her or something... It's just -- Plain impossible!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
