1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,038
Nor family, nor kin...

2
00:00:03,038 --> 00:00:05,670
Grieving together, broken within...

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,280
I'm

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,998
I'm Sarah.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,628
They know me as a fallen hero's daughter.

6
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:17,557
But there's someone who can look through that pride...

7
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:19,829
And see a familiar pain...

8
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:21,000
Sarah?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,738
Alright?

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,528
Just missing Dad...

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:28,320
He's our enemy...

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,261
But he knows me better than everyone else.

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,067
Strange, innit?

14
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,750
Well... I'd rather let you guys decide that.
