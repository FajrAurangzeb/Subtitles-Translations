Right now, you're the only one who can stop Vishal from joining the Army...

00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:32,600
Please... Stop him...

What? He's joining the Army?

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,960
No -- He got into Engineering... Didn't he?

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,426
Who told you?
-He and his Granny.

They lied to you.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,684
He's been selected in the Army.

It's my helplessness...

63
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,762
My country forced me into this...

64
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:27,461
My family - four women who look up to me, who I can't protect, can't do anything for... They forced me...

65
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:32,399
I'm a woman too... I've got women in my family too... I've never been so helpless...

00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,443
And you?

69
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:42,321
You're not weak...

70
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,899

You're a funk!

73
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,490
You're too much of a funk to fight...

74
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,075
And?

75
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,071

103

105

You don't need to say anything.

106
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,600

107
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,531
I've got a long road ahead of me...

108

Let's just say someone...

111
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,011
Helped me decide...

112
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,269
Who?

113
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,724
A friend.

114
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,324
My deepest thanks to your 'friend'!

115
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,796
It's okay...

116
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
You won't regret making this decision...

117
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,496
You have my word.

118
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,072
It's a soldier's oath...

119
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:37,538

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,494
Vishal's fine now, Dr Sunanda.

121
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:59,855
He just had a nervous breakdown... Of sorts...

122
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,933
He's stressed.

123
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,544
But don't worry.

124
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,376
He's alright now.

125
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:11,171
You can take him home tomorrow.

00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,952

-Welcome, Dr Sunanda.

127
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,950
Yer nu waaat 'e's stressed aboyt...

128

Don't yer?

129
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,096
I'm so sorry, Vishal...

130
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,179
For what?

131
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:55,526
For stopping you from joining the Army...

132
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:58,197
Pressuring you...

133
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,410
I won't stop you.

134
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,208
I'll be happy with what you want...

135
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:11,004
Do whatever you want... Just -- Don't be like this...

136
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:25,501
C'mon, we're neighbours...

137
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:29,250
We live next to each other.

138
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,320
She won't have any problem visiting you...

139
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,861
Our place's been so lonely after Meliha got married...

140
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:43,650
Cüneyt ain't around too... We'd like his wife to give us some company...

141
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,283
Sarah's just started college...

142
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:49,678
I'm not sure she can manage both her studies and household chores...

143
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:52,501
Kids know these days...

144
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:56,742
Meliha's been doing both her jobs just fine!

145
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:02,617
You don't need to worry about Sarah's studies. We'll take care of everything.

146
00:18:02,617 --> 00:18:06,412
Totally agreed with you...

147
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,470
Your choice...

148
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,339
She's all yours...

149
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:18,320
She can go to your place anyday you pick.

150
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,892
On that note, how 'bout some sweets?

151
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:25,339
Sure. Why not?

152
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:29,198
Amna... Get us some sweets. And a nice cuppa.

153
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:34,827
Congratulations!
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.
-Thanks!

154
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,911
God protect you...

155
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,123
Take care, okay?

156
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,003
Got everything you need?
-'Course.

157
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,576
Bye...

158
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,601
Bye.

159
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,323
They want to get you two married as soon as possible.

160
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:59,020
You're engaged already...

161
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,856
We'd have a man in the family...

162
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:05,377

163
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,144
He may be able to protect us...

164
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,397
No one's been able to fill the void...

165
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:16,662
Your Dad left in our lives...

166
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,524
Perhaps Cüneyt...?

167
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,868
Do what you see fit...

168
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,031
I have no problem with it.

169
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,803
Sarah!!

170
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,663
I couldn't keep my word and enlisted in the Army.....

171
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:09,838
I'm very sorry....

172
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:13,418
Could you.... Forgive my first lie....?

173
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:15,183
Vishal.

174
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,340
The weather's changing...

175
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,971
What do we do with the plants outside?

176
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,940
Remind me in the morning, okay?

177
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,155
For now, could you wash these dishes?

178
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,190
Sarah!

179
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,005
Love...

180
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,886
Could I talk to Vishal's Granny?

181
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,330
Why?

182
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,635
Aren't they invited to your wedding?

183
00:23:08,216 --> 00:23:13,960
What are you saying? Why in the world would we invite them?

184
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,667
Why not? We're exchanging sweets already, what's the big deal?

185
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,916
It's not like they're actually gonna come!

186
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,291
Sorry Oi 'enny talked ter yer in a while...

Be the 'oly, that's gran'...

202
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:18,685
Congratulashuns!

203
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:24,420
Wonder why Vishal never towl me...
-What? He didn't?

204
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,692
I'm sure he jist forgot...

205
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:30,426
Anyway... We didn't... You're invited!

206
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:34,770
No way Oi'm takin' a 'no'... Yer gotta cum see Pakistan!

207
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,807
Sure...

208
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:41,227
I've alwus wanted ter visit Pakistan...

209
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,993
I'll talk ter Sunanda an' Vishal aboyt it...

210
00:24:44,993 --> 00:24:46,780
By de way...

211
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,609
Who's 'e? 'Er man.

212
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,695
The neighbour's lad.

213
00:24:51,695 --> 00:24:53,720
A Captain, naw less!

214
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,008
A gran' fella. Upright. Simple.

215
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,553
Okay, that's enough...
-Have some more. Yeah, finish it...

216
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:11,380
Blimey, you look so weak...

217
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,863
The Army ain't no joke...

218
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,260
Know what...

219
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,068
I could barely recognise Vijay when he came back from the Academy...

220
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:28,412
He'd lost 10 kgs!

221
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:34,600
Not me... I mean -- Barely had any weight to begin with... Nothin' to lose...

222
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,897
I miss you so much... Why don't you call us?

223
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:42,562
Between studying and getting some rest... I barely get the time...

224
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:45,452
I'm not on my phone all day now...

225
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,434
Aye...

226
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:54,097
No other way he could miss finding out about Sarah's wedding, yes?

227
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,910
Sarah...

228
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,868
Sarah's wedding?

229
00:26:02,868 --> 00:26:04,463
Aye...

230
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,310
She's gotten engaged...

231
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:14,763
Didn't she tell you? Oh wait... You don't get to call <i>her</i> either, do you?

232
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,908
Speakin' av whaich...

233
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:20,960
Cos they've invited us...

234
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,004
Why don't we send a gift or somethin'?

235
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,432
Yeah?

236
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,811
What happened?

237
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,990
Was it something I said?

238
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,641
Hello?

239
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,463
Hello...

240
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,150
Getting married?

241
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,766
Yeah...

242
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,626
Congratulations...

243
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,565
You didn't tell me...

244
00:27:28,835 --> 00:27:30,605
Thank you...

245
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,754
You know everything about me...

246
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,540
You found this out too...

247
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:43,490
You didn't want me to join the Army... But now, you've gotten engaged to a soldier...

248
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,676
You started it...

249
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:48,838
And I know you're gonna end it...

250
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,868
How's the training?

251
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:53,998
Oh, just the usual...

252
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,036
My life, though... Not so much...

253
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,576
You could wait until you graduated, you know?

254
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,967
And?

255
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,258
What's the difference?

256
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,540
I would've married Cüneyt...

257
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,010
Either way...

258
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,170
I...

259
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,326
Told him about you...

260
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,514
What'd you tell him?

261
00:28:29,983 --> 00:28:31,778
I said...

262
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:33,790
I've got a friend...

263
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,100
On the other side...

264
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,080
That makes me his enemy.

265
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,901
That's what he said, too...

266
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,276
He was kidding...

267
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:47,133
I'm not.

268
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:50,940
You won't be fighting all day, every day...

269
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,582
Right...?

270
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,556
After you're married...

271
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,830
We won't be able to talk to each other...

272
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,091
We won't be able to talk to each other...
-Aye...

273
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:01,496
Aye...

274
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,682
We won't...

275
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:07,255
Like we couldn't all these months...

276
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,257
You were busy...

277
00:29:10,257 --> 00:29:12,956
Now, it's my turn...

278
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,920
That's it about life...

279
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,761
Always something... Someone...

280
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,968
Like Cüneyt between us right now?

281
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,031
We had a border between us...

282
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,923
A wall of thorns...

283
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,131

284
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,342
