1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call the doctor! Maheen's not --

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up, Mum?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Maheen...)

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Maheen?)

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Maheen...)

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you nick just now?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You complete blighter!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just droppin' by to say hi.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you were sleeping as if you've got everything.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the time?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost midnight.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You alright?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Course. That's why I was sleeping so peacefully.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls... Blimey...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're getting what they've always wanted,

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And they sleep without a care!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The doctor gave me a few meds after the bullet incident.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're a lot better at doing their job.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why are you here so late?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Felt like comin'?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd sit with you a while... Have a chat...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd ease me.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You worried?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just found out yesterday

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Mum

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was innocent all along.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad's shaken.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashamed at everything he did.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What good is it?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She died a grieving woman.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not entirely Dad's fault though.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will... Someday...

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For now, I'm... Looking for him...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll settle all scores.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you said he died with your Mum in the car crash?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he did, aye...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But his kids...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta pay...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the sins of their father...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not fair, Jiya.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's their fault?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blighter's dead.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can do anything you want and he won't even stir in his grave.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know, but he will...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know his soul's lurking around here somewhere...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a good night's sleep...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you have a cuppa?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need a cuppa to stay awake now.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd you get in?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a while ago?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry I didn't call...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Wanted to see her.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're done so quickly!

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's turned in!

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you have anything?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next time?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got old ties to this place...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll come knocking like I have a right...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi partner!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme guess. She didn't take your call, so you thought you'd ask Fajr.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, mate...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Worry not though

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The conditions have become completely concordant. Restrictions have been lifted.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can meet her easily.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of which, why don't you two ever meet?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I find it a sight to behold to see two lovers meet!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even you think I love her.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always known it.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She realised it a tad late.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I confide in you?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But promise me it will stay between us.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It will; you don't need my word for it.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't love her.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ohhh!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just teasing her.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She used to be so proud of herself,

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look how I've shattered her ego!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your ego that's been shattered.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Springing off into the sky like that!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not joking, Fajr...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not joking either.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understand love better than both of you. Combined.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I feel guilty.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with it.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep feeling guilty for the rest of your life.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr, I'm so ashamed of myself and you don't even get it...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- Her calling me and my turning back doesn't mean we love each other.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think -- our quarrel's been resolved.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you even know that she refused to wear the engagement ring?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such silliness.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What made her act so foolishly and unashamedly?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trapped me with herself.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trapped?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's thinking we've got something going on.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm almost dying of shame.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I even begin to tell you I'd never even imagined I'd marry a country girl!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you to lie like that?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was lying back then.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now I'm telling the truth.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
100%.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon reflection...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I realized that I shouldn't have flirted with her.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After all, she's my cousin, mate.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Aunt's daughter.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm so stupid.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ended up making a mistake.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse your filthy mouth!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd all curse me if you ever found out.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But... Could you not say that?</i>

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you going back?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're blowing the gaff on yourself and staying here?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go, mate. In a few days.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, I'll apologise to her.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Today itself.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then don't tarry. You've got your chance.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's still awake.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its maker, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Where do these turns come from</i>

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Where do these turns come from</i>

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us</i>

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Are the ones who break our heart</i>

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us</i>

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Are the ones who break our heart</i>

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Where do these turns come from</i>

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us</i>

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Are the ones who break our heart</i>

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us</i>

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Are the ones who break our heart</i>

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's got a knack for catching me red-handed.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd turned in.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or Wali will get up too.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He sent me.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He asked me to see what you're up to.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Were it so easy...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These flames burnt your letters. A different flame's searing the two of us.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does every lover get his love?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Yes?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hardly any different with me.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't get her.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll settle for someone else.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you collect these ashes, then?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd scatter them in the sea tomorrow.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I find you a match?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find me a second match.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or it'll sound so weird.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find a good one.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Not better than her.</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your cuppa!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head? It's midnight!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How will I doze off?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I want. Have it and open your eyes.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just an excuse...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got news that will keep you awake.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a sip.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a sip first.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, breaking news.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Romeo from London is smitten with you.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you surprised?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better be.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ain't all.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear it is.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just telling it my way.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to explain?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He called me a while back.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he doesn't love you

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And was just flirting.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, he asked me

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I thought he could ever fall for a country girl.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses and let me finish!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cool down and think about it carefully.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's coming here to say sorry.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For when he, with his head in Nano's lap, said he loved you.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon reflection, he figured

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was cursing you.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said refusing the ring was a big mistake.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You earned him a bad name.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's coming to say sorry for that?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what he said.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you take that quietly?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't! I cursed his filthy mouth!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you curse him with death already?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast! Not before you know who made him say it!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I wasn't angry.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He felt... Like someone so close...

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
English roses? He's just teasing you!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know he's so desi [Asian] as to sacrifice his love for Gulrez!

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum must've said something about the family's honour...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He grabbed his chance to play Romeo.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His type can be found singing at their beloved's weddings. Exempli gratia...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This lambent, sightly procession</i>

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>To whom do I present this?</i>

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This magnificent --</i>

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wh --?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slap him the moment you see him!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, it's just fair to rip his face apart!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Ammi Begum.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you as well.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the lad?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slouching about in his room.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not humouring him.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd she go then?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At this hour?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's half past midnight!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She left in a fit of rage!

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call and ask her.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>D'you seriously think she'd be angry with him?</i>

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I called her. Her phone's in her room.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd she go?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Fajr.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked her.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said, 'You're gonna tell Ammi Begum if I told you'.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all in it together!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I've got my answer...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back once I'm through with her.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wee Maheen.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Dastoor and Mehru?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's half past midnight! I'm sure they turned in!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did I ask you the time?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed. Where is he?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone seems to have forgotten all her manners!

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you seriously think I'd know where to find a wastrel like that rotter?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rouse Dastoor.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not the day after. I got to leave tomorrow.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you in a sec. Bye.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard you called Fajr.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything you told her?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be embarrassed.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You tell everyone?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've roused him.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay right here.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Tell everyone right now!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold it.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let 'em sort it out.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that, Nano...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is no longer just between us.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you tell 'em everything?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say those fiery words

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And shatter my ego for Nano to see!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look like a man, Waqar Ahmed.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show 'em you are one for real.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would hate to poke my nose where it doesn't belong,

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But care to tell me

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What this row at my place is all about?</i>

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, hero?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell 'em and win their hearts.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at her

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shamelessly prattling on and on and on...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want to tell them?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair 'nuff...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell 'em myself...

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember how you all thought

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's fallen for me?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were mighty mistaken.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was just flirting.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon reflection... He felt ashamed...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could he flirt with his Aunt's girl?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you told Fajr, right?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That's what you told Fajr, right?
What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you were serious about that.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me you always will be.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You'd do well to remember it, Waqar Ahmed -
For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When it's about her ego, Maheen Aurangzeb can be far more ruthless than you can ever imagine.
For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When it's about her ego, Maheen Aurangzeb can be far more ruthless than you can ever imagine.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll finish you off

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where you won't get an ounce of relief.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor Gulrez!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you said

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't love Maheen?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you were just taking her for a ride?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slap some sense into him, will you?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's lying.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I don't love her'!

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you check if he's in his room or made a run for it?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's sleeping.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who sleep peacefully after hearing all sorts of insults have no honour.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not sleeping.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's put his honour to sleep.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Ammi Begum.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd mind it if I said something.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to say it.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Willy-nilly.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, say it or she's gonna be furious.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, Dastoor Ahmed...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Tell me...

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's he putting his honour to sleep?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves you a lot.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After falling for Maheen,

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He feels your word and the family's honour [Waqar] are at stake.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's thinking of fixing the match and winning you this one.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the blimmin' limit.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not talk about limits, Dastoor Ahmed...

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa's right.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wretch has broken goodness-knows how many hearts in one shot...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe he can sleep peacefully... With his honour intact.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay here, Dastoor Ahmed...

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let him

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slip away!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slip away?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd she say that?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because he's about to.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where to?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's only one place he can go.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd leave for a few years...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And come back when Maheen's had a few kids...

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saying,

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Blimey, are they cute'!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's putting one over us all!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One what?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh wait...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean pulling one over us...

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's pulling our legs,

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And ruthless Ammi Begum

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is set to kick him in the teeth.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay on your guard. He may run away for real this time.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well done!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very well done!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
50 gee.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
50...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All for me?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But your job's not done yet.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I may need a few more pages...

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll write whatever you want.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Umm...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you...

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Return the photocopy?

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Photocopy?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He thinks I've fallen for him'...

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The poor prat'!

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If this be love, dear'...

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'May you'

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Groan in agony'...

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Amour"' (Love),

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Je te déteste"' (I hate you)...

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
