1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,528
Maheen?

2
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:26,659
Maheen!

3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,698
Maheen!

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,158
Fajr!

5
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:34,212
Fajr!

6
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,464
Call the doctor! Maheen's not --

7
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,233
What's up, Mum?

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,089
Mum...?

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,288
Mum...

10
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,518
What?

11
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,488
What happened?

12
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,859
(Maheen...)

13
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,359
(Maheen?)

14
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,319
(Maheen...)

15
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,141
What'd you nick just now?

16
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,111
You complete blighter!

17
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:56,433
I was just droppin' by to say hi.

18
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,209
But you were sleeping as if you've got everything.

19
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,658
Come here...

20
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,888
What's the time?

21
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:19,249
Almost midnight.

22
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,469
You alright?

23
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,443
'Course. That's why I was sleeping so peacefully.

24
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:31,213
Girls... Blimey...

25
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:33,933
Tell them

26
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,743
They're getting what they've always wanted,

27
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,624
And they sleep without a care!

28
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,434
It's nothing like that.

29
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,220
The doctor gave me a few meds after the bullet incident.

30
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,968
They're a lot better at doing their job.

31
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:52,459
But why are you here so late?

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,908
Just... Felt like comin'?

33
00:03:56,208 --> 00:04:02,318
Thought I'd sit with you a while... Have a chat...

34
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:04,469
It'd ease me.

35
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,204
You worried?

36
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,468
Aye.

37
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,999
Why?

38
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,908
I just found out yesterday

39
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,078
That Mum

40
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:27,748
Was innocent all along.

41
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,921
Whoa...

42
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,758
Dad's shaken.

43
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,548
Ashamed at everything he did.

44
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,658
What good is it?

45
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,870
She died a grieving woman.

46
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:51,024
Not entirely Dad's fault though.

47
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:53,875
What happened?

48
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,228
I will... Someday...

49
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,748
For now, I'm... Looking for him...

50
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,898
I swear...

51
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,039
I'll settle all scores.

52
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,344
But you said he died with your Mum in the car crash?

53
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,950
So he did, aye...

54
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,938
But his kids...

55
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,321
Gotta pay...

56
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,447
For the sins of their father...

57
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,968
Not fair, Jiya.

58
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,388
What's their fault?

59
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,250
That blighter's dead.

60
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,260
You can do anything you want and he won't even stir in his grave.

61
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,798
You don't know, but he will...

62
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:05,762
I know his soul's lurking around here somewhere...

63
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,988
Anyway...

64
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,958
Have a good night's sleep...

65
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:30,059
I'll be back.

66
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,988
Take care.

67
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:37,631
Won't you have a cuppa?

68
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,063
No.

69
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,608
I don't need a cuppa to stay awake now.

70
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,710
Bye.

71
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,778
Bye.

72
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,758
Jiya!

73
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,833
When'd you get in?

74
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:24,521
Just a while ago?

75
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,681
Sorry I didn't call...

76
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,461
Just... Wanted to see her.

77
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:32,834
Can't believe you're done so quickly!

78
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,195
The blighter's turned in!

79
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,896
Won't you have anything?

80
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,976
Next time?

81
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,498
I've got old ties to this place...

82
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,538
I'll come knocking like I have a right...

83
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,208
Bye.

84
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,109
Hi partner!

85
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,319
Hi.

86
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,861
Lemme guess. She didn't take your call, so you thought you'd ask Fajr.

87
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,250
No, mate...

88
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,651
Worry not though

89
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:31,901
The conditions have become completely concordant. Restrictions have been lifted.

90
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:34,472
You can meet her easily.

91
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,830
Speaking of which, why don't you two ever meet?

92
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,788
Honestly

93
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:42,618
I find it a sight to behold to see two lovers meet!

94
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,009
See?

95
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,788
Even you think I love her.

96
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:49,368
I've always known it.

97
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,808
She realised it a tad late.

98
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,939
May I confide in you?

99
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:55,639
Yes?

100
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:59,250
But promise me it will stay between us.

101
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,920
It will; you don't need my word for it.

102
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,930
I don't love her.

103
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,968
Ohhh!

104
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,498
I swear

105
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,898
I was just teasing her.

106
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,330
She used to be so proud of herself,

107
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,789
And now

108
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,800
Look how I've shattered her ego!

109
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,313
Put a sock in it.

110
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,920
It's your ego that's been shattered.

111
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,588
Springing off into the sky like that!

112
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:26,470
I'm not joking, Fajr...

113
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,559
I'm not joking either.

114
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,949
I understand love better than both of you. Combined.

115
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,190
That's why I feel guilty.

116
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,160
Keep up with it.

117
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,260
Keep feeling guilty for the rest of your life.

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,619
Fajr, I'm so ashamed of myself and you don't even get it...

119
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:47,534
I mean -- Her calling me and my turning back doesn't mean we love each other.

120
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:51,363
Just think -- our quarrel's been resolved.

121
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,454
Do you even know that she refused to wear the engagement ring?

122
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:56,564
I know.

123
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,394
The silly girl.

124
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:00,730
What made her act so foolishly and unashamedly?

125
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,728
Trapped me with herself.

126
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,228
Trapped?

127
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,791
Of course.

128
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:09,539
Everyone's thinking we've got something going on.

129
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,984
I'm almost dying of shame.

130
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,079
How do I even begin to tell you I'd never even imagined I'd marry a country girl!

131
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,624
Who told you to lie like that?

132
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,652
I was lying back then.

133
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,039
But now I'm telling the truth.

134
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:27,719
100%.

135
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,309
Upon reflection...

136
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,801
I realised I shouldn't have flirted with her.

137
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,616
After all, she's my cousin, mate.

138
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,770
My Aunt's daughter.

139
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,911
But I'm so stupid.

140
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:45,330
I ended up making a mistake.

141
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,535
Curse your filthy mouth!

142
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,848
There!

143
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:52,610
I knew you'd all curse me if you ever found out.

144
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,738
But... Could <i>you</i> not say that?

145
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,568
Are you going back?

146
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:57,879
No.

147
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,792
You're blowing the gaff on yourself and stayin' put here?

148
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:04,671
I'll go, mate. In a few days.

149
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,379
But

150
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,469
First, I'll apologise to her.

151
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:10,943
What?

152
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,494
Aye.

153
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,030
Today itself.

154
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,931
Then don't tarry. You've got your chance.

155
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:18,972
She's still awake.

156
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,162
She's still awake.

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,549
Someone's got a knack for catching me red-handed.

177
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,469
I thought you'd turned in.

178
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,468
Go.

179
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:57,349
Or Wali will get up too.

180
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,796
He sent me.

181
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,841
He said there's no smoke without a fire.

182
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:12,891
Here.

183
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,511
Were it so easy...

184
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,839
These flames burnt your letters. A different flame's searing the two of us.

185
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,883
Tell me...

186
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:35,822
Does every lover get his love?

187
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,480
No. Yes?

188
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,128
Hardly new, this...

189
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,189
I didn't get her.

190
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,782
I'll settle for someone else.

191
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,838
Sure?

192
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,482
Sure.

193
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,188
Why'd you collect these ashes, then?

194
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:14,518
I thought

195
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:17,958
I'd scatter them in the sea tomorrow.

196
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,088
Should I find you a match?

197
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,568
No.

198
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,689
Find me a second match.

199
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,960
Or it'll sound so weird.

200
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,782
Find a good one.

201
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,442
But...

202
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,908
Not better than <i>her</i>.

203
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,532
Here's your cuppa!

204
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,027
You off your head? It's midnight!

205
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:36,890
How will I doze off?

206
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:41,467
That's what I want. Have it and open your eyes.

207
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:43,358
What d'you mean?

208
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:45,372
It's just an excuse...

209
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:48,282
I've got news that will keep you awake.

210
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:49,672
Here.

211
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,307
Have a sip.

212
00:18:51,307 --> 00:18:52,823
Tell me.

213
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:55,023
Have a sip first.

214
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,158
So, breaking news.

215
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:07,878
The Romeo from London is smitten with you.

216
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,709
Aren't you surprised?

217
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:20,219
You better be.

218
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,829
That ain't all.

219
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,462
I swear it is.

220
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:28,349
I'm just telling it my way.

221
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,990
Care to explain?

222
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,280
Of course.

223
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,208
He called me a while back.

224
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,322
He said he doesn't love you

225
00:19:39,322 --> 00:19:41,353
And was just flirting.

226
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,414
Then, he asked me

227
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:48,056
If I thought he could ever fall for a country girl.

228
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,308
Hold your horses and let me finish!

229
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,818
Cool down and think about it carefully.

230
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,938
He's coming here to say sorry.

231
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:04,148
For?

232
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:09,179
For when he, with his head in Nano's lap, said he loved you.

233
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,870
Upon reflection, he figured

234
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,978
He didn't.

235
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:17,659
He was cursing you.

236
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:22,289
He said refusing the ring was a big mistake.

237
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,988
You earned him a bad name.

238
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:28,379
He's coming to say sorry for <i>that</i>?

239
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,259
That's what he said.

240
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,952
How could you take that quietly?

241
00:20:32,952 --> 00:20:36,003
I didn't! I cursed his filthy mouth!

242
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:39,878
Why didn't you curse him with death already?

243
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:45,128
Not so fast! Not before you know who made him say it!

244
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:47,419
I swear I wasn't angry.

245
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,960
He felt... Like someone so close...

246
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,210
English roses? He's just teasing you!

247
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,240
I know he's so desi [Asian] as to sacrifice his love for Gulrez!

248
00:20:56,284 --> 00:20:59,076
Ammi Begum must've said something about the family's honour...

249
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,777
He grabbed his chance to play Romeo.

250
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,014
Know what?

251
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,950
His type can be found singing at their beloved's weddings. Exempli gratia...

256
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,908
Slap him the moment you see him!

257
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:27,612
In fact, it's just fair to rip his face apart!

258
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,378
Hello?

259
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,119
Peace be upon you, Ammi Begum.

260
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,059
Upon you as well.

261
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,570
Where's the lad?

262
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,699
Who?

263
00:21:57,758 --> 00:21:59,499
Waqar.

264
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,919
Slouching about in his room.

265
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,118
I'm not humouring him.

266
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:05,731
Whoa...

267
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,294
Where'd she go then?

268
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,668
Who?

269
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:12,968
Maheen!

270
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,638
At this hour?

271
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,838
It's half past midnight!

272
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:23,093
She left in a fit of rage!

273
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,948
Call and ask her.

274
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:29,528
D'you seriously think she'd be angry with <i>him</i>?

275
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:32,779
I called her. Her phone's in her room.

276
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:34,919
Byrlady...

277
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,298
Where'd she go?

278
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,392
Ask Fajr.

279
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:40,738
I asked her.

280
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:44,359
That wretch said, 'You're gonna tell Ammi Begum if I told you'.

281
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:47,369
They're all in it together!

282
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,989
Munshi Alam!

283
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,621
Munshi Alam!

284
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,828
I think I've got my answer...

285
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,900
I'll get back once I'm through with her.

286
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,208
Who is it?

287
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,459
Wee Maheen.

288
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,661
Where's Dastoor and Mehru?

289
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,260
It's half past midnight! I'm sure they turned in!

290
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,888
Did I ask you the time?

291
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,869
Waqar Ahmed. Where is he?

292
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,298
Someone seems to have forgotten all her manners!

293
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,388
And...

294
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,640
D'you seriously think I'd know where to find a wastrel like that rotter?

295
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,661
Rouse Dastoor.

296
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,148
Ma'am.

297
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,639
Not the day after. I got to leave tomorrow.

298
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,650
I'll get back to you in a sec. Bye.

299
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,198
Heard you called Fajr.

300
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:41,868
What?

301
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,189
Care to tell me

302
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:46,753
Everything you told her?

303
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,458
Yeah?

304
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,378
Okay...

305
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:02,720
You must be embarrassed.

306
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,559
How 'bout

307
00:25:05,178 --> 00:25:07,108
You tell everyone?

308
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,878
I've roused him.

309
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,538
Stay right here.

310
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,899
C'mon! Tell everyone right now!

311
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,058
What is it?

312
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,669
Hold it.

313
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,891
Let 'em sort it out.

314
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,490
Don't say that, Nano...

315
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,188
This is no longer just between us.

316
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:44,359
So...

317
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:46,848
Why don't you tell 'em everything?

318
00:25:47,188 --> 00:25:49,639
Say those fiery words

319
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:53,141
And shatter my ego for Nano to see!

320
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,119
You look like a man, Waqar Ahmed.

321
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,949
Show 'em you are one for real.

322
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,461
I would hate to poke my nose where it doesn't belong,

323
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:13,421
But care to tell me

324
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:18,571
What this little domestic at <i>my</i> place is all about?

325
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,681
Aye, hero?

326
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,309
Tell 'em and win their hearts.

327
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,059
Look at her

328
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:34,330
Shamelessly prattling on and on and on...

329
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,670
Don't you want to tell them?

330
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,378
Okay...

331
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,419
Fair 'nuff...

332
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,849
I'll tell 'em myself...

333
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:51,829
Remember how you all thought

334
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,359
He's fallen for me?

335
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,689
You were mighty mistaken.

336
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,748
He was just flirting.

337
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,540
Upon reflection... He felt ashamed...

338
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,018
How could he flirt with his Aunt's girl?

That's what you told Fajr, right?

That's what you told Fajr, right?

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,238
I hope you were serious about that.

00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,978
Aye.

345
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,958
Promise me you always will be.

Promise.

353

I'll finish you off

354
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,705
Where you won't get an ounce of relief.

355
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,798
I don't care!

356
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,549
Poor Gulrez!

357
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,982
So you said

358
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:18,129
You don't love Maheen?

359
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,328
Aye.

360
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,860
So you were just taking her for a ride?

361
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,829
Slap some sense into him, will you?

362
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,919
The blighter's lying through his teeth.

363
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,924
'I don't love her'!

364
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,888
Could you check if he's in his room or made a run for it?

365
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,748
He's sleeping.

366
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:06,570
Those who sleep peacefully after hearing all sorts of insults have no honour.

367
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,590
He's not sleeping.

368
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:12,699
He's put his honour to sleep.

369
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,530
What d'you mean?

370
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,493
Forget it, Ammi Begum.

371
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:19,480
You'd mind it if I said something.

372
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,508
You got to say it.

373
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,989
Willy-nilly.

374
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:36,032
Yeah, say it or she's gonna be furious.

375
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,828
Shut up, Dastoor Ahmed...

376
00:32:41,408 --> 00:32:44,018
So... Tell me...

377
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:48,739
Why's he putting his honour to sleep?

378
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,559
He loves you a lot.

379
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,040
After falling for Maheen,

380
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:01,081
He feels your word and the family's honour [Waqar] are at stake.

381
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:06,901
He's thinking of fixing the match and winning you this one.

382
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,951
That's the blimmin' limit.

383
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,178
You better not talk about limits, Dastoor Ahmed...

384
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,048
Mehrunnisa's right.

385
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:26,539
The wretch has broken goodness-knows how many hearts in one shot...

386
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,808
Can't believe he can sleep peacefully... With his honour intact.

387
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,909
Stay here, Dastoor Ahmed...

388
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:46,129
Don't let him

389
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,970
Slip away!

390
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,260
Slip away?

391
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,678
Why'd she say that?

392
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,149
Because he's about to.

393
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,631
Where to?

394
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:15,147
There's only one place he can go.

395
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:18,700
He'd leave for a few years...

396
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,410
And come back

397
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,720
When Maheen's had a few kids...

398
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,620
Saying,

399
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,278
'Blimey, are they cute'!

400
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:27,639
Hmm...

401
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,921
He's putting one over us all!

402
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,758
One what?

403
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:35,418
Oh wait...

404
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:38,979
You mean pulling one over us...

405
00:34:39,529 --> 00:34:41,024
Aye.

406
00:34:41,198 --> 00:34:44,913
He's pulling our legs,

407
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,771
And ruthless Ammi Begum

408
00:34:47,804 --> 00:34:51,375
Is set to kick him in the teeth.

409
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:57,014
Stay on your guard. He may run away for real this time.

410
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,151
Well done!

411
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,893
Very well done!

412
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,924
50 gee...

413
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:45,180
50 gee...

414
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,420
All for me?

415
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,850
Of course.

416
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,922
But your job's not done yet.

417
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,358
I may need a few more pages...

418
00:35:56,798 --> 00:35:58,869
Don't worry.

419
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:02,189
I'll write whatever you want.

420
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,014
Umm...

421
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,801
Could you...

422
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:08,942
Return the photocopy?

423
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,569
Huh?

424
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:11,930
Photocopy?

425
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:13,824
Aye...

426
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,868
'He thinks I've fallen for him'...

427
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,361
'The poor prat'!

428
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,797
'If this be love, dear'...

429
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,489
'May you'

430
00:36:51,577 --> 00:36:53,833
'Groan in agony'...

431
00:36:55,437 --> 00:36:57,037
'"Amour"' (Love),

432
00:36:57,627 --> 00:37:00,490
'"Je te déteste"' (I hate you)...

433
