1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
foo

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi partner!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She mustn't be answering, so you'd have thought to ask Fajr.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, mate...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Worry not though

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The conditions have become completely concordant.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Restrictions have been lifted.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can meet her easily.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of which, why don't you two ever meet?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I find it a sight to behold to see two lovers meet!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even you think that I am in love with her.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd known it for long

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She realized it a tad late.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I confide in you?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But promise me that it will stay between us.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It will; you don't need my word for it.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't love her.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ohhh!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just testing her

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She used to be so proud of herself

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look how I've shattered her ego.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your ego that's been shattered.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Springing off into the sky like that!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not joking, Fajr...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not joking either.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understand love better than both of you.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I feel guilty.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with it.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep feeling guilty for the rest of your life.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr, I'm so ashamed of myself and you're not understanding it.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's -- Her calling me and my turning back does not mean that we love each other.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think -- our quarrel has been resolved.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you even know

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she refused to wear the ring at the time of the engagement?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such silliness.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What made her act so foolishly and unashamedly?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trapped me with herself.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trapped?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of this, everyone's thinking that we've got something going between ourselves.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Am I'm on the verge of dying out of shame.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I even begin to tell you that I'd never even imagined that I'd marry a country girl!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's asking you to lie to me?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was lying back then.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now I'm telling the truth.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
100%

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon reflection...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I realized that I shouldn't have flirted with her.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After all, she's my cousin, mate.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My aunt's daughter.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm so stupid.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ended up making a mistake.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse your filthy mouth!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd curse me if you ever came to know the truth.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the very least, you don't say it like that.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you going back?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're blowing the gaff on yourself and staying here?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go, mate. I'm leaving in a few days.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, I'll apologize to her.

71
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,925
What?

72
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:12,352
Yes.

73
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,045
In fact, I'm thinking of apologizing today itself.

74
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,856
Then don't tarry.

75
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,060
Ask forgiveness today itself.

76
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,249
She's still awake.

77
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:32,449
Love's testimony is not to be asked of it

78
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:46,695
It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes

79
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:56,292
Ask all you will what comes out of love

80
00:11:56,718 --> 00:12:06,792
The heart is its maker, and ends up being destroyed by it

81
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:20,708
In the tale of love

82
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:27,453
In the tale of love

83
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:37,057
Where do these turns come from

84
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:43,915
In the tale of love

85
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:48,665
Where do these turns come from

86
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:53,291
That those we hold dear to us

87
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:58,075
Are the ones who break our heart

88
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:02,697
That those we hold dear to us

89
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:07,479
Are the ones who break our heart

90
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:12,087
In the tale of love

91
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:16,930
Where do these turns come from

92
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,560
That those we hold dear to us

93
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,308
Are the ones who break our heart

94
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:30,977
That those we hold dear to us

95
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:36,587
Are the ones who break our heart

96
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,043
You know what?

97
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,732
His type can be found singing at their beloved's wedding. Want to listen?

98
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:11,448
<i>This lambent, sightly procession</i>

99
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:14,407
<i>To whom do I present this?</i>

100
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,725
<i>This magnificent --</i>

101
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:23,498
Slap him the moment you see him!

102
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:26,914
Rather, under such conditions, even ripping apart his head is justified!

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Ammi Begum.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you as well.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the lad?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Waqar.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
