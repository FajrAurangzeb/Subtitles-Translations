Maman... Who is she?

7
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:04,688
Who -- Who's speaking English?

8
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,947
Sorry Nano...

9
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,588
Hmph...

10
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,508
Hmph!

11
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,759
Ammi Begum, please take your medicine.

12
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,448
You ask her.

13
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,148
Have you called the lawyer?

14
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,839
Yes.

15
00:02:48,198 --> 00:02:50,869
He'll be here by the morning.

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,998
Morning --

17
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,390
The bequest...

18
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,819
I've kept it in the casket.

19
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,378
If --

20
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,148
If the morning sun is one I get to witness, alright;

21
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:18,798
E --

22
00:03:19,178 --> 00:03:25,279
Else, it is to be considered my last will and testament.

23
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,968
It is indeed you!

24
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,818
Your hair have turned all grey in a mere eight years!

25
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,318
Won't you pull me into an embrace?

26
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:16,169
Come.

27
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,411
Please, Ammi Begum

28
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:34,681
Don't speak English, you wastrel!

29
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,618
The rapscallion might come knocking.

30
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,189
Inheritance --

31
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:11,589
If word got out that he may get a share --

32
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,650
Perhaps he'll pay a visit...

33
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,548
I used to think --

34
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,797
He deserves not a penny

35
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:43,138
That I should write,

36
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:48,289
'The rotter has been disinherited'.

37
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,218
Then I thought --

38
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,138
He who got his hereditament

39
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:07,378
But remained forever unloved...

40
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:12,408
What has he really earned?

41
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,589
Ahh...

42
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,838
Why did you come to receive me if you despise me so much?

43
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,788
My Maheen is here...

44
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,610
A -- After eight long years, I'm hearing

45
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,041
The rathe shuffling of your footsteps...

46
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,460
Just like this, you used to come eagerly

47
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,200
Hying --

48
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,730
As if --

49
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,760
As if you'd trample everyone under your feet...

50
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,828
You're afraid, aren't you?

51
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,588
You'd have --

52
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,438
You'd have felt that --

53
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:33,807
Before your arrival --

54
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,438
Ahh...

55
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,058
Tomorrow --

56
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:57,957
Tomorrow, put up a nice game of cricket in the lawn,

57
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,029
And I'll show you what it means to be vivified.

58
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,515

Munshi Alam,

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,288
Why have you called me?

67
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,978
Actually, Ammi Begum --

68
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,899
What happened to Dado?

69
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,990
She's still with us, isn't she?

70
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,720
She...

71
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,860
Won't be for much longer...

72
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,220
So say her doctors.

73
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,411
You cannot go there!

74
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:50,770
She'd die by your footfalls.

75
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:54,672
And if you do get there,

76
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:58,211
Neelam will tear your face apart,

77
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,422
Wali will hurl expletives at you,

78
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:03,862
And Suraiyya Bibi will smite you.

79
00:11:03,862 --> 00:11:08,472
And all of this will be too much for Ammi Begum to witness.

80
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,952
Then why have you called me here?

81
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,008
For now, come inside.

82
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,698
I'll tell you at length.

83
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:19,869
Have some tea first; have a smoke,

84
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:23,217
Then I'll tell you why I called you. Come.

85
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,947
Gotten married?

86
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,038
You would have...

87
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:21,568
No?

88
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,408
How many kids do you have?

89
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,050
I'd be delighted

90
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,998
To hear about the kids...

91
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,800
Where did you get my address?

92
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,270
From Jiya.

93
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,470
She was the one who told me that you now live in France.

94
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,852
Where does Jiya live?

95
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,961
I asked not.

96
00:12:56,961 --> 00:13:00,460
She didn't seem inclined to tell anyway.

97
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,651
So I just asked humbly where you live.

98
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:10,160
The will and testament shall be written down tomorrow.

99
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,998
Ammi Begum had, before me,

100
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:19,738
Written a lot in her bequest.

101
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,325
You'll be getting a lot.

102
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:26,987
I thought it'd do you good to come and collect it.

103
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,248
Dado...

104
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:55,441
She misses you a lot.

105
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,992
When at a loss for imprecations

106
00:13:57,992 --> 00:14:00,990
Seeking to utterly miscall somebody

107
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,940
Then

108
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,761
Yours is the name that occurs to her.

109
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,158
And when your name finally escapes her mouth

110
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,528
She hoicks to rid herself of the gob.

111
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:14,169
Like this...

112
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,698
Neelam...

113
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,379
Come, it's too late already...

114
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,208
I -- I can't fall asleep...

115
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,748
I feel afraid.

116
00:16:07,748 --> 00:16:11,578
Alright, how about some tea --
-No, no.

117
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:14,729
I just want you to be with me for a while.

118
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:16,908
Talk to me...

119
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:20,568
It would've been more proper of you to bring your wife and kids along,

120
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:23,229
Being all alone -- it frightens me too.

121
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,369
Anyway; come.

122
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,949
Photos of the kids?

123
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,968
I don't have kids.

124
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,688
No wife either.

125
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I haven't gotten married, Munshi Alam.

126
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,458
I couldn't bring myself to get married, Munshi Alam.

127
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,898
I'm not among those who can mend their broken hearts with another.

128
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,978
And I feel that the heart I broke with my own hands

129
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:17,850
Often becomes more alluring than ever.

130
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,928
And in such love I could never think of the trifles of matrimony.

131
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,140
And even when it did occur to me

132
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,128
I heard a voice asking, 'To whom'?

133
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:43,233
You tell me - Who'd I have gotten married to?

134
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,018
Jiya.

135
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,478
I would have, sure.

136
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,297
But there is no second option in love.

137
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,549
You know what I mean by 'option', right?

138
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,928
There is no option of perfidy in love either.

139
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:26,039
One seeks company every moment

140
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,869
Not daring to contemplate separation.

141
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,649
You know

142
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,631
What Ammi Begum

143
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,960
Plans to write

144
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,679
At the very end of her will?

145
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,828
What?

146
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,890
That Waqar Ahmed

147
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:57,949
Not be permitted to either see my exanimate face or bear my pall.

148
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,259
She despises me so much?

149
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,529
So much affection she had for you.

150
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,578
Shall I make some tea for you?

151
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,840
By the way, I have also prepared your favourite dishes.

152
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,780
I haven't forgotten your tastes.

153
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,258
I'm not eating anything.

154
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,628
Alright.

155
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,098
I'll sit here for a while.

156
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,608
How is she, Munshi Alam?

157
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:08,250
When you were being sent off to England for the first time, I was the one to express the strongest opposition.

158
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,909
I had said repeatedly

159
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,140
That you'd get accustomed to being distant.

160
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,070
Tales of love, you'd believe, are a thing only in India and Pakistan.

161
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,761
I have seen, Waqar Ahmed

162
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:27,129
Neither does the soil in which one has not played stick to one's feet and stop him,

163
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:31,859
Nor does the one leaving notice that someone is stopping him.

164
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,018
The same has happened with you, Waqar Ahmed.

165
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,998
You have spent your days of romping among feringees

166
00:20:43,998 --> 00:20:47,518
And come back here in search of love.

167
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,567
But

168
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:53,287
Treacheries such as theirs don't work here.

169
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:55,348
And so

170
00:20:55,348 --> 00:20:58,309
You lost,

171
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,020
And defeated us as well.

172
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,859
I asked how she is.

173
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,768
Her gait has slowed down

174
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,919
She speaks little

175
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,578
And speaks as if

176
00:21:24,578 --> 00:21:26,378
She's afeard

177
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:28,428
Unnerved...

178
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,710
Doesn't she play cricket nowadays?

179
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:39,910
I left my job at Kaneez Mahal five years ago.

180
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,978
I retired when my son enlisted in the Marine Police.

181
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,481
I do sometimes visit them

182
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:49,181
I meet all of them

183
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:53,052
And meet all of them to know

184
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:55,103
That they're all fine.

185
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:59,002
In these five years,

186
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:01,962
I've seen her twice.

187
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,128
Greeting me

188
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:07,098
And turning away momentarily.

189
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,138
Has she gotten married?

190
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,458
Munshi Alam, I asked if she's gotten --

191
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,208
N -- Nano!

192
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,768
You silly girl.

193
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:46,068
Your screams beckon to everyone; For once, call out my name. Please.

194
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,298
Look at yourself. You look a bit too boorish and skint.

195
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,389
Let me get hold of you, I'll tell you everything.

196
00:22:50,389 --> 00:22:52,580
I'd die rather than you catch hold of me.

197
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,968
You took it so seriously!

198
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,678
Please go.

199
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,977
Step aside.

200
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,960
Time to take your medicines.

201
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,978
May I come in?

202
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,978
Come in, Uncle.

203
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,128
Get up, Nano.
-C'mon.

204
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:34,988
Rinse your mouth.

205
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,090
Have your breakfast.

206
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,588
If you and Suraiyya come into my room for the night

207
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:32,857
Fear does not let you fall asleep.

208
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,988
You're afraid that I may be breathing my last.

209
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:42,988
But her...

210
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,008
She slept so peacefully

211
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:50,509
As if she could ensure that would never happen.

212
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,897
Have your breakfast.

213
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,601
I promise, Nano.

214
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,348
I won't let you breathe your last just like that.

215
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,587
Did you hear that, Dastoor Ahmed?

216
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:18,377
I ask Death to provide me respite to work on my last testament

217
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:24,888
And this numbskull's making promises that she won't let me breathe my last just like that.

218
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:29,129
Ask for respite from me,

219
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,145
For Death never grants any.

220
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,998
Alright, give me respite

221
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:44,458
So that I can leave him his deserved share.

222
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:48,299
He inherits half my property

223
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,830
And all my odium.

224
00:26:52,940 --> 00:27:07,130
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i> ♪

225
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:21,060
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i> ♪

226
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:30,150
♪ <i>Ask all you may what comes out of falling in love</i> ♪

227
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:41,970
♪ <i>The heart is its creator and it ends up being destroyed by it...</i> ♪

228
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:46,139
He's here, Nano.

229
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,458
He's here?

230
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:54,178
Where is he, Dastoor?

231
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:56,808
Where is the varlet?

232
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,198
Who told you?

233
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:08,008
I don't know anything about this.

234
00:28:08,628 --> 00:28:11,177
Only I get the news.

235
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:15,769
Whenever he comes here,

236
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,408
The cacti in Nano's lawn blossom.

237
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,228
Sorry to hear you left your job at Dado's place.

238
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:55,429
Sorry to hear that

239
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,870
You left everyone.

240
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,869
It was after you left that I realized

241
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:06,840
That she could go through any mishanter

242
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,000
And therefore, I had no reservations about retiring.

243
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,911
Honestly, she didn't feel bad in the slightest either.

244
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:18,320
I said to her, 'I'm leaving'.

245
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,910
And she said, 'Leave'.

246
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:24,671
Today

247
00:29:24,671 --> 00:29:27,611
The will is going to be drafted

248
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,441
I'll give you

249
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:35,750
Its signed copy.

250
00:29:35,891 --> 00:29:38,571
Then, you're free to leave.

251
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:43,441
I want to meet Dado.

252
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,928
Rather

253
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,188
I want to meet them all.

254
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,570
I suggest

255
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,700
That you should not meet them.

256
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,630
Dastoor Uncle will slap me, right?

257
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,600
And Aunt will tear my face apart?

258
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,948
And Aunt Mehru?

259
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:22,038
What'll she do?

260
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,771
She'll be derisively wounding.

261
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,768
I'll take that slap,

262
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,827
Take those curses,

263
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,407
But I'm not leaving without meeting Dado.

264
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,536
Now

265
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:53,356
The doors of Kaneez Mahal are locked for outsiders.

266
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:59,317
When a stranger knocks,

267
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,560
The servants ask,

268
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,167
'Who are you'?

269
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,118
'Where do you come from, and'

270
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:08,679
'Who do you want to meet'?

271
00:31:09,198 --> 00:31:14,568
The servants have been shown your picture

272
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:19,879
And instructed that this man is not to be permitted inside.

273
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:26,529
Then why are they giving me a share of the property?

274
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,988
This, too, is an expression of their disgust,

275
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:38,949
Or is it perhaps that you are no longer capable

276
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,350
Of being despised?

277
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,168
Therefore

278
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:49,779
Every connection of yours with Kaneez Mahal

279
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,457
Ends with this will.

280
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,498
Good Lord!

281
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:59,488
Ammi Begum had said the same thing when she got to know of your departure.

282
00:33:00,907 --> 00:33:03,167
'Good Lord'!

283
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,839
And her voice reflected the same torment.

284
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,989
You're not crying,

285
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:15,283
Are you?

286
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,398
No.

287
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:23,618
Surely not.

288
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:26,848
You're on the rack.

289
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:31,128
Everyone was on the rack that day,

290
00:33:31,128 --> 00:33:33,339
Weeping.

291
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,827
You don't know the circumstances that made me leave.

292
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,370
They don't either.

293
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,667
And I guess I can't even explain now.

294
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,798
Why are you smiling?

295
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,008
The story you're concealing so hard

296
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:14,712
Is etched on the walls of Kaneez Mahal.

297
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,138
Everyone's read it

298
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,368
Everyone's heard it.

299
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,448
What?

300
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,718
So everyone knows what happened that day?

301
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,768
Yes, everyone knows it.

302
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,047
So was it wrong on my part?

303
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:44,508
Should I not have left?

304
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,628
No one else

305
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:52,370
Can answer that.

306
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,728
When leave this time, you'd start asking yourself

307
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:59,718
If you should have gone there.

308
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:02,628
And if you ever return,

309
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:04,553
You'd say to yourself,

310
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:08,580
'No, I should not have left'.

311
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,558
The will is being drafted there.

312
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:21,398
I've been called as a witness.

313
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:22,658
I'm leaving.

314
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:25,468
I'll be back before lunch.

315
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,720
What are you doing?

316
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
