1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,550
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

2
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:06,544
Get him out of my sights.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,590
Drag him away if you have to.

4
00:00:11,422 --> 00:00:12,818
Come.

5
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:15,470
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

6
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,283
Just a second --

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,447
Just a second, Uncle Dastoor.

8
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,972
I swear by you, Dado.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,948
If I left this time,

10
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,071
I'm never coming back.

11
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:09,282
Das --

12
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:11,412
Dastoor Ahmed!

13
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:15,168
Dastoor Ahmed! Stop him!

14
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,876
Ask him to not leave!

15
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,617
Tell him I've forgiven him!

16
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,139
Every breath of mine craved to see you, you glaikit...

17
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,876
I used to pray

18
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,599
That my Waqar come back.

19
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,751
That I depart only after seeing him.

20
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,583
Forgive me, Dado.

21
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,941
I'm wicked.

22
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:37,405
I have made a mistake.

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,477
I've been wrong --

24
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,640
What's this?

25
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,990
Yesterday, she was willing to rain bullets on him.

26
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,990
She'd asked Uncle Dastoor

27
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,855
Why the guards had not opened fire on him.

28
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,869
That if he'd broken and entered,

29
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:21,251
He'd be charged for trespassing.

30
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:23,067
And today

31
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,870
She melted like wax.

32
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:28,580
That's how he is, Aunt.

33
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,831
He calls out once and everyone yields.

34
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,541
Even his enemies develop empathy for him.

35
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:38,188
And I'm sure

36
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:40,320
He'd be in Nano's lap right now.

37
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,843
Like someone from play school.

38
00:03:42,938 --> 00:03:45,923
As if he'd get angry if not given his toy.

39
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:47,848
An infant.

40
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,120
Like our Daji.

41
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,983
She's feeding him breakfast.

42
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:57,802
You heard that, Neelam?

43
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:02,436
Nano's feeding him his breakfast.

44
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,255
Stay tuned, Aunt,

45
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,735
For what's coming next.

46
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,977
What's coming next?

47
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,526
What do I know?

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,553
But what's it to kids?

49
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,574
Who knows what they'd ask for next?

50
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,807
Tell Nano

51
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,419
If he asks for something, she has to give it to him.

52
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,518
I'll get back to you soon.

53
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,245
Gotta finish my breakfast.

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,986
Neelam's made some fine sandwiches.

55
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:47,852
Club sandwiches.

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,103
Finish it quickly.

57
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:20,520
I've got something important to talk about.

58
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,421
I'm all ears.

59
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,710
Why not get married?

60
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,868
Why have you stopped like that?

61
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,407
Look at yourself

62
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:43,266
Your hair have started turning grey.

63
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:48,167
Do you intend to remain childless even at this age?

64
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,238
No, Dado.

65
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:52,407
No?

66
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,690
As in?

67
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,753
I don't want to get married.

68
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,018
Why not?

69
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:07,572
Just give me one genuine reason.

70
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,696
Who will I get married to?

71
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,952
Ammi Begum...

72
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:48,922
Someone's calling you.

73
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,479
Aye, Dastoor Ahmed,

74
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,099
Here's something for you -

75
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:10,478
Take Wali along, and head for Maheen's.

76
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:12,330
Maheen's? What's the occasion?

77
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,024
It's time for 'Happy New Year', m'lad.

78
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,952
'Happy New Year'?

79
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:19,114
That's like -- three months away!

80
00:07:19,114 --> 00:07:23,968
Why, then, are you asking what the occasion is?

81
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,836
Alright, Ammi Begum.

82
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,695
I'm on my way.

83
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,947
Where to?

84
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,633
Maheen's.

85
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,630
What's the occasion?

86
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,221
'Happy New Year'.

87
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,581
Spiffing!

88
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,640
Alright, enough talk...

89
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,784
Get a move on quickly.

90
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:44,250
Alright.

91
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:16,799
Aye, so...

92
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:19,629
What were you saying?

93
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,230
What was I saying?

94
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,880
You were asking

95
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,720
Who you'd get married to.

96
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,970
I've found someone...

97
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,099
Someone... You'd found...

98
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,709
Someone...

99
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:52,380
You've come from France for...

100
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,490
No, Dado, it's noth --

101
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,718
And

102
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:58,501
For about four years,

103
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:01,899
She's been seeking you.

104
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,619
No, Dado, it's nothing like that.

105
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:10,444
Get in the car, dear.

106
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,448
I don't have the time,

107
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,789
Nor you the leisure.

108
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,078
When it's time to settle old debts,

109
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:33,556
It's just as well that you requite yours.

110
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,329
Peace, Uncle.

111
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,440
You called upon us suddenly?

112
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,531
Is everything alright?

113
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,431
You look worried --

114
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,080
What happened?

115
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:06,030
No idea.

116
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,940
Ammi Begum called and asked me to get here this instant.

117
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,419
'Happy New Year..'.

118
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,950
'Happy New Year'?

119
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,171
Must be, if she said it.

120
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,932
'Happy New Year'.

121
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,831
Is Nano coming?

122
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,705
No idea.

123
00:10:29,904 --> 00:10:32,265
What do you know then?

124
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,212
She was not in the mood to listen.

125
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,190
Why do you think she's called us?

126
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,829
You guess.

127
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,659
I think Nano's here.

128
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,322
Hey...

129
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,570
What are you looking at like that?

130
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,138
I'm not changing my bequest.

131
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,789
Whatever I've left everyone

132
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:41,613
Remains unchanged...

133
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,630
But today,

134
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,128
I've come to ask you for something.

135
00:11:56,668 --> 00:12:00,278
Let me know when you're generous.

136
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,818
At your service, Nano.

137
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:15,738
Bless you.

138
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:18,396
If you

139
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:22,475
Said something like this, it'd give me strength.

140
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:25,995
Yes, Nano...

141
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,894
You may ask for our heads.

142
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,298
Give your head then.

143
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,130
Return Maheen to me.

144
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:57,140
She's not mentioned in the will,

145
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,151
Which is why

146
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,009
I've come to say this with you as my witnesses;

147
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:12,759
Come to think of it

148
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:17,899
Maheen is rightfully Waqar's.

149
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,981
Do a favour and

150
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:34,260
Give Maheen to Waqar.

151
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:00,560
What are you doing?

152
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,448
I have no objections.

153
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,388
Just ask Maheen.

154
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,067
If so she desires,

155
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:30,788
You may take her right away.

156
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,649
Where is she?

157
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,928
In her room.

158
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,698
Go.

159
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:49,568
Ask her.

160
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:30,520
♪ <i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i> ♪

166
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
Come in.

167
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,389
Nano's here, Maheen.

168
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,253
I know.

169
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:42,578
She wants you for -- Waqar Ahmed.

170
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:51,959
She says

171
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,528
As per the settlement, you're rightfully his.

172
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,159
So --

173
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,250
What did you say?

174
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:12,078
I can't turn her down.

175
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,008
I can't turn her down either.

176
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,260
I asked you

177
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,020
If this is ultion,

178
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:00,540
You said you were safeguarding;

179
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,820
You said I was Waqar Ahmed's treasure in your possession,

180
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,519
I said I'm love itself,

181
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,811
And only those get love

182
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:16,341
Who deserve it;

183
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,445
Else in ceremonies of espousal,

184
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,819
The girl gets a boy

185
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,149
And the boy gets a girl.

186
00:19:24,183 --> 00:19:27,615
One doesn't get his love so easily, Gulrez Akhtar.

187
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,114
Who is it?

188
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:32,425
It's me.

189
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:33,924
Neelam.

190
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,654
I'm coming.

191
00:19:35,734 --> 00:19:38,104
Waqar's here, Maheen.

192
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,538
Aye --

193
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,289
I'm coming.

194
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,568
Did you hear that?

195
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,380
He's here.

196
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,261
I'm going.

197
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,921
Hey...

198
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:21,850
Promise me...

199
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,930
Yeah?

200
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:30,186
My Foxy's leading your wedding procession.

201
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,229
Look at this anklet.

202
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,178
Isn't it nice?

203
00:20:48,268 --> 00:20:50,678
And this bindiya [forehead jewel]?

204
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,258
Good morning.

205
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,871
Good morning.

206
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,648
Wow.

207
00:21:01,818 --> 00:21:03,848
You've brought jewellery.

208
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,439
Show me the bindiya.

209
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,998
Isn't it beautiful?

210
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,311
Is it just you who likes it?

211
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,250
I saw you one day

212
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,543
In Dado's room with a bindiya adorning you.

213
00:21:22,701 --> 00:21:24,860
That's when I bought it.

214
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,721
And this anklet...

215
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,549
Way earlier.

216
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,378
I -- I'll be back.

217
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,469
When you wear these,

218
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,299
The clinking will fill the air.

219
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,968
You're trying to win my heart.

220
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:51,578
I'd won your heart.

221
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:56,108
But lost the wager as I left.

222
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:03,898
And now I have no idea how much atonement is due for that moment of perfidy.

223
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,661
You'll get to know about your atonement soon.

224
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:09,792
Show me the jewellery.

225
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,342
This locket!

226
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:16,512
It's fabulous.

227
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:19,711
Doesn't it look lovely?

228
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,980
What else have you got?

229
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,465
I'll get you whatever you want.

230
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,620
A gown

231
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,527
Just like the one I wore that day,

232
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:41,161
Just like the one I wore that day,
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

233
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:50,325
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it...</i> ♪

234
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,590
Those bangles,

235
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,809
Too fragile to touch,

236
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:58,260
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

237
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,068
My bangle's broken...
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

238
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:02,531
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

239
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,581
That feeling of exhilaration
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

240
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:07,742
That won't let me sleep, that happiness
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

241
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:09,030
That I've got you,

242
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,278
That I've got you,
♪ <i>Ask all you will what comes out of love...</i> ♪

243
00:23:10,278 --> 00:23:17,940
♪ <i>Ask all you will what comes out of love...</i> ♪

244
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:23,028
And if you can, get me my eight long years back...

245
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,168
The eight years nobody bothered to ask

246
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:28,229
How they've gone by.

247
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:29,985
How they've gone by.
♪ <i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i> ♪

248
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:38,839
♪ <i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i> ♪

249
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,689
Tea!

250
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,048
Sunday.

251
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,608
Yes, dear; Sunday night.

252
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:19,518
She's accepted it.

253
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,278
She's happy with it.

254
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:25,768
She's so lively when she talks.

255
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:27,108
Tell me

256
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,028
Will you be here?

257
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,279
No.

258
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,551
No cricket before the wedding, she says.

259
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:39,831
So - you'll be here, won't you?

260
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:43,371
Uh, no --

261
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,772
She says no.

262
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:50,501
She says she'll be here after the wedding.

263
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,788
Why are you saying that?

264
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,871
What's left of your gang now?

265
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:03,081
Alright,

266
00:25:03,181 --> 00:25:04,681
But remember

267
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:06,612
She'll miss you.

268
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,782
Both of you. She'll keep asking

269
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,893
Why you're not here.

270
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:16,178
Alright, talk to Dado.

271
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:23,744
I'd talked to him; he's not coming.

272
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:25,995
Have some shame.

273
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:30,535
You've slipped in two English words.

274
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,068
Anyway, tell me about your studies...

275
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,999
I will, sure.

276
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,251
I'll get back on WhatsApp too.

277
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:55,261
Sorry, Ammi Begum.

278
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:57,911
There's no Urdu word for 'WhatsApp'.

279
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:01,822
Anyway, Ali. Gotta hang up. Someone's calling Ammi Begum.

280
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,879
Aye, m'lad?

281
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:10,118
She wants the same gown.

282
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,969
The same as?

283
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,239
The same as she wore last time.

284
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,659
Great.

285
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:24,427
Now what do I do with this one?

286
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,346
She's not wearing that one.

287
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,188
Let me talk to her.

288
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,850
No Dado, there's nothing to talk about over this.

289
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,380
She's said it, and that's it.

290
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,874
Alright.

291
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,861
That's it then.

292
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,688
Bye.

293
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,129
Take this gown away.

294
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,149
She doesn't want it.

295
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:56,300
She says she'll wear the same one to this wedding as well.

296
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,388
Take it away.

297
00:27:05,939 --> 00:27:08,890
You'll do everything that I want?

298
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,732
Aye.

299
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,469
You're settling debts.

300
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm just trying to make you happy.

301
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,450
I'm chuffed.

302
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,879
I've been waiting for you for eight years.

303
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,890
Waiting for this Sunday night for eight years.

304
00:27:30,504 --> 00:27:33,830
They say you should never ask lovers

305
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,890
How much they love each other,

306
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,190
For nobody can ever express.

307
00:27:41,402 --> 00:27:43,780
But I can, Waqar Ahmed.

308
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,221
So tell me.

309
00:27:45,221 --> 00:27:47,641
How much do you love me?

310
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,398
So much

311
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,381
That Gulrez died

312
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,932
And I lay waiting for you.

313
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,508
That's the one thing I like about you.

314
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:06,109
If one waits for you, you do come in the end.

315
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,808
You never asked me

316
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,578
When I fell in love with you.

317
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,509
The day you slapped me.

318
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,670
That's when.

319
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,029
I was furious then.

320
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:35,145
But seeing your fingers imprinted on my cheek would melt my heart.

321
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,290
Oh?

322
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,621
You used to fight with me over it.

323
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,125
Not with you, Waqar Ahmed.

324
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,560
But with myself.

325
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:47,482
I was afraid

326
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:50,304
That you may find out about it.

327
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,649
When you did find out,

328
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,729
You slapped me again.

329
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,160
If that had been on my face,

330
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,953
I'd never have married Gulrez.

331
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:10,288
But the second slap was your departure,

332
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,938
And took along those marks of your fingers.

333
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,549
Go, now...

334
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,908
Don't see me before Sunday.

335
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,058
I long to see you too

336
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,853
But not now, Waqar Ahmed.

337
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,896
I'll see you on the wedding day.

338
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:17,150
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it...</i> ♪

339
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,518
You never asked me

340
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:23,238
When I fell in love with you.

341
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,200
The day you slapped me.

342
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,478
The day you slapped me.

So much

350
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:45,837
That Gulrez died...

351
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,518
I'm here.

352
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,571
I told you you just need to call me.

353
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:21,520
Why have you come here yourself?

354
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,791
I'm like my Foxy.

355
00:31:23,881 --> 00:31:26,322
I can get up and move any time I want.

356
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:28,171
Come here.

357
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,684
Sit.

358
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,249
Make yourself comfortable here

359
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:47,689
And talk to me.

360
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,118
Wali says I'll be fine soon.

361
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,918
Aye...

362
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,848
What about it?

363
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:59,838
I know you'll be fine soon.

364
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,728
On the contrary...

365
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:06,739
I'd much rather it go on like this.

366
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,693
I prefer it this way.

367
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,648
You looking at me every time...

368
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,528
Getting scared...

369
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,391
I used to think I'd die for nothing,

370
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:26,481
But now I feel I'll leave you in tears, Maheen...

371
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:32,092
You'll break those bangles in your grief...

372
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,558
Your weeping and wailing will know no bounds...

373
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:41,408
Truly,

374
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:44,388
It will be exhilarating...

375
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,910
Shut up!

376
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,209
Hey!

377
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,959
Listen.

378
00:32:56,523 --> 00:32:57,989
You --

379
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:03,430
Why are you all so afraid of dying?

380
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,880
And here

381
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,151
It was only after I died that I realised

382
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,768
Such is life!

383
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:22,797
Go to sleep.

384
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,733
No, Maheen.

385
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,608
Sleep scares me.

386
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,003
Come here, will you?

387
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,310
Sit by me.

388
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,080
Ask me what I'm looking at.

389
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,921
What are you looking at?

390
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,440
Taking your picture.

391
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,068
Ask me how.

392
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,398
How?

393
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,383
When someone gazes their Maheen

394
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:16,719
Like I am right now,

395
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,668
He's actually taking her picture.

396
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,254
The kind

397
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,960
That cannot be printed.

398
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,696
It remains etched in the eyes.

399
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,208
Now ask me

400
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:48,288
What I'm gonna do with it.

401
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,021
What are you gonna do with it?

402
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,641
I've heard there are houries there.

403
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,048
I'll say,

404
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:06,033
'If there's one like this, alright'.

405
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:07,704
'Otherwise, stay away'.

406
00:35:07,704 --> 00:35:09,627
'Otherwise, stay away'.
