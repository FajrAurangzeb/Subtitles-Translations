1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get him out of my sights.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drag him away if you have to.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second --

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second, Dastoor Uncle.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you, Dado.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I left this time,

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never coming back.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Das --

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed! Stop him!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him to not leave!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him I've forgiven him!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every breath of mine craved to see you, you glaikit...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to pray

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That my Waqar come back.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I depart only after seeing him.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, Dado.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm wicked.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have made a mistake.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been wrong --

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yesterday, she was willing to rain bullets on him.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd asked Dastoor Uncle

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why the guards had not opened fire on him.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if he'd broken and entered,

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be charged for trespassing.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And today

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Melted like wax.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how he is, Aunt.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He calls out and everyone yields.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even his enemies develop empathy for him.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm sure

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be in Nano's lap right now.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like someone from play school.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if he'd get angry if not given his toy.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
An infant.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like our Daji.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's feeding him breakfast.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard that, Neelam?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's feeding him his breakfast.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned, Aunt,

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what's coming next.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's coming next?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I know?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what's it to kids

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what they'll ask for and when?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Nano

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he asks for something, she has to give it to him.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll disconnect for now.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have my breakfast.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam's made some fine sandwiches.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Club sandwiches.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eat quickly

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got something important to talk about.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm all ears.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not get married?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why have you stopped like that?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at yourself

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your hair have started turning grey.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you intend to remain childless even at this age?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Dado.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to get married.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me one genuine reason.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whom will I get married to?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's calling you.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Dastoor Ahmed

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's something for you

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take Wali along, and head for Maheen's.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's? What's the occasion?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time for 'Happy New Year', son.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Happy New Year'?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's three months away.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, then, are you asking what the occasion is?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Ammi Begum.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on my way.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where to?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the occasion?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Happy New Year'.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll disconnect.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get a move on quickly.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, so

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were you saying?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was I saying?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were asking

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whom you'd get married to.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have found a girl for you.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rather, you had found her.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For whom you've come here from France.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Dado, it's noth --

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For about four years,

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been seeking you.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Dado, it's nothing like that.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in the car, dear.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have the time,

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor you the leisure.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When it's time to settle old debts

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just as well that you requite yours.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Greetings, Uncle.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called upon us suddenly?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is everything alright?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look worried --

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum called and asked me to get here this instant.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Happy New Year..'.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Happy New Year'?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Must be, if she's said it.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Happy New Year'.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Nano coming?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you know then?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was not in the mood to listen.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you think she's called us?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You guess.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think Nano's here.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at like that?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not changing my bequest.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever I'm leaving everyone, it's as it was.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But today,

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come to ask you for something.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know when you're generous.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At your service, Nano.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Said something like this, it'd give me strength.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Nano...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may ask for our heads.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give your head then.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Return Maheen to me.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not mentioned in the will,

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thus

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've come to say this with you as my witnesses;

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come to think of it

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen is rightfully Waqar's.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do a favour and

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give Maheen to Waqar.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no objections.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just ask Maheen.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If so she desires,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may take her right away.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is she?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In her room.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then</i>

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's here, Maheen.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants you for -- Waqar Ahmed.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As per the settlement, you're rightfully his.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then --

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you say?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I cannot say no to her.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I cannot say no either.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd asked you

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If this is ultion,

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd said you were safeguarding;

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd said I was Waqar Ahmed's treasure in your possession,

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd said I'm love itself,

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And only those get love

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who deserve it;

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Else in ceremonies of espousal,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The girl gets a boy

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the boy gets a girl.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One doesn't just get love, Gulrez Akhtar.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's it?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's me.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar is here, Maheen.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes --

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you hear that?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your wedding procession will be led by my Foxy.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at this anklet.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't it nice?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this bindiya [forehead jewel]?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've brought jewellery.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me this bindiya.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't it beautiful?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it just you who liked it?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd seen you one day

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In Dado's room with a bindiya adorning you.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd bought this that day.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this anklet

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way earlier.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I -- I'll be back.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you wear these,

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The clinking will fill the air.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're trying to win my heart.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd won your heart.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But lost the wager as I left.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now I have no idea how much atonement is due for that moment of perfidy.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get to know about your atonement soon.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me the jewellery.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This locket!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's fabulous.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it look beautiful!

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else have you brought?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll bring you whatever you want.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A gown just like

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one I'd worn that day,

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those bangles,

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Too fragile to touch,

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My bangle's broken...

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That feeling of exhilaration

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That won't let me sleep, that happiness

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I have you,

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you can, bring back my eight long years for me...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those eight years whom nobody asked

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How they've gone by.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea's ready.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, dear; Sunday night.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's accepted it.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's happy with it.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's so lively when she talks.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you be here?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cricket after the marriage, she says.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me - you will be here, won't you?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No --

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's said no.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says she'll be here after the wedding.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you saying that?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with your gang now?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But remember

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll miss you.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Both of you. She'll keep asking

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why you're not here.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, talk to Dado.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd talked to him; he's not coming.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've slipped in two English words.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways, how are your studies going?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, I will.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back via WhatsApp too.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, Ammi Begum.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no Urdu word for 'WhatsApp'.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, Ali. Disconnect for now.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's phone is ringing.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, dear.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wants the same gown.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same as?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same as she wore last time.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now what do I do with this one?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not wearing that one.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me talk to her.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No Dado, there's nothing to talk about over this.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's said it, and that's it.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Disconnect the phone.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take this gown away.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't want it.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's said that she'll wear the same one to this wedding as well.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it away.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll do everything as I desire?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're settling debts.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just trying to make you happy.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm chuffed.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been waiting for you for eight years.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waiting for this Sunday night for eight years.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say you should never ask lovers

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much they love they have.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For nobody can ever express.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can, Waqar Ahmed.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So tell me.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much do you love me?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez died

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I lay waiting for you.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That alone is what's good about you.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If one waits for you, you do come in the end.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've never asked me

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since when I've been in love with you.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The day you slapped me.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's when.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was furious then.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But seeing your fingers imprinted on my cheek would melt my heart.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You used to fight with me over it.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not with you, Waqar Ahmed.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But with myself.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was afraid

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you may come to know about it.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when you did come to know,

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You slapped me again.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If that had been on my face,

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never have married Gulrez.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the second slap was your departure,

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And took along those marks of your fingers.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now go.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't meet me before Sunday.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I long to meet you too

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not now, Waqar Ahmed.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on the wedding day itself.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've never asked me

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since when I've been in love with you.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The day you slapped me.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say you should never ask lovers

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much they love they have.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So tell me.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much do you love me?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez died.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd told you you just need to call me.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why have you come here yourself?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm like my Foxy.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can get up and move any time I want.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make yourself comfortable here

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And talk to me.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali says I'll be fine soon.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about it?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you'll be fine soon.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the contrary...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd much rather it go on like this.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I prefer it this way.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You looking at me time and again...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting scared...

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to think I'd die for nothing

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But now I feel I'll leave you in tears, Maheen...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll break those bangles in your grief...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your weeping and wailing will know no bounds...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Truly,

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It will be exhilarating...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You --

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you all so afraid of dying?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And here

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was only after I died that I realized

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such is life!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to sleep.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Maheen.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sleep scares me.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please come here.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit by me.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me what I'm looking at.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Clicking your photograph.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me how.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When someone gazes their Maheen

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like I am

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He actually clicks her photograph.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the kind that cannot be printed.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It remains captured in the eyes.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now ask

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I will do with your photograph?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What will you do?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard there are houries there.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say,

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If there's one like this, alright'.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Otherwise, stay away'.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then</i>

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate tears.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And then I will forget you...</i>

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
