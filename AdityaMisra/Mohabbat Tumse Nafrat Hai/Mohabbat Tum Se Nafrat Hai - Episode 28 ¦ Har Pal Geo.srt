1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,460
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,050
Get him out of my sights.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,650
Drag him away if you have to.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,170
Come.

5
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,641
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,610
Just a second --

7
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,302
Just a second, Dastoor Uncle.

8
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:29,978
I swear by you, Dado.

9
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:37,386
If I left this time,

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,479
I'm never coming back.

11
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,489
Das --

12
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:11,649
Dastoor Ahmed!

13
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,039
Dastoor Ahmed! Stop him!

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,200
Ask him to not leave!

15
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:26,366
Tell him I've forgiven him!

16
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:09,741
Every breath of mine craved to see you, you glaikit...

17
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:12,481
I used to pray

18
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,521
That my Waqar come back.

19
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:22,351
That I depart only after seeing him.

20
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,146
Forgive me, Dado.

21
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,106
I'm wicked.

22
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,920
I have made a mistake.

23
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,656
I've been wrong --

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,799
What's this?

25
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,160
Yesterday, she was willing to rain bullets on him.

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,180
She'd asked Dastoor Uncle

27
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,150
Why the guards had not opened fire on him.

28
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,019
That if he'd broken and entered,

29
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,469
He'd be charged for trespassing.

30
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,050
And today

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,809
Melted like wax.

32
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,649
That's how he is, Aunt.

33
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,230
He calls out and everyone yields.

34
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,810
Even his enemies develop empathy for him.

35
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,090
And I'm sure

36
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,560
He'd be in Nano's lap right now.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,840
Like someone from play school.

38
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,921
As if he'd get angry if not given his toy.

39
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:47,752
An infant.

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,410
Like our Daji.

41
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:54,564
She's feeding him breakfast.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,846
You heard that, Neelam?

43
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,531
Nano's feeding him his breakfast.

44
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,299
Stay tuned, Aunt,

45
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,033
For what's coming next.

46
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:19,999
What's coming next?

47
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,609
What do I know?

48
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,799
But what's it to kids

49
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:28,080
Who knows what they'll ask for and when?

50
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:32,300
Tell Nano

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,190
If he asks for something, she has to give it to him.

52
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,689
Alright, I'll disconnect for now.

53
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,459
I'll have my breakfast.

54
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,349
Neelam's made some fine sandwiches.

55
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,099
Club sandwiches.

56
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,332
Eat quickly

57
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:20,609
I've got something important to talk about.

58
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm all ears.

59
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,549
Why not get married?

60
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,280
Why have you stopped like that?

61
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,280
Look at yourself

62
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,391
Your hair have started turning grey.

63
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,642
Do you intend to remain childless even at this age?

64
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,300
No, Dado.

65
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,770
No?

66
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,750
As in?

67
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,889
I don't want to get married.

68
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,280
Why not?

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,699
Just give me one genuine reason.

70
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,447
Whom will I get married to?

71
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,166
Ammi Begum

72
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,677
Someone's calling you.

73
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes, Dastoor Ahmed

74
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:05,450
Here's something for you

75
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,492
Take Wali along, and head for Maheen's.

76
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,491
Maheen's? What's the occasion?

77
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:15,151
It's time for 'Happy New Year', son.

78
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,990
'Happy New Year'?

79
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,391
That's three months away.

80
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:24,360
Why, then, are you asking what the occasion is?

81
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,991
Alright, Ammi Begum.

82
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,650
I'm on my way.

83
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,102
Where to?

84
00:07:30,174 --> 00:07:32,020
Maheen's.

85
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,853
What's the occasion?

86
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,450
'Happy New Year'.

87
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,320
Splendid.

88
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,860
Alright, I'll disconnect.

89
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,990
Get a move on quickly.

90
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,400
Alright.

91
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,229
Yes, so

92
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:19,329
What were you saying?

93
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,240
What was I saying?

94
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:25,099
You were asking

95
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,299
Whom you'd get married to.

96
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:36,802
I have found a girl for you.

97
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,689
Rather, you had found her.

98
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,899
The one

99
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,723
For whom you've come here from France.

100
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:54,666
No, Dado, it's noth --

101
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:55,846
And

102
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,706
For about four years,

103
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,608
She's been seeking you.

104
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:05,336
No, Dado, it's nothing like that.

105
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:10,363
Get in the car, dear.

106
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,263
I don't have the time,

107
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:18,623
Nor you the leisure.

108
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:29,366
When it's time to settle old debts

109
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:33,538
It's just as well that you requite yours.

110
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,156
Greetings, Uncle.

111
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,639
You called upon us suddenly?

112
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,189
Is everything alright?

113
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,698
You look worried --

114
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,256
What happened?

115
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,056
No idea.

116
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:11,497
Ammi Begum called and asked me to get here this instant.

117
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,657
'Happy New Year..'.

118
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,099
'Happy New Year'?

119
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,429
Must be, if she's said it.

120
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,164
'Happy New Year'.

121
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:27,076
Is Nano coming?

122
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,606
No idea.

123
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,156
What do you know then?

124
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,426
She was not in the mood to listen.

125
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:40,156
Why do you think she's called us?

126
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,689
You guess.

127
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,286
I think Nano's here.

128
00:11:22,587 --> 00:11:24,107
Hey

129
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:28,497
What are you looking at like that?

130
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:34,229
I'm not changing my bequest.

131
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:41,760
Whatever I'm leaving everyone, it's as it was.

132
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:52,139
But today,

133
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,169
I've come to ask you for something.

134
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,339
Let me know when you're generous.

135
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,669
At your service, Nano.

136
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:15,903
Bless you.

137
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,679
If you

138
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,681
Said something like this, it'd give me strength.

139
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:26,519
Yes, Nano...

140
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:30,259
You may ask for our heads.

141
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,547
Give your head then.

142
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,796
Return Maheen to me.

143
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:57,473
She's not mentioned in the will,

144
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,143
Thus

145
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:07,469
I've come to say this with you as my witnesses;

146
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,959
Come to think of it

147
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:18,069
Maheen is rightfully Waqar's.

148
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,819
Do a favour and

149
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:34,549
Give Maheen to Waqar.

150
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,449
What are you doing?

151
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,169
I have no objections.

152
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,439
Just ask Maheen.

153
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,139
If so she desires,

154
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,640
You may take her right away.

155
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,790
Where is she?

156
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,710
In her room.

157
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,700
Go.

158
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,781
Ask her.

159
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:30,735
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

160
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:40,233
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

161
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:49,598
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

162
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:59,023
<i>I will remember you then</i>

163
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:08,553
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

164
00:16:08,553 --> 00:16:13,710
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

165
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:18,806
Come in.

166
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,240
Nano's here, Maheen.

167
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:35,316
I know.

168
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,429
She wants you for -- Waqar Ahmed.

169
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,759
She says

170
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,340
As per the settlement, you're rightfully his.

171
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,120
Then --

172
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,159
What did you say?

173
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,070
I cannot say no to her.

174
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
I cannot say no either.

175
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,179
I'd asked you

176
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,289
If this is ultion,

177
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,659
You'd said you were safeguarding;

178
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,780
You'd said I was Waqar Ahmed's treasure in your possession,

179
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,408
I'd said I'm love itself,

180
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,096
And only those get love

181
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:16,516
Who deserve it;

182
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,598
Else in ceremonies of espousal,

183
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:21,976
The girl gets a boy

184
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,286
And the boy gets a girl.

185
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:27,956
One doesn't just get love, Gulrez Akhtar.

186
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,169
Who's it?

187
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,599
It's me.

188
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,100
Neelam.

189
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,919
I'm coming.

190
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,292
Waqar is here, Maheen.

191
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,575
Yes --

192
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,355
I'm coming.

193
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,310
Did you hear that?

194
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:06,249
He's here.

195
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,320
I'm going.

196
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:12,859
Listen.

197
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,860
Promise me.

198
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,060
Yes?

199
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,411
Your wedding procession will be led by my Foxy.

200
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:41,072
Look at this anklet.

201
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,261
Isn't it nice?

202
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,331
And this bindiya [forehead jewel]?

203
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:58,449
Good morning.

204
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,089
Good morning.

205
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,650
Wow.

206
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,420
You've brought jewellery.

207
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,490
Show me this bindiya.

208
00:21:10,641 --> 00:21:11,990
Isn't it beautiful?

209
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,172
Is it just you who liked it?

210
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,470
I'd seen you one day

211
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,019
In Dado's room with a bindiya adorning you.

212
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,079
I'd bought this that day.

213
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,950
And this anklet

214
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,839
Way earlier.

215
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:32,197
I -- I'll be back.

216
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,486
When you wear these,

217
00:21:37,683 --> 00:21:40,135
The clinking will fill the air.

218
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,939
You're trying to win my heart.

219
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,869
I'd won your heart.

220
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,799
But lost the wager as I left.

221
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,729
And now I have no idea how much atonement is due for that moment of perfidy.

222
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,560
You'll get to know about your atonement soon.

223
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,519
Show me the jewellery.

224
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,289
This locket!

225
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,489
It's fabulous.

226
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:19,471
Doesn't it look beautiful!

227
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:24,831
What else have you brought?

228
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,249
I'll bring you whatever you want.

229
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:37,379
A gown just like

230
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:39,660
The one I'd worn that day,

231
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:50,510
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

232
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,480
Those bangles,

233
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,870
Too fragile to touch,

234
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:08,970
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

235
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,991
My bangle's broken...

236
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:04,769
That feeling of exhilaration

237
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,209
That won't let me sleep, that happiness

238
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,200
That I have you,

239
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

240
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,370
And if you can, bring back my eight long years for me...

241
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,339
Those eight years whom nobody asked

242
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,579
How they've gone by.

243
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:39,059
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

244
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,510
Tea's ready.

245
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:11,259
Sunday.

246
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,826
Yes, dear; Sunday night.

247
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,466
She's accepted it.

248
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,256
She's happy with it.

249
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:25,666
She's so lively when she talks.

250
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,196
Tell me

251
00:24:27,196 --> 00:24:28,876
Will you be here?

252
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:31,627
No.

253
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:34,327
Cricket after the marriage, she says.

254
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:39,650
Tell me - you will be here, won't you?

255
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,499
No --

256
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,090
She's said no.

257
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:50,051
She says she'll be here after the wedding.

258
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,499
Why are you saying that?

259
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:01,019
What's with your gang now?

260
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,309
Alright,

261
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:04,980
But remember

262
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,930
She'll miss you.

263
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,920
Both of you. She'll keep asking

264
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,889
Why you're not here.

265
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,829
Alright, talk to Dado.

266
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,096
I'd talked to him; he's not coming.

267
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,236
Have some shame.

268
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:30,876
You've slipped in two English words.

269
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:36,876
Anyways, how are your studies going?

270
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,106
Surely, I will.

271
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:48,246
I'll get back via WhatsApp too.

272
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,468
Sorry, Ammi Begum.

273
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:58,008
There's no Urdu word for 'WhatsApp'.

274
00:25:58,188 --> 00:25:59,538
Anyway, Ali. Disconnect for now.

275
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,798
Ammi Begum's phone is ringing.

276
00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:06,831
Yes, dear.

277
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,949
She wants the same gown.

278
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,139
The same as?

279
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,941
The same as she wore last time.

280
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,401
Great.

281
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,090
Now what do I do with this one?

282
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,330
She's not wearing that one.

283
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,416
Let me talk to her.

284
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:33,116
No Dado, there's nothing to talk about over this.

285
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:35,006
She's said it, and that's it.

286
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,026
Alright.

287
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,966
Disconnect the phone.

288
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:43,776
Bye.

289
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:49,296
Take this gown away.

290
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,337
She doesn't want it.

291
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:56,576
She's said that she'll wear the same one to this wedding as well.

292
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,046
Take it away.

293
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,660
You'll do everything as I desire?

294
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,920
Yes.

295
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,989
You're settling debts.

296
00:27:17,922 --> 00:27:20,501
I'm just trying to make you happy.

297
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm chuffed.

298
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,340
I've been waiting for you for eight years.

299
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,270
Waiting for this Sunday night for eight years.

300
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,240
They say you should never ask lovers

301
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,530
How much they love they have.

302
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,280
For nobody can ever express.

303
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,970
But I can, Waqar Ahmed.

304
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,526
So tell me.

305
00:27:45,526 --> 00:27:48,020
How much do you love me?

306
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:50,140
So much

307
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,890
That Gulrez died

308
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,670
And I lay waiting for you.

309
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,720
That alone is what's good about you.

310
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,300
If one waits for you, you do come in the end.

311
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:15,688
You've never asked me

312
00:28:16,938 --> 00:28:19,858
Since when I've been in love with you.

313
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:25,030
The day you slapped me.

314
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:27,626
That's when.

315
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,240
I was furious then.

316
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,350
But seeing your fingers imprinted on my cheek would melt my heart.

317
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:36,628
Oh?

318
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,846
You used to fight with me over it.

319
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,619
Not with you, Waqar Ahmed.

320
00:28:41,878 --> 00:28:43,678
But with myself.

321
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,987
I was afraid

322
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:50,327
That you may come to know about it.

323
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,926
And when you did come to know,

324
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,820
You slapped me again.

325
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:03,388
If that had been on my face,

326
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:06,388
I'd never have married Gulrez.

327
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:10,598
But the second slap was your departure,

328
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,658
And took along those marks of your fingers.

329
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:20,740
Now go.

330
00:29:20,785 --> 00:29:22,879
Don't meet me before Sunday.

331
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:26,846
I long to meet you too

332
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:29,185
But not now, Waqar Ahmed.

333
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,800
I'll see you on the wedding day itself.

334
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:18,549
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

335
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,606
You've never asked me

336
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:23,926
Since when I've been in love with you.

337
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:27,340
The day you slapped me.

338
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:41,310
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

339
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,829
They say you should never ask lovers

340
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,570
How much they love they have.

341
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,020
So tell me.

342
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,490
How much do you love me?

343
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:43,630
So much

344
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,370
That Gulrez died.

345
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,490
I'm here.

346
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,800
I'd told you you just need to call me.

347
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,779
Why have you come here yourself?

348
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,140
I'm like my Foxy.

349
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,659
I can get up and move any time I want.

350
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:28,410
Come here.

351
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,882
Sit.

352
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,309
Make yourself comfortable here

353
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,859
And talk to me.

354
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,106
Wali says I'll be fine soon.

355
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,191
Yes.

356
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:57,190
What about it?

357
00:31:57,243 --> 00:31:59,770
I know you'll be fine soon.

358
00:32:00,946 --> 00:32:02,866
On the contrary...

359
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:07,497
I'd much rather it go on like this.

360
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,880
I prefer it this way.

361
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,649
You looking at me time and again...

362
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:17,040
Getting scared...

363
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,880
I used to think I'd die for nothing

364
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,429
But now I feel I'll leave you in tears, Maheen...

365
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,670
You'll break those bangles in your grief...

366
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:38,600
Your weeping and wailing will know no bounds...

367
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,379
Truly,

368
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,939
It will be exhilarating...

369
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,119
Shut up!

370
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,830
Hey!

371
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:55,299
Listen.

372
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,220
You --

373
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,399
Why are you all so afraid of dying?

374
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:08,886
And here

375
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:13,606
It was only after I died that I realized

376
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:18,206
Such is life!

377
00:33:21,306 --> 00:33:22,766
Go to sleep.

378
00:33:23,246 --> 00:33:25,306
No, Maheen.

379
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,956
Sleep scares me.

380
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,403
Please come here.

381
00:33:41,592 --> 00:33:43,530
Sit by me.

382
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:57,033
Ask me what I'm looking at.

383
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,099
What are you looking at?

384
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,319
Clicking your photograph.

385
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,989
Ask me how.

386
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,779
How?

387
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,599
When someone gazes their Maheen

388
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,590
Like I am

389
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:21,039
He actually clicks her photograph.

390
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:30,866
But

391
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:35,656
This is the kind that cannot be printed.

392
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:40,516
It remains captured in the eyes.

393
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,629
Now ask

394
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,899
What I will do with your photograph?

395
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,020
What will you do?

396
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,210
I've heard there are houries there.

397
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:03,540
I'll say,

398
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,709
'If there's one like this, alright'.

399
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,940
'Otherwise, stay away'.

400
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:17,232
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

401
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:26,670
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

402
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:36,037
<i>I will remember you then</i>

403
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,380
I hate tears.

404
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:45,588
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

405
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:50,397
<i>And then I will forget you...</i>

406
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:41,037
