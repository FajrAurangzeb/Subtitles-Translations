1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What in the world is your problem, Dado?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think I am?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A blimming circus-monkey who'd dance to your tunes?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think I'd fall in love with Jiya just because you want me to?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd agree to marry her if you forced a ring into her finger?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if hearts beat

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or love by your will!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I said I ain't marrying Jiya, I mean it!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa!
-Dado!
-Ammi Begum!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened? Dado? Dado!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Open your ey --

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call the doctor!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado, I --

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise you -- I'll marry Jiya...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you I will, Dado...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at me, Dado!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some water, Aunt!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you, I'll marry her... I promise you...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's inside.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to her?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it, mate?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray she comes to.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's bad. Real bad.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's struck her heart.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It almost stopped.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's fine now...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't they let me in?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I stopped them.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I figure the last person who said anything to her

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was you.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The last person?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, before she fainted. You said something to her.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She better not see you. Not now.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen someone her age

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So sensitive...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, I'll get going.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you need anything, you know I'm just a call away.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going anywhere.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let you. Not until Dado's fine.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's fine!

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll come to if everything's alright.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's out of danger.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was it?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever did you say to her, mate?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll be fine...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't even think of going in.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bet you folks thought

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's pushing up daisies.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blighter almost had a heart attack.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see in the morning...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be at my feet,

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Agreeing to marry Jiya.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going over to her place tomorrow.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll put the ring on her.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
However do you do it, Ammi Begum!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's got to, Dastoor Ahmed...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the old can't act,

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They get heart attacks for real.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you call it?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
MI.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what his attack almost gave me.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I beat him at his own game.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's outside.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Troubled.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's looking at everyone

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like it's someone to bail him out of the nick!

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cut the apple, would you?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him sit outside like a common criminal. Tell him

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's getting out in the morning.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I crack up the moment he looks at me.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare, you twit.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna ruin everything.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you get

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he marries Jiya?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you doing any of this?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're with me because I love you.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know just as well the kids ain't allowed in here.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not cricket, Nano.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you want him to marry Jiya if he doesn't want to?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him marry whoever he loves.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you want one of them Englishwomen in the house.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya's such a nice girl. We all know her. Plus, she's his friend!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It means something to be friends!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's always something going on!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's cruel.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're siding with him!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you'd side with the enemy!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my enemy. Not yours.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's tormented for you outside.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're enjoying grapes in here.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear that, Mehrunnisa?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, go on?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that you're speaking...

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say something back? Something she deserves?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be honest, girl...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid of him.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says,

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Beware, Kaneez Begum',

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Or this cruel man'

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Will bring the family disgrace'!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Waqar...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like something?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you just have tea all night?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tea.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may leave...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir...

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you so afraid of?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else d'you expect?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She fainted in my arms!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just try thinking out of the box!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't the three of us allowed in?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't go in. That's obvious. You two are kids.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, partner.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't think we're kids.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They think we're on your side!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in,

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which malady

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could heal the moment she'd hear that you're ready to marry Jiya?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not sick.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She gave her word...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Jiya.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think she'd do the same with me?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, no...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What 'no, no'?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do as I want.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't marrying any Jiya for the sake of Ammi Begum's word!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good that I know what she can do now.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, mate.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think she's acting?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone is, I swear!

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see how Munshi Alam quietly turned in?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's the type who'd stay up all night if Ammi Begum has so much as a headache!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has she come to?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what the doctor said, innit?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Uncle...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you say that?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've I done?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I don't know... Caused her to faint!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's next?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell her I'm ready to marry Jiya.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll come to in a moment.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't saying anything.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd go back on your word.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear! For real!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't go back on it.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think carefully about it.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've thought a lot, Uncle Dastoor...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, Jiya ain't that bad.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just thought

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There could be problems

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I don't love her... Yet.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you sure you won't now?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I guess I'm in love with her...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out here, I was thinking why I couldn't fall in love with her.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, I just did.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to go, m'lad!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go tell her!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, Ammi Begum!

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mission a success!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he's ready to marry Jiya!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's fallen for her!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you all happy?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You left the door open, Dastoor Ahmed!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations, Ammi Begum!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he's ready to marry Jiya!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have an affair with Jiya.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with that arrogance and someone else will get her hands on him!

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The handsome twit...

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast, Munshi Alam!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going outside!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him play solo cricket for now...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's enjoy the match...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't going out to play or something.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to the dry cleaner to get Mr Dastoor's clothes.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the devil with his clothes!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one wanders close to that lad!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're sending him to Coventry!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think he has any business there.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, I'm pretty sure he can go on his own if he wants.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you even know what it means to send someone to Coventry, you nyaff?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't someone howling too much?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I still remember your quiet face before your marriage.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost thought you're mute!

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna strike you off the will! You ain't getting a bit of my property, movable or immovable!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If my life is spared, may I speak freely? Something important.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmph!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd say

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something important!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't say unless you've heard it, can you?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he doesn't want to marry Jiya,

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it that hard to ask him

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who he'd rather marry?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if he named some Mary, Jane, or Susie?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd name her.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not get married right away.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To be honest,

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got a point, Ammi Begum.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali's here!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop him!

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let him inside the lawn!

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heya, partner...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see you're up to some solo cricket.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, mate...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado refused to play.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopped Munshi Alam and Aunt too.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are we for?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gonna play cricket first thing you're back from school, eh, you muppet?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've done my duty, Dado.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one can stop me.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd play with this loafer, this wastrel?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a proper knave, I tell you!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way you're playing with this London tramp. C'mon.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, Dado...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember how you'd kiss his picture before he got here?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather spit in his face now.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bonjour, Nano!
[Rhymes with 'ow']

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?
[Rhymes with 'ow']

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(She says hi.)

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, you twit!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Inside!

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast, Nano!

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got a match lined up!

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A proper good one at that! We're playing for 10 gee!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Against?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Him.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd that happen?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He called.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twits decide everything over the phone, don't you?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd disobey me...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And learn gambling from this professional spieler?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We ain't gambling, Nano!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a prize for the winner and a punishment for the loser!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme go already!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the lawyer, Munshi Alam.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm finishing the deed of disownment before their match is finished.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I leave?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the lawyer ASAP.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't stand by you in this crime.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you say?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it, Ammi Begum.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch your mouth, Munshi Alam!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ain't going to the dry cleaner either.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to play cricket in the lawn.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've chipped in 1,000 for the prize too.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You</i>?</i>

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, me.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Nano?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You comin' for the match against him, you twit?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec!

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's challenged me! We're playing for 10 gee!

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He challenged me too.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Playing today is tantamount to staging a coup against Kaneez Begum!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's in on it with him!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the little ones,

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wee kids...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The snakes in the grass are accosting me...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adamant to play today.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to mention

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good old

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter has joined the ranks of the enemy!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough!

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eh?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all up in revolt!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see that...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This calls for some proper politics.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Edicts and decrees don't work in affaires de cœur.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You advising me or telling me

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'm wrong about the kids?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I take the wrong decisions for them?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like that.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just mean -- Don't stand in the way of love.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love doesn't bother how powerful Kaneez Begum can be.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch your tongue, Maheen Aurangzeb.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fear that London tramp.

335
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,588
He schemes more subtly and strikes more savagely than the East India Company!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I look into his eyes every day

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And see through him.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's looking for someone.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll upset your world if you heard her name...

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me if you're playing today.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you are, you better not set foot in here again.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loses his share of my wealth, and you of my love.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Aye?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got your text.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A certain Kaneez Begum was to call.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About your marriage?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was to call yesterday.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about marriage.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Takes time.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can understand.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, if she

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talks to you...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you say?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you send the boy's picture?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could I see his face for once?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need a picture.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be with her.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See him all you want when they visit.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... Alright...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guard! Open the gate!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where to?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in. I'll tell you. Quick.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call you back...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam!

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Neelam?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She left.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright. Go.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her phone's switched off!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boo!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw you coming.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd have some fun.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got a few things to talk about.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That sounds frightening...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare...

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look carefully...

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the more frightened.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what,

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I took you into my lap when you were young.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You slipped and fell on the floor.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got an earful. That's when I started fearing you.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what,

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano says I've got a screw loose

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of the fall!

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you were young...

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looked lovely smiling.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do or die, partner.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum ain't surrendering before this here brat.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd you call a brat?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh...

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get her.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't listen to me.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does as she wants.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmph!

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not good enough.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lose to Maheen and you've won against Ammi Begum.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, get going already!

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring her along!

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her she's got to play this challenge.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like she'd listen to me! Wow...

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd say something that'll make me never want to see her again!

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd say something? Let her.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you took it quietly,

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think she'd be embarrassed?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know her.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't <i>that</i> cruel.</i>

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, partner.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you need our support?

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me the keys --
-Mr Waqar...

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miss Jiya's here.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell her?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell her I'm here?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're outta your mind!

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stark raving mad, all of you!

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what your silence means.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what asking for time means.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what leaving my birthday party means...

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They all know too.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's how we are.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd rather blindfold ourselves

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And hope to walk down the road we dream of.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now, you're the only one who can lead us down it.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to hear my answer?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to give us... Yourself.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I beg you in the name of love.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who doesn't know

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love and life aren't given out of charity.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I like to delude myself

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I can get both.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got the right to refuse, but

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was determined

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To ask in a way

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That'd leave no option.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That'd leave no option.
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i>

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't love him, Neelam.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you did,

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't be begging you here.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be begging to be his instead.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do if I were him and he were me?

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love someone else?

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gone to buy a book

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But felt like buying a perfume instead?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not this time.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the blimmin' book.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just for once...

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a look at one page. Just one page.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you think you made the wrong choice...

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get any perfume you like.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to shoo Jiya away!

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't shoo her away, mate.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said I'm not home.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see her tomorrow.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, know what, Dado called her.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's sent a proposal.

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think?

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She seems only too excited.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think I ought to get married?

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you even know what it means to be 'only too excited'?

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves you.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real!

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your friendship

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was never just that.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was love at first sight!

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd die for you.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh.

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, I'm sorry to say,

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's dead.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But where are we headed?

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd get ladies' perfume and some white flowers first...

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd make peace with Maheen, mate.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I figured conflict's costing me too much.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Making friends with her will sort everything out with Dado.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean it, don't you?

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't you home, Suraiyya?

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm out shopping for groceries.

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get back, you twit!

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The world's about to end!

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Ammi Begum?

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The London tramp, you know?

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and your blasted 'Yeahs'! He's about to make peace with Maheen!

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great news, Ammi Begum!

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're ready to bury the hatchet!

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm putting you on jankers when you're here!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get back right away, you twit!

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop him!

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop him?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell him it's Ammi Begum's orders.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can't see Maheen.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my nephew.

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget everything about it.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget that you even know someone by the name of Waqar.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the love of God, Ammi Begum...

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the love of God, Suraiyya...

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be begging for it if you don't.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rest is up to you.

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what are you doing here?

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just walking by.

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopped when I saw you.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pour my heart into this diary.

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything I can't even tell myself.

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And everything

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always wanted to tell you.

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's yours to read.

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget reading it,

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one else dares even touch it.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why me?

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once you've read it...

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd believe too...

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That when I ask for time...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't really asking you...

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just asking myself...

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've written about Gulrez a lot in my diary.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I want to fall in love with you, Gulrez'.

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I guess I could never.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like -- Someone's jinxed us.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or -- There's a wall between us.

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd tell you if I knew.

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I think

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just my mind... There's no one.

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes or no, I've always thought about Gulrez.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never anyone else.

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There can't be anyone else.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not possible.

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it with you.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't dare touch it either.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take all the time you want in one shot

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And think over it.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He thinks I'm insulting him...

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?
-No...

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says you only need to ask...

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he'd give you a hundred years...

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
