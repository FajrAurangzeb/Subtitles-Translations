1
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,281
What in the world is your problem, Dado?

2
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:15,981
What d'you think I am?

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,908
A blimming circus-monkey who'd dance to your tunes?

4
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,668
D'you think I'd fall in love with Jiya just because you want me to?

5
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:27,418
That I'd agree to marry her if you forced a ring into her finger?

6
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,917
As if hearts beat

7
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:33,138
Or love by your will!

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,568
When I said I ain't marrying Jiya, I mean it!

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,370
Ammi Begum!

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,921
Mehrunnisa!
-Dado!
-Ammi Begum!

11
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,172
What happened? Dado? Dado!

12
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:50,052
Open your ey --

13
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,503
Call the doctor!

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,639
Dado, I --

15
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,947
I promise you -- I'll marry Jiya...

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,462
I swear by you I will, Dado...

17
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,602
Dado...

18
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,370
Look at me, Dado!

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,457
Mum...

20
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:03,407
Get some water, Aunt!

21
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:04,579
Dado?

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,007
Dado...

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:10,479
I swear by you, I'll marry her... I promise you...

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,319
Neelam!

25
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,419
Ammi Begum's inside.

26
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,538
What happened to her?

27
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,049
What is it, mate?

28
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:18,158
Just pray.

29
00:02:18,158 --> 00:02:19,169
What?

30
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,720
Pray she comes to.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,801
It's bad. Real bad.

32
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,018
What are you saying?

33
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:27,429
Someone's struck her heart.

34
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:29,938
It almost stopped.

35
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,249
What?

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,691
She's fine now...

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,748
Why don't they let me in?

38
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,948
I stopped them.

39
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:42,259
Because I figure the last person who said anything to her

40
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,118
Was you.

41
00:02:44,649 --> 00:02:45,998
The last person?

42
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:49,369
As in, before she fainted. You said something to her.

43
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:51,829
Goodness...

44
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,029
She better not see you. Not now.

45
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:58,238
I haven't seen someone her age

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,141
So sensitive...

47
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,618
Anyway, I'll get going.

48
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,090
If you need anything, you know I'm just a call away.

49
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,819
No...

50
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,258
You're not going anywhere.

51
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,018
I won't let you. Not until Dado's fine.

52
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:10,829
She's fine!

53
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,069
She'll come to if everything's alright.

54
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,699
She's out of danger.

55
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:15,500
But...

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,539
But?

57
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,258
What was it?

58
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,809
Whatever did you say to her, mate?

59
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,298
Anyway...

60
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:26,388
Don't worry...

61
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,498
She'll be fine...

62
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,928
But don't even think of going in.

63
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:31,338
I'll get going.

64
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,980
Bet you folks thought

65
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:54,817
Ammi Begum's pushing up daisies.

66
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,418
That blighter almost had a heart attack.

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,368
You'll see in the morning...

68
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:04,668
He'll be at my feet,

69
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,517
Agreeing to marry Jiya.

70
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:09,999
I'm going over to her place tomorrow.

71
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,308
I'll put the ring on her.

72
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,919
However do you do it, Ammi Begum!

73
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,469
Someone's got to, Dastoor Ahmed...

74
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,659
If the old can't act,

75
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,718
They get heart attacks for real.

76
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,598
What d'you call it?

77
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,149
MI.

78
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,549
Hmm.

79
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:45,158
That's what his attack almost gave me.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,958
I beat him at his own game.

81
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,488
He's outside.

82
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:54,738
Troubled.

83
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:57,269
He's looking at everyone

84
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,630
Like it's someone to bail him out of the nick!

85
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,388
Cut the apple, would you?

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,078
Let him...

87
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:09,389
Let him sit outside like a common criminal. Tell him

88
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,072
He's getting out in the morning.

89
00:05:11,072 --> 00:05:14,742
I crack up the moment he looks at me.

90
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,469
Don't you dare, you twit.

91
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,241
You're gonna ruin everything.

92
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,491
What d'you get

93
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,209
If he marries Jiya?

94
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,170
I mean --

95
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,290
Why are you doing any of this?

96
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,911
Shut up...

97
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:34,782
You're with me because I love you.

98
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,411
You know just as well the kids ain't allowed in here.

99
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:39,823
Not cricket, Nano.

100
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,160
Why d'you want him to marry Jiya if he doesn't want to?

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,048
Let him marry whoever he loves.

102
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,438
Okay...

103
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,054
So you want one of them Englishwomen in the house.

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,077
Jiya's such a nice girl. We all know her. Plus, she's his friend!

105
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,001
It means something to be friends!

106
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,531
There's always something going on!

107
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,318
That's cruel.

108
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,908
You're siding with him!

109
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,590
Can't believe you'd side with the enemy!

110
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,570
He's my enemy. Not yours.

111
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,170
He's tormented for you outside.

112
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,951
Can't believe you're enjoying grapes in here.

113
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,307
Hear that, Mehrunnisa?

114
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:25,728
Aye.

115
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,064
Aye, go on?

116
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,213
Now that you're speaking...

117
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:33,943
Why don't you say something back? Something she deserves?

118
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,688
I'll be honest, girl...

119
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,488
I'm afraid of him.

120
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,578
My heart says,

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,541
'Beware, Kaneez Begum',

122
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:53,343
'Or this cruel man'

123
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:57,362
'Will bring the family disgrace'!

124
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,348
M. Waqar...

125
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:42,208
Would you like something?

126
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:43,789
No.

127
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,398
So...

128
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,909
Will you just have tea all night?

129
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,319
Aye.

130
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,144
Just tea.

131
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:55,114
You may leave...

132
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,718
I --

133
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,798
Sir...

134
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,567
What are you so afraid of?

135
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,718
What else d'you expect?

136
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,987
She fainted in my arms!

137
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:11,008
Just try thinking out of the box!

138
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,119
How?

139
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,855
Why aren't the three of us allowed in?

140
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:20,068
I can't go in. That's obvious. You two are kids.

141
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,739
No, partner.

142
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:23,738
They don't think we're kids.

143
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,209
They think we're on your side!

144
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,909
As in?

145
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,960
As in,

146
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,380
Which malady

147
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,030
Could heal the moment she'd hear that you're ready to marry Jiya?

148
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,548
She's not sick.

149
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,268
She gave her word...

150
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,558
To Jiya.

151
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:42,498
Whoa...

152
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,500
D'you think she'd do the same with me?

153
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,668
Jesus...

154
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,928
No, no...

155
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,098
What 'no, no'?

156
00:08:48,098 --> 00:08:49,782
I'll do as I want.

157
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:53,342
I ain't marrying any Jiya for the sake of Ammi Begum's word!

158
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,190
Good that I know what she can do now.

159
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,698
Shut up, mate.

160
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,418
You think she's acting?

161
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,028
Everyone is, I swear!

162
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,929
Did you see how Munshi Alam quietly turned in?

163
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:09,391
He's the type who'd stay up all night if Ammi Begum has so much as a headache!

164
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,559
Has she come to?

165
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,838
She will.

166
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,058
That's what the doctor said, innit?

167
00:09:37,058 --> 00:09:38,489
Please, Uncle...

168
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,579
Why d'you say that?

169
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,331
What've I done?

170
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,061
Oh, I don't know... Caused her to faint!

171
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,059
What's next?

172
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,549
Wait.

173
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,693
Aye?

174
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,838
Go and tell her I'm ready to marry Jiya.

175
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,688
She'll come to in a moment.

176
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:02,998
No.

177
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,768
I ain't saying anything.

178
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,268
You'd go back on your word.

179
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,301
I swear! For real!

180
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:12,580
I won't go back on it.

181
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,958
Think again.

182
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,059
What?

183
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,428
Think carefully about it.

184
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:19,658
I've thought a lot, Uncle Dastoor...

185
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:23,359
Besides, Jiya ain't that bad.

186
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,050
I just thought

187
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,510
There could be problems

188
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,181
Because I don't love her... Yet.

189
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,292
So?

190
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:31,043
Are you sure you won't now?

191
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:32,084
Aye.

192
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,935
Because I guess I'm in love with her...

193
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:34,826
What?

194
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:36,020
I mean it.

195
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,519
Out here, I was thinking why I couldn't fall in love with her.

196
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,649
Guess what, I just did.

197
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,120
Way to go, m'lad!

198
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:46,541
Bless you!

199
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,461
I'll go tell her!

200
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,678
Congratulations!

201
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,069
Congratulations, Ammi Begum!

202
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:14,508
Mission a success!

203
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,259
He said he's ready to marry Jiya!

204
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,940
He's fallen for her!

205
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,618
What?

206
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:38,939
Aren't you all happy?

207
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,010
You left the door open, Dastoor Ahmed!

208
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,701
Just a sec!

209
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,439
Congratulations!

210
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,770
Congratulations, Ammi Begum!

211
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,130
Mission a success!

212
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,021
He said he's ready to marry Jiya!

213
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,891
Maheen...

214
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,400
I don't have an affair with Jiya.

215
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,046
Keep up with that arrogance and someone else will get her hands on him!

216
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:08,298
The twit...

217
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,204
The handsome twit...

218
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,329
Not so fast, Munshi Alam!

219
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,028
You're not going outside!

220
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,159
Let him play solo cricket for now...

221
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,784
Let's enjoy the match...

222
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:01,685
I ain't going out to play or something.

223
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:06,074
I'm going to the dry cleaner to get Mr Dastoor's clothes.

224
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:08,835
To the devil with his clothes!

225
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:14,866
No one wanders close to that lad!

226
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,240
We're sending him to Coventry!

227
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,830
I don't think he has any business there.

228
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,830
Besides, I'm pretty sure he can go on his own if he wants.

229
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,878
D'you even know what it means to send someone to Coventry, you nyaff?

230
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,428
Isn't someone howling too much?

231
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,271
I still remember your quiet face before your marriage.

232
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:52,151
I almost thought you're mute!

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,858
I'm gonna strike you off the will! You ain't getting a bit of my property, movable or immovable!

234
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,431
If my life is spared, may I speak freely? Something important.

235
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:12,521
Hmph!

236
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,398
<i>You</i>'d say

237
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,179
Something important!

238
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:20,860
You can't say unless you've heard it, can you?

239
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,421
Go on.

240
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,141
If he doesn't want to marry Jiya,

241
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,010
Is it that hard to ask him

242
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,180
Who he'd rather marry?

243
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,960
What if he named some Mary, Jane, or Susie?

244
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,058
Aye?

245
00:15:44,228 --> 00:15:45,918
He'd name her.

246
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,039
Not get married right away.

247
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,621
To be honest,

248
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,078
He's got a point, Ammi Begum.

249
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,519
Ammi Begum!

250
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,388
Ali's here!

251
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,298
Quickly!

252
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,769
Stop him!

253
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,752
Don't let him inside the lawn!

254
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,840
Double time!

255
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,168
Aye...

256
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,226
Heya, partner...

257
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,440
I see you're up to some solo cricket.

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,741
No, mate...

259
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,740
Dado refused to play.

260
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,869
Stopped Munshi Alam and Aunt too.

261
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:53,290
What are we for?

262
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,028
Gonna play cricket first thing you're back from school, eh, you muppet?

263
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,779
I've done my duty, Dado.

264
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,750
No one can stop me.

265
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,001
You'd play with this loafer, this wastrel?

266
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:07,524
He's a proper knave, I tell you!

267
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,480
No way you're playing with this London tramp. C'mon.

268
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,450
Whoa, Dado...

269
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,210
Remember how you'd kiss his picture before he got here?

270
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,901
I'd rather spit in his face now.

271
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,640
'Owdy, Nano!

272
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,950
'Ow' what?

273
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,058
(She says hi.)

274
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,058
C'mon, you twit!

275
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,745
Inside!

276
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:29,418
Not so fast, Nano!

277
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:31,088
Got a match lined up!

278
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:33,878
A proper good one at that! We're playing for 10 gee!

279
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,817
Against?

280
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,415
Him.

281
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,702
When'd that happen?

282
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,348
He called.

283
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:48,618
You twits decide everything over the phone, don't you?

284
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,577
You'd disobey me...

285
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:56,057
And learn gambling from this professional spieler?

286
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,627
C'mon.

287
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,550
We ain't gambling, Nano!

288
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,807
It's a prize for the winner and a punishment for the loser!

289
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,297
Lemme go already!

290
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,620
Get the lawyer, Munshi Alam.

291
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,798
I'm finishing the deed of disownment before their match is finished.

292
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,611
May I leave?

293
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:23,113
Get the lawyer ASAP.

294
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,708
No.

295
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,569
I can't stand by you in this crime.

296
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,488
What'd you say?

297
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,372
I mean it, Ammi Begum.

298
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,850
Watch your mouth, Munshi Alam!

299
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,579
You ain't going to the dry cleaner either.

300
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm not.

301
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm going to play cricket in the lawn.

302
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,921
I've chipped in 1,000 for the prize too.

303
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,570
<i>You</i>?

304
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,049
Aye, me.

305
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,659
Aye, Nano?

306
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,059
You comin' for the match against him, you twit?

307
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,841
Just a sec!

308
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:55,112
He's challenged me! We're playing for 10 gee!

309
00:19:55,372 --> 00:19:58,403
He challenged me too.

310
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Playing today is tantamount to staging a coup against Kaneez Begum!

311
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,610
Really?

312
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,550
Everyone's in on it with him!

313
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,017
And the little ones,

314
00:20:14,017 --> 00:20:16,417
The wee kids...

315
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:21,107
The snakes in the grass are accosting me...

316
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,255
Adamant to play today.

317
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,907
Not to mention

318
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:28,584
Good old

319
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:30,446
Munshi Alam.

320
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,793
The blighter has joined the ranks of the enemy!

321
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,127
Fair enough!

322
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,030
Eh?

323
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,967
They're all up in revolt!

324
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,567
Aye...

325
00:20:44,907 --> 00:20:46,770
I can see that...

326
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,168
This calls for some proper politics.

327
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,987
Edicts and decrees don't work in affaires de cœur.

328
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:57,130
You advising me or telling me

329
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,410
That I'm wrong about the kids?

330
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,586
That I take the wrong decisions for them?

331
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,427
It's not like that.

332
00:21:06,427 --> 00:21:09,376
I just mean -- Don't stand in the way of love.

333
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:12,927
Love doesn't bother how powerful Kaneez Begum can be.

334
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:16,197
Watch your tongue, Maheen Aurangzeb.

335
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:20,337
Fear that London tramp.

336
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:27,430
He schemes more subtly and strikes more savagely than the East India Company!

337
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,907
I look into his eyes every day

338
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,918
And see through him.

339
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,871
The blighter's looking for someone.

340
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,420
Who?

341
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:46,361
It'll upset your world if you heard her name...

342
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,228
Just tell me if you're playing today.

343
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:58,773
If you are, you better not set foot in here again.

344
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:05,808
He loses his share of my wealth, and you of my love.

345
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,798
Hello? Aye?

346
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:55,990
I got your text.

347
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:59,049
A certain Kaneez Begum was to call.

348
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:00,560
Maybe

349
00:23:00,621 --> 00:23:02,992
About your marriage?

350
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,132
So?

351
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,888
She...

352
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,828
Didn't.

353
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,649
She will.

354
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,228
Okay.

355
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:13,929
I thought

356
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:15,958
She was to call yesterday.

357
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,048
It's about marriage.

358
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,171
Takes time.

359
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,071
Aye.

360
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:28,061
I can understand.

361
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,821
Okay, if she

362
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:33,120
Talks to you...

363
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,431
What'd you say?

364
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:37,322
I'll say

365
00:23:37,513 --> 00:23:39,313
I accept.

366
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,538
Fine.

367
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,558
By the way...

368
00:23:45,788 --> 00:23:48,768
Could you send the boy's picture?

369
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,529
Could I see his face for once?

370
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,419
You don't need a picture.

371
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,249
He'll be with her.

372
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,849
See him all you want when they visit.

373
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:59,091
Okay... A -- Alright...

374
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,499
Okay.

375
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:02,169
Bye.

376
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,038
Guard! Open the gate!

377
00:24:27,698 --> 00:24:28,948
C'mon.

378
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,689
Where to?

379
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,331
Get in. I'll tell you. Quick.

380
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,312
I'll call you back...

381
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,178
Neelam!

382
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,070
Neelam?

383
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,238
Monsieur?

384
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,378
Where's Neelam?

385
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:51,419
Madame just left.

386
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:52,715
For?

387
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,389
No idea.

388
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,828
Alright. Go.

389
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,928
Her phone's switched off!

390
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,448
Maheen!

391
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,080
Maheen!

392
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,468
Boo!

393
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,310
I saw you coming.

394
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,258
Thought I'd have some fun.

395
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,101
You better not.

396
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,798
We've got a few things to talk about.

397
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:12,048
Whoa...

398
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:14,469
That sounds frightening...

399
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,439
I wouldn't dare...

400
00:26:17,804 --> 00:26:19,749
Look carefully...

401
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,477
I'm the more frightened.

402
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,909
Know what,

403
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,620
I took you into my lap when you were young.

404
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,110
You slipped and fell on the floor.

405
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:34,599
I got an earful. That's when I started fearing you.

406
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,699
Guess what,

407
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:38,760
Nano says I've got a screw loose

408
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,978
Because of the fall!

409
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,919
What are you looking at?

410
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,910
When you were young...

411
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,558
You always...

412
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,461
Looked lovely smiling.

413
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,200
Do or die, partner.

414
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,630
Ammi Begum ain't surrendering before this here brat.

415
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,082
Who'd you call a brat?

416
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,881
Ooh...

417
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,561
I get it.

418
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,208
Go.

419
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:20,558
Get her.

420
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:21,603
Very funny.

421
00:27:21,603 --> 00:27:23,338
She doesn't listen to me.

422
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:25,630
She does as she wants.

423
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,658
Hmph!

424
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,318
Not good enough.

425
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:31,149
Lose to Maheen and you've won against Ammi Begum.

426
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,400
What?

427
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,739
I mean, get going already!

428
00:27:34,739 --> 00:27:36,729
Bring her along!

429
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:39,550
Tell her she's got to play this challenge.

430
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,769
Like she'd listen to me! Wow...

431
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,711
She'd say something that'll make me never want to see her again!

432
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:47,541
She'd say something?

433
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,212
Just...

434
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:49,323
Let her.

435
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:51,493
If you took it quietly,

436
00:27:51,493 --> 00:27:53,904
Don't you think she'd be embarrassed?

437
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:56,395
I know her.

438
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,876
She ain't <i>that</i> cruel.

439
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:01,266
Okay.

440
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:02,958
Come with me?

441
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,760
C'mon, partner.

442
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,017
Why d'you need our support?

443
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,360
Get me the keys --
-M. Waqar...

444
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,701
Mlle Jiya's here.

445
00:28:12,701 --> 00:28:14,346
What do I tell her?

446
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,811
Did you tell her I'm here?

447
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,390
You're outta your mind!

448
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,718
Stark raving mad, all of you!

449
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,489
I...

450
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,898
I know what your silence means.

451
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,128
I know what asking for time means.

452
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:44,041
I know what leaving my birthday party means...

453
00:28:44,488 --> 00:28:47,039
They all know too.

454
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,419
But that's how we are.

455
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,220
We'd rather blindfold ourselves

456
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,680
Hoping to walk down the road we dream of.

457
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,899
Right now, you're the only one who can lead us down it.

458
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:07,229
You want to hear my answer?

459
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,508
I want you to give us... Yourself.

460
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,438
I beg you in the name of love.

461
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,868
Who doesn't know

462
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,860
Love and life aren't given out of charity.

463
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,888
But I like to delude myself

464
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:37,578
That I can get both.

465
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,198
You've got the right to refuse, but

466
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,219
I was determined

467
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,839
To ask in a way

468
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:51,580
That'd leave no option.

469
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,621
That'd leave no option.
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

470

I don't love him, Neelam.

474
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,758
If you did,

475
00:30:28,388 --> 00:30:30,709
I wouldn't be begging you here.

476
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,370
<i>You</i>'d be begging to be his instead.

477
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,481
Alright,

478
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:46,485
What'd you do if I were him and he were me?

479
00:30:46,485 --> 00:30:48,946
You love someone else?

480
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:51,476
No.

481
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,178
Alright...

482
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:57,439
So...

483
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,051
Ever

484
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,890
Gone to buy a book

485
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,051
But felt like buying a perfume instead?

486
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,889
Aye...

487
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,841
Not this time.

488
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,288
Get the blimmin' book.

489
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,482
Just for once...

490
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,011
Have a look at one page. Just one page.

491
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,717
If you think you made the wrong choice...

492
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,941
Get any perfume you like.

493
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,208
Wow...

494
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,468
Way to shoo Jiya away!

495
00:31:40,468 --> 00:31:42,399
I didn't shoo her away, mate.

496
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:43,909
I said I'm not home.

497
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:45,719
I'll see her tomorrow.

498
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,138
By the way, know what, Dado called her.

499
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:52,003
She's sent a proposal.

500
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,377
What?

501
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:55,130
You heard me.

502
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,061
What'd she say?

503
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,640
What d'you think?

504
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,270
She seems only too excited.

505
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,788
Blimey.

506
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,078
What?

507
00:32:03,078 --> 00:32:05,518
Don't you think I ought to get married?

508
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,378
D'you even know what it means to be 'only too excited'?

509
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,948
Go on.

510
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,898
She loves you.

511
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,953
Oh, please.

512
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,020
For real!

513
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,158
Your friendship

514
00:32:20,158 --> 00:32:21,958
Was never just that.

515
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,149
It was love at first sight!

516
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,990
She'd die for you.

517
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,409
Ooh.

518
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,940
Then, I'm sorry to say,

519
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,537
She's dead.

520
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,988
But where are we headed?

521
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,180
We'd get ladies' perfume and some white flowers first...

522
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,778
Why?

523
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,878
Well...

524
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:52,398
I thought I'd make peace with Maheen, mate.

525
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:53,688
Really?

526
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:54,838
Aye.

527
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,829
I figured conflict's costing me too much.

528
00:32:58,003 --> 00:33:00,866
Making friends with her will sort everything out with Dado.

529
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,827
You mean it, don't you?

530
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,838
I mean it.

531
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,198
Yes!

532
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,891
Why aren't you home, Suraiyya?

533
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,328
I'm out shopping for groceries.

534
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:17,853
Get back, you twit!

535
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,133
The world's about to end!

536
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,255
What happened, Ammi Begum?

537
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:26,010
The London tramp, you know?

538
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,310
Yeah?

539
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:28,820
Me giddy Aunt...

540
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,008
You and your blasted 'Yeahs'! He's about to make peace with Maheen!

541
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:35,369
That's great news, Ammi Begum!

542
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,999
They're ready to bury the hatchet!

543
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:43,831
I'm putting you on jankers when you're here!

544
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,319
Get back right away, you twit!

545
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:50,109
Stop him!

546
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,800
Stop him?

547
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:55,064
Just tell him it's Ammi Begum's orders.

548
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:58,335
He can't see Maheen.

549
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,105
What are you saying?

550
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,619
He's my nephew.

551
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:04,116
Forget everything about it.

552
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:10,176
Forget that you even know someone by the name of Waqar.

553
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,952
For the love of God, Ammi Begum...

554
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:16,450
For the love of God, Suraiyya...

555
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:20,389
You'd be begging for it if you don't.

556
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,310
The rest is up to you.

557
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,758
Wonder what <i>you</i> are doing here...

558
00:34:28,758 --> 00:34:30,161
Just walking by.

559
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:32,253
Stopped when I saw you.

560
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,681
Good.

561
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,736
Go.

562
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,001
Sit.

563
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,388
Here.

564
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,590
I pour my heart into this diary.

565
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,633
Everything I can't even tell myself.

566
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,899
And everything

567
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:11,629
I've always wanted to tell you.

568
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,469
It's yours to read.

569
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:21,779
Forget reading it,

570
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,169
No one else dares even touch it.

571
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,979
Why me?

572
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,340
Once you've read it...

573
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,231
You'd believe too...

574
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,480
That when I ask for time...

575
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,848
I ain't really asking you...

576
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,579
I'm just asking myself...

577
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,948
I've written about Gulrez a lot in my diary.

578
00:35:45,498 --> 00:35:48,539
'I want to fall in love with you, Gulrez'.

579
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,829
But I guess I never could...

580
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,099
Like -- Someone's jinxed us.

581
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,048
Or -- There's a wall between us.

582
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:02,429
Who?

583
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,949
I'd tell you if I knew.

584
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,988
But I think

585
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,412
It's just my mind... There's no one.

586
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,510
Yes or no, I've always thought about Gulrez.

587
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,811
Never anyone else.

588
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,918
There can't <i>be</i> anyone else.

589
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,671
Not possible.

590
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,948
Here.

591
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,549
Keep it with you.

592
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,858
I don't dare touch it either.

593
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:46,430
Take all the time you want

594
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,850
In one shot

595
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,748
And think over it.

596
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,168
He thinks I'm insulting him...

597
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:01,970
Innit?
-No...

598
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,838
He says you only need to ask...

599
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:10,850
And he'd give you a hundred years...

600
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
