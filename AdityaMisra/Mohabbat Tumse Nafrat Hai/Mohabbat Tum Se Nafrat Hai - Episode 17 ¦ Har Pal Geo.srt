1
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,579
Will you come?

2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,929
Tell me honestly.

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,350
You won't betray me, would you?

4
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:28,403
Done?

5
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,374
You'll see

6
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:46,445
I rise in stature the day you don't start.

7
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,653
Everything that had been planned for the day get scrapped.

8
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:17,871
What are you doing?

9
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,652
I thought I'd find out

10
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,881
How today's going to go.

11
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,522
Don't go to the office today.

12
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,376
This is what's wrong with you folks.

13
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:35,137
You take a leave in moments of merriment,

14
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,337
As you do in moments of grief.

15
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:44,687
This, Neelam, is well and truly submitting to grief on your knees.

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,850
Think about it -

17
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,899
I couldn't get her, but got the grief of not getting her.

18
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:55,918
So what's the price of this grief?

19
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,259
Now, would a Scrooge such as myself

20
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,909
Let so valuable a sorrow go by him?

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,501
Shall I go now?

22
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:21,701
Go.

23
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,461
Shall I start the Foxy?

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,850
Start it.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD HERE

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry with me, aren't you?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very happy.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be eager to slap me on my face.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know why I've brought you to this secluded spot?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you can slap me hard.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will be able to vent your anger,

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leaving my esteem untarnished.

35
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,028
I know I've hurt you.

36
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,949
I also know that the curse of a broken heart is baneful.

37
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,710
I'm not stopping you from cursing me,

38
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,141
But I'm innocent, Gulrez...

39
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,980
I've played life like a cricket match in my ignorance.

40
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,840
You're not bad at winning me a match,

41
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:28,701
But my heart said

42
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,041
That he should be the one to lead me to victory.

43
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,321
So,

44
00:19:35,792 --> 00:19:37,712
I've not picked you for my team.

45
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,350
Now,

46
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:46,100
Do you forgive me or will you slap me?

47
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:57,241
Why are you smiling?

48
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,602
Who apologises in love?

49
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:03,102
You never apologise

50
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,262
To one you've never loved.

51
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:07,925
And --

52
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:11,245
About all your insult? What about that?

53
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:13,025
I'd written you a letter

54
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,195
That you never give me woe,

55
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:21,676
For I can endure it.

56
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:28,541
I've hurt you so much --

57
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,865
So bad...

58
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,695
Please forgive me...

59
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:37,915
Again?

60
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:42,516
I feel I'd not be able to meet your gaze if I'm married to anyone else...

61
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:44,994
What do you mean, 'anyone else?'

62
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,794
You're talking about Waqar.

63
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,654
Why not name him?

64
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,100
Actually, I've not really decided...

65
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:02,880
I just feel -- It could be him...

66
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:10,122
You glunterpeck! He's an all-rounder!

67
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,952
Your team won't do without him.

68
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,672
Let's go out to lunch.

69
00:21:20,637 --> 00:21:21,578
Lunch?

70
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:25,118
I thought I'd give you a treat from the gang's fund if you didn't slap me.

71
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,258
Come!

72
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,377
Right here, my friends!

73
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,957
Enjoy yourselves!

74
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:58,097
What's this? 'Enjoy ourselves' on these bleeding 200 Rupees? Keep them!

75
00:21:58,328 --> 00:21:59,779
How much more do you want?

76
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,268
500.

77
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:05,698
I've called you 'friends.' You folks should be ashamed of yourselves, demanding money like that!

78
00:22:05,698 --> 00:22:06,968
Get lost!

79
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,720
Where did you get this Foxy?

80
00:22:11,724 --> 00:22:13,284
Gulrez gave it to me.

81
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:16,204
Gulrez gave you?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With Maheen.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not 'what,' ask 'why!'

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, why has he gone with her?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are they up to this time?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter shouldn't reply to a greeting of hers after everything that happened last night!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't reply to her greeting,

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For she never greeted him.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopped the car, bossed around, and took him with her.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where did she take him?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Somewhere she could apologise, and Gulrez would promptly say, 'I forgive you!'

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So now she'll apologise to him.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD HERE

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
