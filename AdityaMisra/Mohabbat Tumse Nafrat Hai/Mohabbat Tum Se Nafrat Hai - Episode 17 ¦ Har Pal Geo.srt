1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you come?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me honestly.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't betray me, would you?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I rise in stature the day you don't start.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything that had been planned for the day get scrapped.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd find out

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How today's going to go.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go to the office today.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is what's wrong with you folks.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take a leave in moments of merriment,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you do in moments of grief.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This, Neelam, is well and truly submitting to grief on your knees.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about it -

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't get her, but got the grief of not getting her.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what's the price of this grief?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, would a Scrooge such as myself

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let so valuable a sorrow go by him?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall I go now?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall I start the Foxy?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Start it.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your mother, Jiya...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother who, by the time you get to hear this,

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is quite possibly no longer around...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The doctors are trying their best,

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the more they try,

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The more I pray

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They fail...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After I'm gone, I know

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna face the disgrace I did...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows,

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time you find out the truth,

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may have begun to hate me too...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The truth, my little doll...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is... I'm innocent...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aurangzeb... My friend from college...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always wanted to marry him.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always, as in...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When your Dad was nowhere in the picture.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't get Aurangzeb... So...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like every other girl in such a situation, I gave in to my parents' will.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how I got married to your Dad.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come out.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here to see you.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says she shouldn't have created a scene before everyone.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What should she have done?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I say? Why don't you ask her yourself?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's blocking the road.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her to move the car aside.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta get off

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And listen to her.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't talking to her.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? You gonna curse her now?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like my type could curse anyone!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can swear if you want.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't coming.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Says he won't talk.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare he?
-Hold your horses, Maheen! Let him have his way here!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a worse politician than Nano... Left the Government and joined the Opposition in a sec!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, guess what, Gulrez is now the Opposition. Because you toppled his Government last night.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On your feet.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in the Foxy and stay on our tail!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drive!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will it start?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We were living quite a happy life

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When, seven years later,

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A ghost from the past

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Came knocking...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was startled to see him,

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he'd grown too close to your Dad.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I had been so stupid

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To do as I'd been told

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And hide my past

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From my husband.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd come to our place regularly.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never mentioned anything about our past in the beginning,

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Things changed some 8 or 10 months later

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When he begun to remind me

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of our solemn oaths as unsuccessful lovers back in the day...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I put on my guard,

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But could never muster the courage to tell your Dad...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, one day, he came to see me when your Dad was not around...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I kicked him out.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, after a few days,

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He broke in again.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unfortunately for me,

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad was not around again.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But he was furious.</i>

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if he had a right over me!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He showed me my old letters

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tried to blackmail me.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said I didn't care,

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I wouldn't hesitate to tell my husband about everything if I had to.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's when he lost it.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He seized my hand.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pushed him away and struck him with a vase,

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But by then, a car had stopped outside...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He made a run for it, rubbing his face,

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But - curse my luck -

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad had seen him...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Back to it!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quit bummin' around!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much further are we going?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme catch my breath!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going through it all... It was almost like... I lost my mind...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could never imagine Aurangzeb doing any of it... Not least to me!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was startled to see your Dad walk in.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It felt like being caught red-handed.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He asked questions

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I said whatever I came up with.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was the moment

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ruined my life

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forever.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time I came to,

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was at my parents'.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad had begun investigating...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And - curse my luck -

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The man he went to

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was none other than

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aurangzeb.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To cover for himself,

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He presented your Dad with a bunch of my letters as proof of my betrayal...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saying I'd written them after our marriage...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, Jiya...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget writing letters...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never even thought of him after my marriage...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish your Dad had come to me with those letters

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I could tell him

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That he had written them.</i>

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was an expert at it...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He could copy anyone's handwriting.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd used my letters to write new ones to serve his purpose.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blame was all mine as your Dad just saw the handwriting

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And sent me

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Divorce papers...

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know why he was with me

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the day of the accident?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had convinced him

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After much begging

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To tell your Dad the truth... And confess his sins...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To tell your Dad... That I was innocent...

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when fate strikes,

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills you off

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where you don't get an ounce of relief...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had an accident

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And died right there...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He died, Jiya...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But robbed my life of everything...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could be more unfortunate

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Than a woman whose husband bears not her pall,

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor sheds a tear at her grave...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am that woman today.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May God protect you. Always.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you see your Dad,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he could weep for me at my grave someday.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps his tears would be able to wash the blot on my name...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry with me, aren't you?

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very happy.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be eager to slap me on my face.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know why I've brought you to this secluded spot?

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you can slap me hard.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will be able to vent your anger,

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leaving my esteem untarnished.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know I've hurt you.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I also know that the curse of a broken heart is baneful.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm not stopping you from cursing me...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I'm saying, Gulrez, is... I'm innocent...

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've played life like a cricket match in my ignorance.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not bad at winning me a match,

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart said

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he should be the one to lead me to victory.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You couldn't make the team.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now,

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you forgive me or will you slap me?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you smiling?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who apologises in love?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You never apologise

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To one you've never loved.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About all your insult? What about that?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd written you a letter...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Never give me woe,'

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'For I can endure it.'

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've hurt you so much --

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So bad...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please forgive me...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Again?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel I'd never be able to meet your gaze if I'm married to anyone else...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, 'anyone else'?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're talking about Waqar.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not name him?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, I haven't really decided...

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- It could be him...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You glunterpeck! He's an all-rounder!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your team won't do without him.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go out to lunch.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lunch?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd give you a treat from the gang's fund if you didn't slap me.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here, my friends!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enjoy yourselves!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this? 'Enjoy ourselves' on these bleeding 200 Rupees? Keep them!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much do you want?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
500.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've called you 'friends'. You folks should be ashamed of yourselves, demanding money like that!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bugger off!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where did you get this Foxy?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez gave it to me.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez gave you?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With Maheen.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not 'what,' ask 'why!'

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, why'd he go with her?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are they up to this time?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He shouldn't even greet that blighter back after everything that happened last night!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't greet her back,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because she never greeted him.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She stopped the car, bossed around, and took him with her.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But where?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Somewhere she could apologise, and Gulrez would say with terror in his eyes, 'I forgive you!'

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So now she'll apologise to him.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he'll forgive her!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shouldn't he?
-No way!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give us our 200.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bout time you wised up! Here!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Naff off already!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, like, ever?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke the engagement last night, but you're seeing him today!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you're up to?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you want this time?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to say sorry.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't remember you saying sorry to us.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But first, I had to apologise to his broken heart.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our hearts are broken too.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mine... Ammi Begum's...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor and Mehrunnisa left this place in disgrace!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's heart is broken here.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're just... Troubled by the fact they couldn't keep their word from years ago.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd decided last night

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I won't slaughter my heart with my silence for someone's promise...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait!

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Went home.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way he's going home.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum would break his legs!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Gulrez.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm asking about the blighter.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I know?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd that happen?

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you do with this phone? Scratch your head?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you've talked... Found out everything... Got word he's safe wherever he is.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, again, where is he?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter must've gone in hiding! But don't worry... There's no place Ammi Begum can't reach!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not his fault, really. I bet he didn't have the foggiest I'd stop him.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dare him to set foot here.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, he won't.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't he coming here with a proposal?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Why does everyone think there's something going on between us?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good heavens, girl...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke your engagement,

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopped him from leaving...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else should we wait for before we think you're interested in him?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm really sure about it...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The weirdest thing - that's what Gulrez thought too...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send her to blasted Coventry!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coventry?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. She's not going anywhere. Not even to University.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, but what's that gonna achieve?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Confiscate her phone,

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you have to, cut the landline cable!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll fight back against this tyranny with obstinacy.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Precautions, my dear, are not tyranny.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's what she'd think!

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who cares what she thinks?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she starts arguing about it,

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her that for what she's done to our family,

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Generations to come would never forgive her.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are we clear?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember, Suraiyya...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If love like hers ever got to win,

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elders such as ourselves would be left getting the groceries like servants.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Evidently...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lock her room?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lock her room?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, for real?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let her out

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until she changes her mind

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And heart...

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the twit?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even mention his name...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's in town or gone for good.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one knows

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's in hiding or gone.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not going back.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know the force that's stopping him.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just a puny little girl, that sissy.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember the last time she keeled over while bowling?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone get some sense into him.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him what I'm talking about.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's talking about the force of love.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never said they love each other.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you talk about love, don't you dare talk about anyone but Gulrez!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves her...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because why not?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's his fiancée... Always has been!

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sort it out myself...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Find out about the blighter...

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And make it clear to him

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it's best for his health

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he leave this place!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
London?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can go to hell, for all I care!

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By that logic, Maheen ought to go to hell too...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She's more guilty.</i>

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd got engaged!

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to have thought about it!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's under his spell!

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter knows every wicked English trick in the book... He knows how to get the girls under his spell!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be good if we found out by the evening.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or, I've decided...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A declaration of disownment published in the newspapers tomorrow.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I never wanted to send him to London...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart said if he stayed there,

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd learn the wicked ways of the blimmin' East India Company.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you read her feelings?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feelings?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's missing him.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can do anything when she's furious, Jiya.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd slit our throats to keep her word.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Disappear. Right now.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be left all alone.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not afraid of her.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She is, mate...

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I know she's very brave.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very daring.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange, Waqar...

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>If she were that serious about you...</i>

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd she have to put up this act with the engagement and all?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She could've said all of this way back...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor Gulrez...

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine what he'd be going through.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must be on the rack.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so insulting.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, mate.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...
-But?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, you've got an answer ready!

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought people feared breaking hearts...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never knew you'd be so ready to justify it!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the problem with all the winners.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Triumph blinds them

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To everything those who lose have to go through.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I care about Gulrez too.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurts me to think

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That our union would break him.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you meet?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez, of course.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just see him.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check out what losers in love look like.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see him.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say sorry too.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd snatch his Maheen for just a puny little sorry and slip away sharpish?

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's a tip -

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Never see him again.</i>

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're confusing me, Jiya.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seem to forget that Maheen and I have the right to love as much as Gulrez.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mocking me for breaking a heart.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if I broke two?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yours and hers?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever care to check

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's actually in love or just taking you for a ride?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Jiya, we're friends.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'm saying it.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know her better than you.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't speak the truth.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But aye, I wouldn't say the same about her diary...

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scared?

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She broke her engagement for you.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Called you to stop you.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Says a lot about who she'd write about.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But still...

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before you meet your love for the first time...

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go see Gulrez.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just once? To ease him, you know.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I will.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although it hurts me...

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm ashamed, really...

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what I'm gonna say to him...

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'll see him.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
