1
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,698
You comin'?

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,838
Tell me honestly.

3
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,368
You won't betray me, would you?

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,290
Done?

5
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,199
You'll see

6
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:46,329
I rise in stature the day you don't start.

7
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,785
Everything that had been planned for the day gets scrapped.

8
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:17,831
What are you doing?

9
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,500
I thought I'd find out

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,300
How today's going to go.

11
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,861
Don't go to the office today.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,831
This is what's wrong with you folks.

13
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:34,913
You take a leave in moments of merriment,

14
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:37,783
As you do in moments of grief.

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,893
This, Neelam, is well and truly submitting to grief on your knees.

16
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,878
Think about it -

17
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:53,638
I couldn't get her, but got the grief of not getting her.

18
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,262
So what's the price of this grief?

19
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:00,372
Now, would a Scrooge such as myself

20
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:03,892
Let so valuable a sorrow go by him?

21
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,698
Shall I go now?

22
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,218
Go.

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,318
Shall I start the Foxy?

24
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,700
Start it.

25
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,608
Dad?

26
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,984
What happened?

27
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,848
I'm your mother, Jiya...

28
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,127
Your mother who, by the time you get to hear this,

29
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:15,660
Is quite possibly no longer around...

30
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:20,347
The doctors are trying their best,

31
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,258
But the more they try,

32
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,558
The more I pray

33
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,058
They fail...

34
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:36,560
After I'm gone, I know

35
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,330
You're gonna face the disgrace I did...

36
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,899
Who knows,

37
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,618
By the time you find out the truth,

38
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:55,969
You may have begun to hate me too...

39
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,599
The truth, my little doll...

40
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:02,883
Is... I'm innocent...

41
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,179
Aurangzeb... My friend from University...

42
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:17,528
I always wanted to marry him.

43
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,268
Always, as in...

44
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,112
When your Dad was nowhere in the picture.

45
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:34,541
I couldn't get Aurangzeb... So...

46
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:44,222
Like every other girl in such a situation, I gave in to my parents' will.

47
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:48,801
That's how I got married to your Dad.

48
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,839
Come out.

49
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,361
Why?

50
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,919
She's here to see you.

51
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:29,619
But why?

52
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,929
She says she shouldn't have created a scene before everyone.

53
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,280
What should she have done?

54
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,988
What can I say? Why don't you ask her yourself?

55
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,797
She's blocking the road.

56
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:51,928
Tell her to move the car aside.

57
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,459
She won't.

58
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,999
You gotta get off

59
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,969
And listen to her.

60
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,929
I ain't talking to her.

61
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,391
What? You gonna curse her now?

62
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,858
Like my type could curse anyone!

63
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,298
I can swear if you want.

64
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,058
He ain't coming.

65
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:21,389
Why?

66
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,521
Says he won't talk.

67
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,918
How dare he?
-Hold your horses, Maheen! Let him have his way here!

68
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,448
You're a worse politician than Nano... Left the Government and joined the Opposition in a sec!

69
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:40,898
Well, guess what, Gulrez is now the Opposition. Because you toppled his Government last night.

70
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,990
On your feet.

71
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,108
C'mon.

72
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,249
Double time.

73
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,281
Get in the Foxy and stay on our tail!

74
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,500
And you...

75
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,050
Drive!

76
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,708
Will it start?

77
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,858
Yeah.

78
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,509
Why not?

79
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,308
We were living quite a happy life

80
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,700
When, seven years later,

81
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,418
A ghost from the past

82
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:23,148
Came knocking...

83
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:27,520
I was startled to see him,

84
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:34,188
But he'd grown too close to your Dad.

85
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,872
And I had been so stupid

86
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:40,898
To do as I'd been told

87
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:42,972
And hide my past

88
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:47,155
From my husband.

89
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:52,245
He'd come to our place regularly.

90
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:58,995
He never mentioned anything about our past in the beginning,

91
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,635
But...

92
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,770
Things changed some 8 or 10 months later

93
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,000
When he begun to remind me

94
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,700
Of our solemn oaths as unsuccessful lovers back in the day...

95
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,218
I put on my guard,

96
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,689
But could never muster the courage to tell your Dad...

97
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:31,258
Then, one day, he came to see me when your Dad was not around...

98
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,308
I kicked him out.

99
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,322
But, after a few days,

100
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,968
He broke in again.

101
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,540
Unfortunately for me,

102
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:51,013
Your Dad was not around again.

103
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:55,472
But <i>he</i> was furious.

104
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,548
As if he had a right over me!

105
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:03,561
He showed me my old letters

106
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:06,930
And tried to blackmail me.

107
00:11:07,728 --> 00:11:13,478
I said I didn't care,

108
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:20,848
And I wouldn't hesitate to tell my husband about everything if I had to.

109
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,267
That's when he lost it.

110
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:29,830
He seized my hand.

111
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:35,889
I pushed him away and struck him with a vase,

112
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:43,028
But by then, a car had stopped outside...

113
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:49,359
He made a run for it, rubbing his face,

114
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,098
But - curse my luck -

115
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,756
Your Dad had seen him...

116
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,483
C'mon! Back to it!

117
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,038
Quit bummin' around!

118
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:33,098
How much further are we going?

119
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:35,139
Lemme catch me breath!

120
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:54,045
Going through it all... It was almost like... I lost my mind...

121
00:12:54,599 --> 00:13:03,179
I could never imagine Aurangzeb doing any of it... Not least to me!

122
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:10,258
I was startled to see your Dad walk in.

123
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:16,379
It felt like being caught red-handed.

124
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,988
He asked questions

125
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,188
And I said whatever I came up with.

126
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:27,350
That was the moment

127
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
That ruined my life

128
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,912
Forever.

129
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,567
By the time I came to,

130
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,037
I was at my parents'.

131
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:46,033
Your Dad had begun investigating...

132
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,628
And - curse my luck -

133
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:52,177
The man he went to

134
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,841
Was none other than

135
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:58,272
Aurangzeb.

136
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:02,632
To cover for himself,

137
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:13,039
He presented your Dad with a bunch of my letters as proof of my betrayal...

138
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:21,828
Saying I'd written them after our marriage...

139
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:24,889
I swear, Jiya...

140
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,901
Forget writing letters...

141
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:33,040
I never even thought of him after my marriage...

142
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,791
I wish your Dad had come to me with those letters

143
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,101
So I could tell him

144
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:46,402
That <i>he</i> had written them.

145
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,550
He was an expert at it...

146
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,251
He could copy anyone's handwriting.

147
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:02,401
He'd used my letters to write new ones to serve his purpose.

148
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:10,401
The blame was all mine as your Dad just saw the handwriting

149
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:14,511
And sent me

150
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:16,861
Divorce papers...

151
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,439
Do you know why he was with me

152
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:28,470
On the day of the accident?

153
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,559
I had convinced him

154
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,000
After much begging

155
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:43,500
To tell your Dad the truth... And confess his sins...

156
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,228
To tell your Dad... That I was innocent...

157
00:15:49,238 --> 00:15:53,598
But when fate strikes,

158
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:56,618
It kills you off

159
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,318
Where you don't get an ounce of relief...

160
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,714
He had an accident

161
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,603
And died right there...

162
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,050
He died, Jiya...

163
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:23,048
But robbed my life of everything...

164
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:26,468
Who could be more unfortunate

165
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:31,988
Than a woman whose husband bears not her pall,

166
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:38,492
Nor sheds a tear at her grave...

167
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,318
I am that woman today.

168
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,378
May God protect you. Always.

169
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,709
When you see your Dad,

170
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,168
Ask him

171
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,568
If he could weep for me at my grave someday.

172
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:11,539
Perhaps his tears would be able to wash the blot on my name...

173
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,838
Come with me.

174
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,568
You're angry with me, aren't you?

175
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,389
Not at all.

176
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,689
I'm very happy.

177
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,398
You must be eager to slap me on my face.

178
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:38,098
Do you know why I've brought you to this secluded spot?

179
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,469
So you can slap me hard.

180
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,061
You can vent your anger,

181
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:53,880
Leaving my esteem untarnished.

182
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,318
I know I've hurt you.

183
00:19:02,678 --> 00:19:07,058
I also know that the curse of a broken heart is baneful.

184
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,991
But I'm not stopping you from cursing me...

185
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,838
All I'm saying, Gulrez, is... I'm innocent...

186
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:22,818
I've played life like a cricket match in my ignorance.

187
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:26,019
You're not bad at winning me a match,

188
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,229
But my heart said

189
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:31,301
That he should be the one to lead me to victory.

190
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,159
So,

191
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,908
You couldn't make the team.

192
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,178
Now,

193
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:46,218
Do you forgive me or will you slap me?

194
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:57,683
Why are you smiling?

195
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,499
Who apologises in love?

196
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,753
You never apologise

197
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,580
To one you've never loved.

198
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:07,781
And --

199
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:11,043
All your insult? What about that?

200
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:13,146
I'd written you a letter...

201
00:20:13,706 --> 00:20:16,156
'Never give me woe,'

202
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,849
'For I can endure it.'

203
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,678
I've hurt you so much --

204
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,727
So bad...

205
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,847
Please forgive me...

206
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,807
Again?

207
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:42,773
I feel I'd never be able to meet your gaze if I'm married to anyone else...

208
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,453
What do you mean, 'anyone else'?

209
00:20:46,603 --> 00:20:48,814
You're talking about Waqar.

210
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:52,894
Why not name him?

211
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,597
Actually, I haven't really decided...

212
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,980
I mean -- It could be him...

213
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,548
You glunterpeck! He's an all-rounder!

214
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:15,168
Your team won't do without him.

215
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,810
Let's go out to lunch.

216
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,210
Lunch?

217
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,874
I thought I'd give you a treat from the Gang's fund if you didn't slap me.

218
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,251
Come!

219
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,279
Here you go, my friends! Enjoy yourselves!

220
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,068
What's this? 'Enjoy ourselves' on these bleeding 200 Rupees? Keep them!

221
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,608
How much do you want?

222
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:01,278
500.

223
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,390
I've called you 'friends'. You folks should be ashamed of yourselves, demanding money like that!

224
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,201
Bugger off!

225
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,508
Where did you get this Foxy?

226
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,558
Gulrez gave it to me.

227
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,190
Gulrez gave you?

228
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,278
Where's Gulrez?

229
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,209
With Maheen.

230
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:29,613
What?

231
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,621
Not 'what,' ask 'why!'

232
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:35,101
Aye, why'd he go with her?

233
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:38,133
What are they up to this time?

234
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,961
He shouldn't even greet that blighter back after everything that happened last night!

235
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:44,954
He didn't greet her back,

236
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:47,314
Because she never greeted him.

237
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:51,723
She stopped the car, bossed around, and took him with her.

238
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:53,934
But where?

239
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:00,310
Somewhere she could apologise, and Gulrez would say with terror in his eyes, 'I forgive you!'

240
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,525
Oh.

241
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,536
So now she'll apologise to him.

242
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:09,038
And he'll forgive her!

243
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,559
Shouldn't he?
-No way!

244
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,238
Never!

245
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,889
Give us our 200.

246
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,210
'Bout time you wised up!

247
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,665
Here!

248
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,080
Naff off already!

249
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,941
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, like, ever?

250
00:23:56,082 --> 00:24:00,148
You broke the engagement last night, but you're seeing him today!

251
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,328
Care to tell me

252
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,218
What you're up to?

253
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,458
What d'you want this time?

254
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,540
I wanted to say sorry.

255
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,369
I don't remember you saying sorry to us.

256
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:13,329
I will...

257
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,176
But first, I had to apologise to his broken heart.

258
00:24:17,176 --> 00:24:19,150
Our hearts are broken too.

259
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,777
Mine... Ammi Begum's...

260
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:26,400
Dastoor and Mehrunnisa left this place in disgrace!

261
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:29,928
No one's heart is broken here.

262
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,148
They're just... Troubled by the fact they couldn't keep their word from years ago.

263
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:39,808
I'd decided last night

264
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:45,229
That I won't slaughter my heart with my silence for someone's promise...

265
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,410
Wait!

266
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,939
Come here.

267
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,279
Where's he?

268
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,499
Went home.

269
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:58,798
No way he's going home.

270
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:03,035
Ammi Begum would break his legs!

271
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:06,315
I'm talking about Gulrez.

272
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:09,125
And I'm asking about the blighter.

273
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,928
What do I know?

274
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:13,219
When'd that happen?

275
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:16,009
What d'you do with this phone? Scratch your head?

276
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:22,318
I'm sure you've talked... Found out everything... Got word he's safe wherever he is.

277
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,499
So, again, where is he?

278
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,259
No idea.

279
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:32,000
The blighter must've gone in hiding! But don't worry... There's no place Ammi Begum can't reach!

280
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:36,510
Not his fault, really. I bet he didn't have the foggiest I'd stop him.

281
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,910
I dare him to set foot here.

282
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:40,530
Don't worry, he won't.

283
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,126
Isn't he coming here with a proposal?
-Hey!

284
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:46,310
Why does everyone think there's something going on between us?

285
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,250
Good heavens, girl...

286
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:50,486
You broke your engagement,

287
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:53,025
Stopped him from leaving...

288
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:58,039
What else should we wait for before we think you're interested in him?

289
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,960
No idea.

290
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,622
But I'm really sure about it...

291
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:13,898
The weirdest thing - that's what Gulrez thought too...

292
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,038
Send her to ruddy Coventry!

293
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:43,548
Coventry?

294
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,568
Aye. She's not going anywhere. Not even to University.

295
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:52,647
Okay, but what's that gonna achieve?

296
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,857
Confiscate her phone,

297
00:26:54,898 --> 00:26:59,550
And if you have to, cut the landline cable!

298
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,000
She'll fight back against this tyranny with obstinacy.

299
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,269
Precautions, my dear, are not tyranny.

300
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,219
But that's what she'd think!

301
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,514
Who cares what she thinks?

302
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,140
If she starts arguing about it,

303
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,060
Tell her that for what she's done to our family,

304
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,889
Generations to come would never forgive her.

305
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:30,032
Are we clear?

306
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,638
Yes.

307
00:27:31,892 --> 00:27:33,993
Remember, Suraiyya...

308
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:38,375
If love like hers ever got to win,

309
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:44,363
Elders such as ourselves would be left getting the groceries like servants.

310
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,798
Evidently...

311
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:48,798
And yes...

312
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:49,918
Yes?

313
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:52,168
Lock her room?

314
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,658
Lock her room?

315
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,598
Like, for real?

316
00:27:55,598 --> 00:27:58,428
Don't let her out

317
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,758
Until she changes her mind

318
00:28:01,962 --> 00:28:04,380
And heart...

319
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,788
Where's the twit?

320
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,758
Waqar?

321
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,889
Don't even mention his name...

322
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,509
Just tell me

323
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,830
If he's in town or gone for good.

324
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,069
No one knows

325
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:41,038
If he's in hiding or gone.

326
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,748
I told you

327
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:46,540
He's not going back.

328
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:50,319
You don't know the force that's stopping him.

329
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,980
She's just a puny little girl, that sissy.

330
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,131
Remember the last time she keeled over while bowling?

331
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,749
Someone get some sense into him.

332
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:09,733
Tell him what I'm talking about.

333
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:14,419
She's talking about the force of love.

334
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,249
No way.

335
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:20,329
She never said they love each other.

336
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,493
If you talk about love, don't you dare talk about anyone but Gulrez!

337
00:30:26,581 --> 00:30:28,898
He loves her...

338
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,198
Because why not?

339
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:37,181
She's his fiancée... Always has been!

340
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,418
Anyway...

341
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:45,489
I'll sort it out myself...

342
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:50,068
Just... Find out about the blighter...

343
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:54,708
And make it clear to him

344
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:55,708
That

345
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:58,928
It's best for his health

346
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,388
That he leave this place!

347
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:05,019
London?

348
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,099
He can go to hell, for all I care!

349
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,259
By that logic, Maheen ought to go straight to hell too...

350
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,478
<i>She</i>'s more guilty.

351
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,228
I mean --

352
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:20,736
She'd got engaged!

353
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,987
She ought to have thought about it!

354
00:31:24,037 --> 00:31:26,837
She's under his spell!

355
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,078
The blighter knows every wicked English trick in the book... He knows how to get the girls under his spell!

356
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,148
It'd be good if we found out by the evening.

357
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,808
Or, I've decided...

358
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,719
I'll get

359
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,618
A declaration of disownment published in the newspapers tomorrow.

360
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,641
That's why I never wanted to send him to London...

361
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,218
My heart said if he stayed there,

362
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,824
He'd learn the wicked ways of the blimmin' East India Company.

363
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,108
Could you read her feelings?

364
00:32:28,077 --> 00:32:29,528
Feelings?

365
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,931
Dado's missing him.

366
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,442
Hmm...

367
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,668
She can do anything when she's furious, Jiya.

368
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:51,158
She'd slit our throats to keep her word.

369
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,728
Disappear. Right now.

370
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,928
No.

371
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,588
I can't.

372
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,038
She'd be left all alone.

373
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:01,868
She's not afraid of her.

374
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:04,018
She is, mate...

375
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,288
But I know she's very brave.

376
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,458
Very daring.

377
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,858
Strange, Waqar...

378
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,798
If she were <i>that</i> serious about you...

379
00:33:16,878 --> 00:33:20,158
Why'd she have to put up this act with the engagement and all?

380
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,948
She could've said all of this way back...

381
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:25,809
Poor Gulrez...

382
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:29,844
Imagine what he'd be going through.

383
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,470
He must be on the rack.

384
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,759
It's so insulting.

385
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,098
I know, mate.

386
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,268
But...
-But?

387
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:44,782
As in, you've got an answer ready!

388
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,997
I thought people feared breaking hearts...

389
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:52,687
Never knew you'd be so ready to justify it!

390
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,106
That's the problem with all the winners.

391
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:59,487
Triumph blinds them

392
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:03,747
To everything those who lose have to go through.

393
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,290
I care about Gulrez too.

394
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,378
It hurts me to think

395
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,938
That our union would break him.

396
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:12,756
Did you meet?

397
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:14,077
Who?

398
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:16,108
Gulrez, of course.

399
00:34:16,362 --> 00:34:17,798
No.

400
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,838
Just see him.

401
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,569
Check out what losers in love look like.

402
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,288
I'll see him.

403
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,110
Say sorry too.

404
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,050
And?

405
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,328
You'd snatch his Maheen for just a puny little sorry and slip away sharpish?

406
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,668
Here's a tip -

407
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,953
<i>Never</i> see him again.

408
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:45,186
You're confusing me, Jiya.

409
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:50,437
You seem to forget that Maheen and I have the right to love as much as Gulrez.

410
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,678
You're mocking me for breaking a heart.

411
00:34:53,678 --> 00:34:55,408
What if I broke two?

412
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:56,949
Two?

413
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,380
Yours and hers?

414
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,488
Wow...

415
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:06,078
Ever care to check

416
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:09,158
If she's actually in love or just taking you for a ride?

417
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:11,129
C'mon, Jiya, we're friends.

418
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:14,138
That's why I'm saying it.

419
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:16,673
I know her better than you.

420
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:19,294
She doesn't speak the truth.

421
00:35:19,294 --> 00:35:22,685
But aye, I wouldn't say the same about her diary...

422
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,448
Scared?

423
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,378
Don't be.

424
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,480
She broke her engagement for you.

425
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,278
Called you to stop you.

426
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,938
Says a lot about who she'd write about.

427
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,068
But still...

428
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,128
Before you meet your love for the first time...

429
00:35:47,128 --> 00:35:50,148
Please, go see Gulrez.

430
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,888
Just once? To ease him, you know.

431
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:56,058
Okay, I will.

432
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,419
Although it hurts me...

433
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,938
I'm ashamed, really...

434
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:07,188
No idea what I'm gonna say to him...

435
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,838
But I'll see him.

436
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,980
I've got to.

437
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
