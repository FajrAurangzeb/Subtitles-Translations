1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance...</i>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This duty of showering flowers and saying prayers ends today.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not coming after today, Gulrez.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The treasure you'd held in your possession for four years

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which you'd been safeguarding for four years,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your debts

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are thus cleared

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As is my gloom.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to be brave.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take me along, Wali.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd have to come, Neelam.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm not one who'd listen

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Neelam is not generous with happiness.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How you'd said

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He's my brother too'?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he is not, why had you said it?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the car out.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's donned the same gown,

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same song is playing,

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same beautician has been called

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To deck her up.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't hesitate in speaking it now, Fajr.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lack the strength to stand against English!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you quiet today?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think today?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you feel today it's a love marriage?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked me to close your eyes again,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I closed my eyes and opened them.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told me a joke again,

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I said,

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'What was that'?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got delighted when you finished with the make-up quickly again.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm laughing every so often again.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you haven't asked again,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Is yours a love marriage'?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The second time, it's just a marriage.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a love marriage.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't add much to my sorrow,

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But had you been here, it'd have felt as if

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've not lost eight years.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know what it's like here?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's quiet...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if struck by a thunderbolt,

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if struck by a thunderbolt, as if afraid

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the groom may run away again.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, mate.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be done with it already.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're calling.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remembered something.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really afraid, mate.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not afraid, you're just embarrassed.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, buddy!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who brought this Foxy?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dado said that the procession must be led by this Foxy.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we go!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You started then and are arriving today.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit, you ate up eight years of my life.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring the bride.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and sit by the Reverend.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go forth with the marriage now that you've arrived.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else will you have for memories?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the evil gaze not touch you.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And left a letter addressed to you.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One has to yield.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Begin the nuptials, Reverend.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall I start, my child?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With five million rupees' worth of dowry

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is, in the presence of these witnesses

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hereby sealed.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With five million rupees' worth of dowry is, in the presence of these witnesses

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hereby sealed.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you accept this marriage?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why I'm thanking you?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen such a beautiful bride.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You did it for me.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And also because

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't let me remain a loser.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I needed seven runs to win on the last ball.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He played a no ball,

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you hit a six on that.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've won, Maheen.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the winner.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, Maheen...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost so many times in life

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I know how those who lose feel.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Winners never think

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of what those who lost go through.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's lost.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But nobody knows

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he used to win.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why did he, so suddenly, lose today?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that does not mean

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's perfidious.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His love for you is no less

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Than your disrelish for him.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'll come one day.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll wait for him.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, too, shall you.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'll wait for him.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That you'll wait for him.
Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sleep outside.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're exacting your ultion.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you, no.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just safeguarding.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've kept you with me as a treasure.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll keep you safe.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Good night.
Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You quaff the blood out of me</i>

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, my boy.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your trials end here.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Best of luck.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are the lights turned off?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want to see me as the groom?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, if that's what you want.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close your eyes.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to see you.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm turning on the lights.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!
-Stop right there, Waqar Ahmed!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop right there, Waqar Ahmed!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right there -- Standing before me --

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like --

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like -- a criminal in the witness box...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suits you well.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano says,

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Waqar Ahmed'

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Looks like a groom'

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Looks like a groom even in casuals'.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scared, eh?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd warned you, hadn't I,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll finish you off

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there's not the slightest relief for you.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Where there's not the slightest relief for you.
Quaff the blood out of me</i>

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ma --
Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ma -- Maheen!
Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dado!
Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dado!
And feast on my heart</i>

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dado!
And feast on my heart</i>

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Dastoor Uncle!
So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Maheen!
That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What happened?
That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Maheen!
That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and get a doctor!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen! Open your eyes!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What have you done, Maheen!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen! Open your eyes!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gone, Dado...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're --

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're just trying -- to no avail...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she says,

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'd finish you off',

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does so indeed.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when she says,

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll die --'

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She --

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She dies...

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As she left --

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She --

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Left me this letter.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I read it out, Dado?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read it out.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed,

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're scared, aren't you?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then...</i>

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surprised, aren't you?

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I sacrificed myself to surprise you.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me -

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you read the diary this time?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd even asked you to.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You felt embarrassed.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You felt ashamed.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me -

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you ran away from the marriage

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you not feel any step of the way that you were doing something wrong?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you feel ashamed any step of the way?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just saw my handwriting,

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But failed to see your name etched in my eyes,

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Failed to see

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Failed to see that detestation had given way to love,

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remained blind, also,

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To how I'd surrendered before you.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave, Waqar...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I beg you.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You went, trampling the girl

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd already accepted her defeat underfoot.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned out to be

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned out to be your usual Londoner tramp.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fell in love

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without knowing how to be in love.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that I'm dead, don't think

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I've exacted my vengeance.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've just shown you

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you should have faith

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the one you love;

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Else, in ceremonies of espousal, every boy gets a girl.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who needs to love?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know,

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have one thing to thank you for.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Gulrez died four years ago,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to think

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why I still dragged on.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he was right.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You came back at last.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coming to know of it,

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was enlivened again.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For before my exit, I had to be vivified for once.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For before my exit, I had to be vivified for once.
Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seeing your smile on the day of the wedding

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Took me back eight years to my happiness

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On hearing about my marriage.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the same happiness, back then,

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the same happiness, back then, you were separated from me,

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And in this happiness, I am from you.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Interesting coincidence, isn't it?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd felt then that I don't deserve you,

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt now

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt now that you don't deserve me.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The truth, Waqar Ahmed,

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that those who plead for love with rue

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do not deserve it.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its maker, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should, after I'm gone, the woe of separation excruciate you,

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell people miserably,

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That this eternal affliction of yours

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is a trifle before mine in that one moment

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That had struck me when I got the news that you'd left.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From what you did to me

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I leave you absolved,

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I wonder as I depart

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who will give you shrift for your sin

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of which

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For eight long years

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had grown to despise love?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I tell you, Waqar Ahmed,

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When it comes to ego, Maheen Aurangzeb can be far more ruthless than you.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll finish you off

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there'll not be the slightest relief.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance?</i>

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>
