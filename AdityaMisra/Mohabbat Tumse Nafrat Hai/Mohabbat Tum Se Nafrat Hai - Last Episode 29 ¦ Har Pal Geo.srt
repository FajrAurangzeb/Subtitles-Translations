1
00:01:51,530 --> 00:02:04,620
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance...</i>

2
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,570
This duty of showering flowers and saying prayers ends today.

3
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,060
I'm not coming after today, Gulrez.

4
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,760
The treasure you'd held in your possession for four years

5
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,750
Which you'd been safeguarding for four years,

6
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

7
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Your debts

8
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,310
Are thus cleared

9
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,928
As is my gloom.

10
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,140
Neelam

11
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,200
Please

12
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,770
You have to be brave.

13
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,180
Sit down.

14
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,976
Sit.

15
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,870
Don't take me along, Wali.

16
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,430
It kills me.

17
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,470
You'd have to come, Neelam.

18
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,370
And I'm not one who'd listen

19
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,767
That Neelam is not generous with happiness.

20
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,610
Remember

21
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,580
How you'd said

22
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,950
'He's my brother too'?

23
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,406
If he is not, why had you said it?

24
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,977
Get the car out.

25
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,660
She's donned the same gown,

26
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,420
The same song is playing,

27
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,680
The same beautician has been called

28
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,410
To deck her up.

29
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,560
Ahh!

30
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,160
I don't hesitate in speaking it now, Fajr.

31
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,440
I lack the strength to stand against English!

32
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,750
Why are you quiet today?

33
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,070
What do you think today?

34
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,058
Don't you feel today it's a love marriage?

35
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,940
You asked me to close your eyes again,

36
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,980
And I closed my eyes and opened them.

37
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,760
You told me a joke again,

38
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,140
And I said,

39
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,979
'What was that'?

40
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:00,010
I got delighted when you finished with the make-up quickly again.

41
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,110
I'm laughing every so often again.

42
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,090
But you haven't asked again,

43
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,510
'Is yours a love marriage'?

44
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,280
The second time, it's just a marriage.

45
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,716
Not a love marriage.

46
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,290
It doesn't add much to my sorrow,

47
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,230
But had you been here, it'd have felt as if

48
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,000
I've not lost eight years.

49
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,500
Do you know what it's like here?

50
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,130
Everyone's quiet...

51
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
As if struck by a thunderbolt,

52
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,970
As if struck by a thunderbolt, as if afraid

53
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,926
That the groom may run away again.

54
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,670
Come on, mate.

55
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,210
Be done with it already.

56
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,796
They're calling.

57
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,066
Let's go.

58
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,871
What happened?

59
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,900
Just --

60
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,306
Remembered something.

61
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,750
Honestly?

62
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,686
Yes?

63
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,290
I'm really afraid, mate.

64
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,430
You're not afraid, you're just embarrassed.

65
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,176
Come on, buddy!

66
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,110
Who brought this Foxy?

67
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,520
I did.

68
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,950
Your Dado said that the procession must be led by this Foxy.

69
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,057
Get in.

70
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,146
Here we go!

71
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,480
You started then and are arriving today.

72
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,911
You twit, you ate up eight years of my life.

73
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,353
Neelam!

74
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,486
Bring the bride.

75
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,220
Go.

76
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,000
Go and sit by the priest.

77
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,810
What are you looking at?

78
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,260
Go forth with the marriage now that you've arrived.

79
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,982
What else will you have for memories?

80
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,660
She's here.

81
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:43,470
Come.

82
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,416
May the evil gaze not touch you.

83
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,460
He's left.

84
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,676
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

85
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:38,740
And left a letter addressed to you.

86
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

87
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,450
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

88
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,280
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

89
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,470
One has to yield.

90
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,351
Begin the nuptials, Reverend.

91
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:17,644
Shall I start, my child?

92
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,762
Please.

93
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,140
Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

94
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,470
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

95
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,380
With five million rupees' worth of dowry

96
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,300
Is, in the presence of these witnesses

97
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,140
Hereby sealed.

98
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,677
Do you accept this marriage?

99
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,690
I accept.

100
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,660
Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed

101
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,510
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

102
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,610
With five million rupees' worth of dowry is, in the presence of these witnesses

103
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,420
Hereby sealed.

104
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,927
Do you accept this marriage?

105
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,410
I accept.

106
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,066
Do you accept this marriage?

107
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,760
I accept.

108
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,266
Do you accept this marriage?

109
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,976
I accept.

110
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,906
Thank you.

111
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
Do you know

112
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,547
Why I'm thanking you?

113
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,050
I've never seen such a beautiful bride.

114
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,616
You did it for me.

115
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,110
And also because

116
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,940
You didn't let me remain a loser.

117
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,940
I needed seven runs to win on the last ball.

118
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,020
He played a no ball,

119
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,896
And you hit a six on that.

120
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,510
I've won, Maheen.

121
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,896
I'm the winner.

122
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,437
But, Maheen...

123
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,530
I've lost so many times in life

124
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:10,760
That I know how those who lose feel.

125
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,990
You know what?

126
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,890
Winners never think

127
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,906
Of what those who lost go through.

128
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,910
He's lost.

129
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,610
But nobody knows

130
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,380
That he used to win.

131
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,579
But why did he, so suddenly, lose today?

132
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,226
He's left.

133
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,650
But that does not mean

134
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,140
That he's perfidious.

135
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,410
His love for you is no less

136
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,486
Than your disrelish for him.

137
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,850
My heart says

138
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,037
That he'll come one day.

139
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,020
And...

140
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,127
And I'll wait for him.

141
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,326
So, too, shall you.

142
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,430
Promise me

143
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,110
That you'll wait for him.

144
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,970
That you'll wait for him.
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

145
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:56,670
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

146
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,946
I'll sleep outside.

147
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,980
You're exacting your ultion.

148
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,771
I swear by you, no.

149
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,126
I'm just safeguarding.

150
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,830
I've kept you with me as a treasure.

151
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,476
I'll keep you safe.

152
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,210
Good night.

153
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,956
Good night.
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

154
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:40,340
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

155
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:51,459
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

156
00:23:52,530 --> 00:24:01,990
<i>You quaff the blood out of me</i>

157
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:11,520
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

158
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,206
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

159
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,930
Go, my boy.

160
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,596
Your trials end here.

161
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,256
Best of luck.

162
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:14,466
Why are the lights turned off?

163
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't you want to see me as the groom?

164
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,740
Alright, if that's what you want.

165
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,570
Close your eyes.

166
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,270
I want to see you.

167
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,981
I'm turning on the lights.

168
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,830
Maheen...

169
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,620
Maheen!

170
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,891
Maheen!
-Stop right there, Waqar Ahmed!

171
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:09,998
Stop right there, Waqar Ahmed!

172
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,046
Right there -- Standing before me --

173
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,320
Like --

174
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:33,036
Like -- a criminal in the witness box...

175
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,781
Suits you well.

176
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,340
Nano says,

177
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,500
'Waqar Ahmed'

178
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,320
'Looks like a groom'

179
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,594
'Looks like a groom even in casuals'.

180
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,156
Scared, eh?

181
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,576
Yes.

182
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,990
I'd warned you, hadn't I,

183
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,860
I'll finish you off

184
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,070
Where there's not the slightest relief for you.

185
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,270
Where there's not the slightest relief for you.
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

186
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,410
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

187
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,770
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

188
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,960
Ma --
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

189
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,800
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

190
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,530
Ma -- Maheen!
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

191
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,020
Dado!
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

192
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,260
Dado!
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

193
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,520
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

194
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,690
Dado!
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

195
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,420
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

196
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,670
Dastoor Uncle!
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

197
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:19,050
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

198
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:28,470
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

199
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,360
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

200
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,450
Maheen!
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

201
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,510
What happened?
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

202
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,480
Maheen!
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

203
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,300
Go and get a doctor!

204
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,540
Go!

205
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,680
Maheen! Open your eyes!

206
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,480
What have you done, Maheen!

207
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,416
Maheen! Open your eyes!

208
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,720
She's gone, Dado...

209
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,749
They're --

210
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,086
They're just trying -- to no avail...

211
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,280
When she says,

212
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,630
'I'd finish you off',

213
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,217
She does so indeed.

214
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,440
And when she says,

215
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,372
'I'll die --'

216
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,040
She --

217
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,510
She dies...

218
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:17,760
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

219
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:31,131
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

220
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,740
As she left --

221
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,088
She --

222
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,587
Left me this letter.

223
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,100
Should I read it out, Dado?

224
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,187
Yes...

225
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,974
Read it out.

226
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,730
Waqar Ahmed,

227
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,820
You're scared, aren't you?

228
00:32:52,050 --> 00:33:01,410
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

229
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:10,930
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

230
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:20,270
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

231
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:25,390
<i>I will remember you then...</i>

232
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,390
Surprised, aren't you?

233
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,480
I sacrificed myself to surprise you.

234
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,680
Tell me -

235
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,890
Why didn't you read the diary this time?

236
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,350
I'd even asked you to.

237
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,610
You felt embarrassed.

238
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,010
You felt ashamed.

239
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,030
Tell me -

240
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,070
When you ran away from the marriage

241
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,480
Did you not feel any step of the way that you were doing something wrong?

242
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,270
Didn't you feel ashamed any step of the way?

243
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,980
You just saw my handwriting,

244
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,130
But failed to see your name etched in my eyes,

245
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,930
Failed to see

246
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:18,100
Failed to see that detestation had given way to love,

247
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,370
Remained blind, also,

248
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:26,187
To how I'd surrendered before you.

249
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,720
Don't leave, Waqar...

250
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,006
I beg you.

251
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,160
You went, trampling the girl

252
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,660
Who'd already accepted her defeat underfoot.

253
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,900
Turned out to be

254
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,170
Turned out to be your usual Londoner tramp.

255
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,140
Fell in love

256
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,726
Without knowing how to be in love.

257
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,750
Now that I'm dead, don't think

258
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,770
That I've exacted my vengeance.

259
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,440
I've just shown you

260
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,770
That you should have faith

261
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,750
In the one you love;

262
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,160
Else, in ceremonies of espousal, every boy gets a girl.

263
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,710
Who needs to love?

264
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,300
Do you know,

265
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,880
I have one thing to thank you for.

266
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:47,400
When Gulrez died four years ago,

267
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,930
I used to think

268
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,690
Why I still dragged on.

269
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,480
But he was right.

270
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,060
You came back at last.

271
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,180
Coming to know of it,

272
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,181
I was enlivened again.

273
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,200
For before my exit, I had to be vivified for once.

274
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,546
For before my exit, I had to be vivified for once.
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

275
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:33,250
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

276
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:43,540
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

277
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:51,280
Seeing your smile on the day of the wedding

278
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,070
Took me back eight years to my happiness

279
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,050
On hearing about my marriage.

280
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,550
In the same happiness, back then,

281
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,290
In the same happiness, back then, you were separated from me,

282
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,460
And in this happiness, I am from you.

283
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,540
Interesting coincidence, isn't it?

284
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,650
You'd felt then that I don't deserve you,

285
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,360
I felt now

286
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,120
I felt now that you don't deserve me.

287
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,750
The truth, Waqar Ahmed,

288
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,120
Is that those who plead for love with rue

289
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,491
Do not deserve it.

290
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:48,700
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

291
00:37:48,700 --> 00:38:02,660
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

292
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:11,720
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

293
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:22,731
<i>The heart is its maker, and ends up being destroyed by it...</i>

294
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,280
Should, after I'm gone, the woe of separation excruciate you,

295
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,060
Tell people miserably,

296
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,740
That this eternal affliction of yours

297
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,420
Is a trifle before mine in that one moment

298
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,310
That had struck me when I got the news that you'd left.

299
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
From what you did to me

300
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,860
I leave you absolved,

301
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,110
But I wonder as I depart

302
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,370
Who will give you shrift for your sin

303
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,470
Because of which

304
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,190
For eight long years

305
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:11,371
I had grown to despise love?

306
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:17,050
Didn't I tell you, Waqar Ahmed,

307
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,770
When it comes to ego, Maheen Aurangzeb can be far more ruthless than you.

308
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,020
I'll finish you off

309
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:30,390
Where there'll not be the slightest relief.

310
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:58,190
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance?</i>

311
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:09,710
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

312
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:19,090
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

313
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:28,450
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

314
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:37,910
<i>Quaff the blood out of me</i>

315
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:47,350
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

316
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:52,090
<i>And feast on my heart</i>

317
00:40:52,090 --> 00:41:01,450
<i>So flightly is your playfulness that you desert in moments of jollification</i>

318
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:12,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>
