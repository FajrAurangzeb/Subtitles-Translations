2
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,728
This duty of showering flowers and saying prayers ends today.

3
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:24,938
I'm not coming back, Gulrez.

4
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:30,946
The treasure you'd held in your possession for four years

5
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,878
Which you'd been safeguarding for four years,

6
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

7
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,769
'Gulrez Akhtar, son of Akhtar Mahmoud'

8
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,308
Your debts

9
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,572
Are thus cleared

10
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,490
As is my gloom.

11
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,186
'Gulrez Akhtar, son of Akhtar Mahmoud'

12
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,891
Neelam,

13
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,821
Please...

14
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,421
You have to be brave.

15
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,951
Sit down.

16
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:50,482
Sit.

17
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,068
Don't take me along, Wali.

18
00:04:00,618 --> 00:04:03,038
It kills me.

19
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,569
You'd have to come, Neelam.

20
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,198
And I'm not one who'd hear

21
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,004
That Neelam is not generous with happiness.

22
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,299
Remember

23
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,351
How you'd said

24
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,891
'He's my brother too'?

25
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,660
If he is not, why'd you say it?

26
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,888
Get the car out.

27
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,058
She's donned the same gown,

28
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,498
The same song is playing,

29
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:28,398
The same beautician has been called

30
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,158
To deck her up.

31
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:33,298
Ahh!

32
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:36,492
I don't hesitate now, Fajr.

33
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:42,102
I lack the strength to stand against English!

34
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,979
Why are you so quiet today?

35
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,918
What do you think today?

36
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:34,048
Don't you feel it's a love marriage today?

37
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,330
You asked me to close my eyes again,

38
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,842
And I closed my eyes and opened them.

39
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,970
You told me a joke again,

40
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,391
And I said,

41
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,696
'What was that'?

42
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,279
I got delighted when you finished with the make-up quickly again.

43
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:03,149
I'm looking for excuses to laugh again.

44
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:06,680
But you haven't asked this time,

45
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,150
'Is yours a love marriage'?

46
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:11,930
The second time's just a marriage.

47
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,471
Not a love marriage.

48
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,088
It doesn't add much to my sorrow,

49
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:49,065
But had you been here, it would've felt as if

50
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:52,955
I haven't lost eight years.

51
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,111
Do you know what it's like here?

52
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,630
Everyone's quiet...

53
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,459
As if struck by a thunderbolt,

54
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,140
As if afraid

55
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,719
That the groom may run away again.

56
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,737
Come on, mate.

57
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,060
Be done with it already.

58
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,690
They're calling.

59
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,581
Let's go.

60
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,948
What happened?

61
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:20,738
Just --

62
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,418
Remembered something.

63
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,548
Honestly?

64
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:29,858
Yes?

65
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:33,419
I'm really afraid, mate.

66
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:37,128
You're not afraid, you're just embarrassed.

67
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,889
Come on, buddy!

68
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,918
Who brought this Foxy?

69
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,318
I did.

70
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,739
Your Dado said that the procession must be led by this Foxy.

71
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,299
Get in.

72
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,358
Here we go!

73
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,378
Took you long enough!

74
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,838
You twit, you ate up eight years of my life.

75
00:12:57,289 --> 00:12:58,757
Neelam!

76
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,970
Bring the bride.

77
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,448
Go.

78
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,989
Go and sit by the Reverend.

79
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,381
What are you looking at?

80
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:45,921
Go forth with the marriage now that you've arrived.

81
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:49,323
What else will you have for memories?

82
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,490
She's here.

83
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,959
Come.

84
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,928
May the evil gaze not touch you.

85
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,957
He's left.

86
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,898
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

87
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:37,699
And left a letter addressed to you.

88
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,318
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

89
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:47,118
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

90
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:51,039
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

91
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,419
One has to yield.

92
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,049
Begin the nuptials, Reverend.

93
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,100
Shall I start, my child?

94
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,752
Please.

95
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,899
Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb

96
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,250
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed,

97
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,119
With five million Rupees' worth of dowry

98
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,149
Is, in the presence of these witnesses,

99
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:47,950
Hereby sealed.

100
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,009
Do you accept this marriage?

101
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,552
I do.

102
00:17:14,275 --> 00:17:16,490
Waqar Ahmed, son of Mashood Ahmed,

103
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,299
Your sacred bond of matrimony with Maheen, daughter of Aurangzeb,

104
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,455
With five million Rupees' worth of dowry is, in the presence of these witnesses,

105
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,238
Hereby sealed.

106
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:28,022
Do you accept this marriage?

107
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,309
I do.

108
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:48,179
Do you accept this marriage?

109
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,379
I do.

110
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,580
Do you accept this marriage?

111
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,298
I do.

112
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,758
Thank you.

113
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,839
Do you know

114
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,570
Why I'm thanking you?

115
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,028
I've never seen such a beautiful bride.

116
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:09,078
You did it for me.

117
00:20:12,997 --> 00:20:15,738
And also because

118
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,932
You didn't let me remain a loser.

119
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:23,978
I needed seven runs to win on the last ball.

120
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,308
He played a no ball,

121
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,558
And you hit a six.

122
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:37,998
I've won, Maheen.

123
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:41,119
I'm the winner.

124
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,623
But, Maheen...

125
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,590
I've lost so many times in life

126
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:07,990
That I know how those who lose feel.

127
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,260
You know what?

128
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,328
Winners never think

129
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:20,988
Of what those who lose go through.

130
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,338
He's lost.

131
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:32,968
But nobody today knows

132
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,062
That he used to win.

133
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:43,308
But why did he, so suddenly, lose today?

134
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:49,889
He's left.

135
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,120
But that does not mean

136
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,686
That he's perfidious.

137
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,057
His love for you is no less

138
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:06,507
Than your disrelish for him right now.

139
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:15,929
My heart says

140
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,060
That he'll come back one day.

141
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,808
I'll...

142
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:28,539
I'll wait for that day...

143
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,569
And so, too, shall you.

144
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,889
Promise me

145
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,971
That you'll wait for him.

146
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:44,051
That you'll wait for him.

166
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,519
