1
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,889
Fajr!

2
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,341
Wait here!

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,642
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,943
No.

5
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,182
<i>I</i>'m sorry.

6
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,348
I didn't even ask you, Maheen...

7
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,938
Let's talk in the morning, shall we? I'm sleepy...

8
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:22,067
The night's going to be long.

9
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:26,468
Besides, everyone there knows your decision.

10
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,730
It isn't wrong to refuse...

11
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:34,652
But it should be done properly.

12
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,288
I haven't refused.

13
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,938
I just couldn't... Accept that bolt from the blue.

14
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,940
It almost felt like... A conspiracy... Not my betrothal.

15
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,611
You twit...

16
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,944
As if I'd conspire against you!

17
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm your mother!

18
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:01,871
Looking at you,

19
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,492
I get a feeling that sometimes,

20
00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:07,448
You end up conspiring even when you don't want to.

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,698
That's what happened with you...

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,698
I felt like it wasn't an engagement...

23
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:19,798
It was my punishment for stealing his Foxy!

24
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:24,319
I was so scared I shoved the ransom in his face!

25
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,179
Get to the point...

26
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,018
What now?

27
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:31,539
Everyone there thinks you've refused.

28
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,449
Tell them I haven't refused...

29
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,880
I need time to think.

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,769
How much?

31
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,238
No idea...

32
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:45,849
I may just accept it right away!

33
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:48,949
And I may spend the whole night thinking...

34
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,490
And what'd it mean if you spent the whole night thinking?

35
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,761
You accept it, don't you?

36
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,741
Why don't I have the right to refuse?

37
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,400
Would you rather refuse?

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,317
Blimey, Mum, let me think!

39
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,687
Also think...

40
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:10,348
Ammi Begum might have a heart attack if you refused.

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,848
There!

42
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,222
Did you hear that?

43
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,029
She's here.

44
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,608
Well, at least we know she hasn't had a heart attack!

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,389
Thank goodness.

46
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,560
You can tell her what you want.

47
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,152
I'll get going.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,888
Mum!

49
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,138
Not today.

50
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,555
Just tell her --

51
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:50,135
I turned in.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,130
I want to be sure when I talk to her.

53
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,988
We've sworn never to lie to each other. Gangmates, you know.

54
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,808
Where's Maheen?

55
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,859
Sleeping.

56
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,108
But how?

57
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:36,299
How could she just crucify us like that and go to sleep?

58
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:38,558
Please, sit...

59
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:45,058
Your daughter practically spat in Kaneez Begum's face before everyone,

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,357
And you're asking me to sit!

61
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,808
Don't even think about it!

62
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,108
Ruined the birthday,

63
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:06,328
And killed the joy of Waqar Ahmed's return!

64
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:11,899
Why'd you have to drop the engagement bombshell? Remember her stopping the car?

65
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,690
Stopping the car?

66
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,920
When you asked if she were married off to someone like him,

67
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,148
And she said that's how her life would come to a halt.

68
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,759
Ah, yes...

69
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:32,908
That's what happened.

70
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,028
All your Mum's fault.

71
00:05:38,718 --> 00:05:41,438
She says just about anything!

72
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:43,991
By the Lord, Ammi Begum!

73
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:47,110
You asked me to say --

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,688
Did I ask you to say it right then?

75
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:56,251
You, Suraiyya Ali, have learnt nothing from me.

76
00:05:58,137 --> 00:06:03,918
What kind of twit would get everything done before even talking to the girl?

77
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,448
So she's got no time to think, no time to decide, no time to refuse.

78
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,558
You do know it works only when she loves you too, don't you?

79
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,178
Do you still think

80
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:25,730
She'd refuse?

81
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,689
She won't!

82
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,589
She's asked for time. She's thinking.

83
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,984
Thinking...

84
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,525
So she's got another option...

85
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,219
What do you think?

86
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,208
She's hoping to get you?

87
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,798
Good girls have always got a few options.

88
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:46,079
She picks one and all the rest get the bad news.

89
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,655
In that case,

90
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,506
I'll hear the bad news.

91
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:52,197
No one's saying that!

92
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:58,340
Running 10 kilometres tormented like this here won't get you anywhere!

93
00:06:58,402 --> 00:06:59,382
Okay...

94
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:04,112
So she's got the right to refuse, but I haven't got the right to be tormented?

95
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,838
Gulrez!

96
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:13,627
May I say something?
-You better not, Dastoor Ahmed!

97
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,468
He's a goner...

98
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:25,228
Who?

99
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:27,918
The poor Gulrez.

100
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,568
And finally, the Foxy will get to outlive him...

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,558
Don't worry.

102
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,350
She hasn't refused.

103
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,238
She's just asking for time.

104
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,578
I'll have a cuppa.

105
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,567
She's just asked for time to think.

106
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,808
I love my Foxy.

107
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:06,729
Love can be an augurer, a parrot...

108
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,149
I know when she's gonna work

109
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:13,429
And when she's gonna stop on the road.

110
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,160
And

111
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,450
I don't take her for a ride when she's not in the mood.

112
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,480
Balderdash!

113
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,981
You're underestimating love.
-I'm underestimating your bleedin' augurer!

114
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:29,591
Love is very different for boys and girls.

115
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,661
Boys augur, girls think.

116
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,991
Just let her.

117
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,747
Why are you standing?

118
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:54,247
Sit down.

119
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,918
She's asking for time to think.

120
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,668
What do you think she'll say?

121
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,291
I mean... Why are you so positive?

122
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,957
If she's asked for time...

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,068
My experience says she'll aceept...

124
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,848
What if she didn't?

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,228
Gordon Bennett...

126
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:34,108
Don't ruin my nice little cuppa, Fajr...

127
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,708
Where's Waqar Ahmed?

128
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,419
It's 2, Suraiyya.

129
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:49,224
He ain't off his trolley like you to be up all night.

130
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,948
Been there since 10.

131
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:59,679
Used to drop by every now an then... But it's been 4 years now.

132
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,519
What about me?

133
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,109
Nice to meet you.

134
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,120
But I'm surprised we became friends so quickly...

135
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,058
I don't believe that a boy and a girl can be friends...

136
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:12,339
I do.

137
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,668
No jealousy between them.

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,078
Because no friendship between them!

139
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,910
Mostly, the lads are just waiting for their moment...

140
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,709
When friendship gives way to love...

141
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,568
Very desi [Asian]. Very un-English.

142
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,038
Anyway, tell me about yourself.

143
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:35,683
Nothing much...

144
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,178
I was about 8

145
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:41,519
When Dad divorced Mum

146
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,068
For another woman...

147
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,438
Oh...

148
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:46,939
But...

149
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,908
Mum loved Dad far more than me.

150
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,429
She couldn't live without him.

151
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,321
Died within two years.

152
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,568
I've been with Dad since...

153
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,918
But I don't like him.

154
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,348
I went to London

155
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:13,639
For my catering and dining diploma.

156
00:11:13,698 --> 00:11:15,799
Aye, you told me on the plane.

157
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:17,610
What about your Mum and Dad?

158
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,629
Not with us.

159
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:23,230
Mum, Dad, Uncle and Aunt died in a plane crash 12 years ago.

160
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,210
That sounds familiar.

161
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,608
Hmm...

162
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:30,168
Dad was the Deputy Mayor.

163
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,098
Oh my God!

164
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:35,658
How's Maheen related to you?

165
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,438
Maheen?

166
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,318
You know her?

167
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,099
Duh, she's my best friend!

168
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,488
Wow! What a surprise!

169
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,688
So, how are you related?

170
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,920
She's my cousin... My Aunt's daughter!

171
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,821
Wow!

172
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,338
C'mon.

173
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,468
Yeah, move it aside!

174
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,097
Double time!

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,500
Now push!

176
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,449
C'mon!

177
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,918
Double time!

178
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,917
Ain't got no time to loll about!

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,029
Harder!

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,888
Go!

181
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,858
You're not the Chief anymore.

182
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:04,200
What d'you mean?
-You lost us 25 gee last night!

183
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,709
We're back to bein' boracic!

184
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,660
You outta your mind? He almost ravished your Chief!

185
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,930
Look... You're ruining the gang for your own gain.

186
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,908
How selfish!

187
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:21,260
You seriously want me to marry that Scrooge to save your 25 gee?

188
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,888
No way!

189
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,298
I always see you with him.

190
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,088
You related to him or the car?

191
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,028
How 'bout both?

192
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,778
Gotta say, sir, you're brave.

193
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:14,068
You don't know him, mate...

194
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,749
Aye. Absolutely.

195
00:14:16,787 --> 00:14:22,178
He cares for his Foxy better than most people care for their sisters!

196
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,668
Lover is more like it.

197
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,318
Ooh, first love.

198
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,727
I didn't get the 'ooh' part.

199
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,659
Out of sympathy.

200
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,289
What it is is his first love

201
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,519
Ain't gonna be with us for long.

202
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,279
If he heard the bill,

203
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,790
He'd wish her with death, for real!

204
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,049
He'd never say that.

205
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,150
He's a bit touchy about his Foxy.

206
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,662
She's his one true love.

207
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:50,880
Wow...

208
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,741
Why don't you ask the personal question you're getting so close to?

209
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,521
Is he

210
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,430
Alright upstairs?

211
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,070
What d'you mean?

212
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,838
You mind?

213
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:10,418
No...

214
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,688
I mean...

215
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,187
Does he

216
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,947
Come back home alright?

217
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:17,258
Of course.

218
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,338
He doesn't go out alone.

219
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,139
I get it.

220
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,858
I get it, mate...

221
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,591
What?

222
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:26,222
That

223
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:29,660
You keep a stickie in his pocket.

224
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes?

225
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,700
A stickie?

226
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,624
With?

227
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,391
Duh!

228
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:37,623
His name,

229
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:38,653
His Dad's name,

230
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:40,771
And his address, of course.

231
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:43,010
Lemme try -- Wanna have a cuppa?

232
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,207
Get the man a nice cuppa, will you, Ghaffar? And one for me too!
-Okay.

233
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,520
Sell your Foxy.

234
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,378
Sell Foxy?

235
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,768
I didn't ask anything about Foxy.

236
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,348
No way...

237
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:34,548
What?

238
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,310
You and the Foxy

239
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,810
Can't go on together...

240
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,030
The Foxy will be the end of you.

241
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,240
What's your problem with her?

242
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,560
She's your problem.

243
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,609
Trust her

244
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,460
And you'll be led astray.

245
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,111
You're weird, man...

246
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,806
I'm asking you about my fate,

247
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,740
And you're riding my Foxy.

248
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,131
Look...

249
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,930
I just told you what I can see...

250
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,701
It'd be better

251
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,708
If you don't ask anyone else.

252
00:17:07,806 --> 00:17:08,948
Why not?

253
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,816
Because it's clear

254
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,598
That unless you get rid of that Foxy,

255
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,018
You can't get rid of your ill fate.

256
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,319
Mind if I ask you something?

257
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,789
No?

258
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,478
What is it you refused to get rid of

259
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:27,918
Because of which you couldn't get rid of <i>your</i> ill fate?

260
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,738
Hey!

261
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,688
I had a Foxy too...

262
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:40,769
Just like yours...

263
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:41,948
Shut up!

264
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:44,458
I ain't giving you a penny!

265
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:47,309
I knew it

266
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,959
When you came here...

267
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,119
How?

268
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,179
I read

269
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:58,110
My fate on your hands first.

270
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,389
I could see that those hands

271
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,658
Won't give a penny.

272
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,437
So, sir...

273
00:18:41,357 --> 00:18:42,728
How's she?

274
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,331
Tryin' me best, but...

275
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,331
It's gonna cost some...

276
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,961
70 gee?

277
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,886
70 gee?

278
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,371
You outta your mind?

279
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,851
I could sell her for 40.

280
00:18:58,001 --> 00:19:02,991
Aye, but when've late life medical bills been cheap?

281
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,462
Late life?

282
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,372
Medical bills?

283
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,778
Watch what you're saying!

284
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,878
Watch what <i>you</i>'re sayin'!

285
00:19:10,878 --> 00:19:12,728
I say,

286
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:13,929
Take your 40.

287
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,410
Don't spend 70!

288
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,529
And...

289
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:20,370
You can think of her as your lover all you want,

290
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,138
But she can't go on!

291
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,892
'Bout time you found someone else!

292
00:19:25,058 --> 00:19:29,048
In fact, if you can afford it,

293
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:34,320
Sell her, add some o' your savings, and get a motorcycle. So much the better!

294
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,060
How dare you --
-Hey!
-What d'you think you're doing?

295
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,819
You heard what he said!

296
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,731
He's right.

297
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:49,390
Actually, you can't even get a bike with that money. Get a bicycle. Or better yet, a tricycle!

298
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,047
So you actually slapped her?

299
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,268
Four years ago! Can't believe she's still furious!

300
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,873
Governments change twice in four years here.

301
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:13,413
But...

302
00:20:13,883 --> 00:20:17,883
There's an ocean of difference between governments and hearts, laddie...

303
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,403
Honestly?

304
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,024
She's mad.

305
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,599
Get her treated!

306
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:31,171
Not like you're any better...

307
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,891
Who's gonna treat you?

308
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:36,792
Know what,

309
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:40,332
If I didn't slap her that day,

310
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:42,741
The four of us would've been arrested!

311
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,522
Know what she was up to?

312
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,933
Forget it, mate...

313
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,822
What?

314
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,510
None of your concern.

315
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,118
She's just a girl...

316
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:58,988
I'm sure she was up to her tricks, as always...

317
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,913
Tricks! That's like a massive understatement... And -- Aunt...

318
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,274
Hmm!

319
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,398
Can't you mind your tongue?

320
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,133
Go...

321
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:13,629
Say sorry to her.

322
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,750
Say what?

323
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,528
Say sorry...

324
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,238
It's best for you.

325
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,499
Or you won't find life easy in Karachi.

326
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,798
You threatening me?

327
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,680
No, m'lad...

328
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,091
I just want to say...

329
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,740
Bowing down for a moment ain't gonna hurt you...

330
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,609
But it'll sure calm her down...

331
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,620
Say sorry? To that imp?

332
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,830
If I bow down, she won't let me get back up, like ever!

333
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,168
As if she'd let you if you don't!

334
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,038
You're going too far up and away, boy... It's a long way down.

335
00:21:55,098 --> 00:21:57,468
Dado's right.

336
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,258
Can it...

337
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,948
I'm never saying sorry.

338
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,498
I'm never bowing down before her.

339
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:09,068
Okay...

340
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:12,248
Have it your way...

341
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:15,088
Do something that says it for you.

342
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,490
Such as?

343
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,978
Blimey...

344
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:21,338
Do I really have to tell you?

345
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,890
Don't you live in London?

346
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,781
Don't you gad about, don't you see the ladies?

347
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:30,936
Learnt anything from all of that?

348
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,218
Ali... Tell him, will you?

349
00:22:36,218 --> 00:22:37,848
No need...

350
00:22:37,876 --> 00:22:39,530
You said it.

351
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,838
I'll say it...

352
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:43,999
'It was just a slap! Big deal'!

353
00:22:45,218 --> 00:22:47,829
So... Where's her room?

354
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Goodness knows who she thinks she is!

355
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,231
Poor lad...

356
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,928
Not so fast!

357
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:26,968
If you knock, she's gonna ask who it is.

358
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,280
I'll say, 'It's me'.

359
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,903
She ain't opening the door if it's you!

360
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,338
So?

361
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:36,579
I'll say 'It's me'.

362
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,498
I guess I'd better apologise.

363
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,839
And lose every ounce of respect here.

364
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,870
As if I'd be any better if I knocked!

365
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,464
Anyway --

366
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,331
<i>You</i>!

367
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,040
Right outside my room?

368
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:05,851
How.

369
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:06,110
How. Dare.

370
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,670
How. Dare. You!?

371
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:10,105
Don't speak English. Dado's downstairs.

372
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,055
Why are you here?

373
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:14,396
Thought I'd make peace.

374
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,109
Wow!

375
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,170
Dado wants me to forget everything. I thought that to forget everything, I should remember my fault.

376
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,040
You!

377
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,680
You! Get.

378
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,548
You! Get. Lost!

379
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:26,918
Forget making peace... Or forgiveness!

380
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:27,878
Aye,

381
00:24:27,878 --> 00:24:29,348
There's one way...

382
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,888
To make peace and forgive you...

383
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:33,825
We're all ears...

384
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,859
How 'bout I

385
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:37,838
Give him

386
00:24:37,838 --> 00:24:40,310
A proper slap? Just like his!
-Hey!

387
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,470
She's given you her word.

388
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,478
Blimey, Maheen, that slap was real bad...

389
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:47,068
I was right about you.

390
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,410
Absolutely right.

391
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,440
What?

392
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,818
You've got a screw loose! You're barking mad! Occasionally sane, and frequently insane!

393
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,850
You actually said that?

394
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,708
Oh, I wanted to say a lot more, but Dado ordered me to make peace, so I came here.

395
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:00,269
Im-

396
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:01,960
Im-POSSIBLE!

397
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,958
Back to work, everyone...

398
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,477
C'mon.

399
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,340
C'mon, folks... Guess we're just wastin' time here.

400
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,618
Peace be upon you.

401
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,208
And upon you, peace.

402
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,571
Where were you all day?

403
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,818
With Foxy.

404
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,477
Wonder who that is.

405
00:25:38,568 --> 00:25:40,450
Gulrez's car.

406
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,738
But you've got your own car.

407
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,660
Aye, but

408
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:48,460
I had to tow his Foxy

409
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,340
To the workshop.

410
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,990
Jesus Christ...

411
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,529
When will he see sense?

412
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,030
I guess there's only one way.

413
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:00,641
Yeah?

414
00:26:01,241 --> 00:26:04,648
Ask Maheen she'd better not

415
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,203
Accept the proposal

416
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,111
While the Foxy lives.

417
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:10,315
What d'you mean, lives?

418
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,259
He's betting 70 gee on that geriatric rust bucket.

419
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:17,521
He'd do anything to keep her alive.

420
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,699
Come here, mate...

421
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,158
Here.

422
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,127
Our profits have gone up 11% since last month.

423
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:31,498
Wow...

424
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,330
Congratulations.

425
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,426
We've hit all our targets

426
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:38,937
And production goals on time.

427
00:26:39,177 --> 00:26:41,418
And you know who did it.

428
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:42,740
Not me and you.

429
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,329
It's Gulrez.

430
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,958
Wow...

431
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,377
Hmm!

432
00:26:49,197 --> 00:26:50,828
So...

433
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:53,098
What d'you think?

434
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,847
D'you think... When she's done 'thinking'...

435
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,238
She'd agree?

436
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:58,500
Honestly?

437
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,659
No idea.

438
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,519
How'd I know?

439
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,666
I just know she wants some time to think.

440
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,925
Neelam says it's perfectly fine.

441
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,488
What d'you say?

442
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:15,348
No idea.

443
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:17,429
But aye, Ammi Begum said

444
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,322
It's nothing to worry about.

445
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,581
Then why are you so worried?

446
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:26,301
I'm sure she just wants to give Gulrez the frights.

447
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:30,061
Looking at Gulrez, you can't exactly fault her.

448
00:27:31,092 --> 00:27:33,353
I think she'd agree

449
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,933
After she's done playing with him.

450
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:38,033
Hmm...

451
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,823
May God will thus.

452
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,344
Tea?

453
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,899
Sure.

454
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,978
No.

455
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:49,998
No way we can make peace until Doomsday.

456
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:55,018
Who'd want to make peace with that ham-fisted, insolent, arrogant girl?

457
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,818
She hasn't got an ounce of decency in her!

458
00:27:57,879 --> 00:27:59,159
I mean --

459
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:01,969
Imagine you're back from England after four long years,

460
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:04,479
And go to your cousin's to see her,

461
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,481
Only to find out the lady left a birthday party because of shock over some engagement foul-up,

462
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:13,141
And be welcomed as a runagate when you finally see her!

463
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,207
Suddenly, she remembers an old slap,

464
00:28:16,207 --> 00:28:17,958
And, when you try to make peace,

465
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,798
Shuts the door in your face!

466
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,068
Tell me - would either of you ever want to see her face again?

467
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,812
No, yes?

468
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:35,668
Yes!

469
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,208
That's what I think too.

470
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,998
We didn't say a word.

471
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:41,010
That's what your silence said.

472
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,650
No. Our silence means you're plain wrong.

473
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,008
Yes!

474
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,258
You're all in it together.

475
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:51,859
Partly, you're right. We took an oath. Pledged our allegiance.

476
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,499
Ooh...

477
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,859
Now I know who's inflaming her.

478
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,290
She's just asking for her right.

479
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,651
Which you violated so unashamedly with that slap.

480
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:03,631
Ooh.

481
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:08,290
If you just said a simple sorry instead of that 'ooh', I'm sure she'd forgive you.

482
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,440
Wow...

483
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,207
The words we recommend to you are the simple...

484
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:12,638
'I

485
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:13,038
'I am

486
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:14,059
'I am sorry'!

487
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:14,648
Shut.

488
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:15,599
Shut. Up!

489
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,678
That adds fuel to the fire!

490
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:19,229
I don't care.

491
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:21,940
You have to, Waqar Ahmed. She's my sister.

492
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,671
And I'm an eyewitness.

493
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:26,900
I've seen her cry for hours over that slap.

494
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,014
But it's your choice...

495
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,200
C'mon!

496
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,618
Ju -- Just a sec! Hey!

497
00:29:31,618 --> 00:29:33,158
On your feet!

498
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,140
And I'm an eyewitness.

499
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,848
I've seen her cry for hours over that slap.

500
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,318
What does the doctor say?

501
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,827
I mean, the mechanic...

502
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,048
Don't even mention him.

503
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:22,850
I haven't seen such a cheap man!

504
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,741
Wali told me everything.

505
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,010
She can't be fixed!

506
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,468
I know.

507
00:30:29,518 --> 00:30:32,049
Then could you please leave this -- Funeral?

508
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:34,728
I was thinking about the palmist.

509
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:37,479
You saw a palmist?

510
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,989
Doesn't make much of a difference, that.

511
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,210
What?

512
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,130
That man was more of a mechanic.

513
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:47,035
I'm sure he told you it's her time.

514
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:50,600
He said my fate is inseparable from hers.

515
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,809
As in, he wants you to keep it with you?

516
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,438
No.

517
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:58,048
He wants me to sell her,

518
00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:03,919
Or, he says, my life would be at a dead end. Like her.

519
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,319
He's got a point, Neelam...

520
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,428
When she heard about the engagement, she was drained of all cheer.

521
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,072
Almost felt like... She'd refuse...

522
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,638
She said she needed some time to think...

523
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,808
I'm at a dead end, so to speak...

524
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,688
Who knows how long she needs...

525
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:34,068
And how long I need to decide whether to sell this Foxy

526
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:36,572
Or spend 70 gee on her...

527
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,278
If you ask me... Even if she won't move an inch now...

528
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:52,038
I can't forget how she's stood by me all these years.

529
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,208
I haven't had anything all day.

530
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,408
Looking at her dying old face kills my hunger.

531
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,618
Come in for lunch?

532
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,011
Blimey, Neelam... Don't you get it?

533
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,918
I'm asking you if I should spend 70 gee on her.

534
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,998
I don't see why not.

535
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,298
Aye, Wali...

536
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,269
What is it?

537
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,498
I'm very upset.

538
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,260
Aren't we all?

539
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,072
What happened?

540
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,748
It's simple.

541
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,228
It's so simple.

542
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:03,228
He'd die without Maheen.

543
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,110
I thought I'd remind you...

544
00:33:20,644 --> 00:33:24,575
Our family's borne too many palls already.

545
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,348
That was an accident.

546
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,261
But this time,

547
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:38,561
The death

548
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,781
Would be our doing.

549
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,867
Hello?

550
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,868
Hello!

551
00:34:29,357 --> 00:34:30,397
Who is it?

552
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:33,218
I thought you'd recognise my voice.

553
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,293
Your voice

554
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,314
Sounds familiar.

555
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,815
You sound like my dirty rotten cousin.

556
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:43,836
Who are you?

557
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:47,097
Your dirty rotten cousin.

558
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:48,316
Hey!

559
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:51,121
How dare you call me?

560
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:54,561
Heard you cried that day. After the slap...

561
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:55,785
So?

562
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,321
I feel guilty.

563
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:58,423
So?

564
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,162
Are you seriously 'so'-ing my sympathy?

565
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,059
Listen, Waqar Ahmed,

566
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:05,330
Don't you dare call me again. Like, ever.

567
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,399
You're not allowed. Get it?

568
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,409
Alright, but I've got one last thing to say to you...

569
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,799
Go on.

570
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,361
I hate you.

571
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:16,701
I HATE YOU TOOOOOO!!!

572
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
