1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait here, Fajr!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't even ask you, Maheen...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's talk in the morning, shall we? I'm sleepy...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The night's going to be long. Besides, everyone there knows your decision.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't wrong to refuse... But it should be done properly.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't refused.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just couldn't... Accept that bolt from the blue.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It almost felt like... A conspiracy... Not my betrothal.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit... As if I'd conspire against you!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your mother!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at you, I get a feeling that sometimes, you end up conspiring even when you don't want to.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happened with you...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt like it wasn't an engagement...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my punishment for stealing his Foxy!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so scared I shoved the ransom in his face!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get to the point... What now?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone there thinks you've refused.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them I haven't refused...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need time to think.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I may just accept it right away!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I may spend the whole night thinking...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what'd it mean if you spent the whole night thinking?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You accept it, don't you?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't I have the right to refuse?
-Would you rather refuse?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mum, let me think!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also think...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum might have a heart attack if you refused.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you hear that? She's here.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, at least we know she hasn't had a heart attack!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness. You can tell her what you want. I'll get going.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not today.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell her I'm sleeping.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to be sure when I talk to her.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've sworn never to lie to each other. Gangmates, you know.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Maheen?
-Sleeping.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she just crucify us like that and go to sleep?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your daughter practically spat in Kaneez Begum's face before everyone, and you're asking me to sit!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ruined my birthday, and killed the joy of Waqar's return!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you have to drop the engagement bombshell? Remember her stopping the car?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopping the car?

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you asked if she were married off to someone like him, and she said that's how her life would come to a halt.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happened.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All your Mum's fault.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says just about anything!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, Ammi Begum! You asked me to say --
-Did I ask you to say it right then?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've learnt nothing from me, Suraiyya.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of twit would get everything done before even talking to the girl?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got no time to think, no time to decide, no time to refuse.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do know it works only when she loves you too, don't you?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you still think she'd refuse?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's asked for time. She's thinking.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thinking...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got another option...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's hoping to get you? Good girls have always got a few options.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She picks one and all the rest get the bad news.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, I'll hear the bad news.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's saying that!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Running 10 kilometres tormented like this here won't get you anywhere!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got the right to refuse, but I haven't got the right to be tormented?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I say something?
-You better not, Dastoor Ahmed!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a gonner...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor Gulrez.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And finally, the Foxy will get to outlive him...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She hasn't refused.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just asking for time.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have a cuppa.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just asked for time to think.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love my Foxy.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love can be an augurer, a parrot...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know when she's gonna work and when she's gonna stop on the road.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't take her for a ride when she's not in the mood.
-Balderdash!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're underestimating love.
-I'm underestimating your augurer!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is very different for boys and girls.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boys augur, girls think.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let her.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you standing? Sit down.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's asking for time to think. What do you think she'll say?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Why are you so positive?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's asked for time...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My experience says she'll aceept...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if she did not?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gordon Bennett... Don't ruin my nice little cuppa, Fajr...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Waqar Ahmed?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 2, Suraiyya.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't crazy like you to be up all night.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Been there since 10.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Used to drop by every now an then... But it's been 4 years now.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about me?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice to meet you.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm surprised we became friends so quickly...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe that a boy and a girl can be friends...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No jealousy between them.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because no friendship between them!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
