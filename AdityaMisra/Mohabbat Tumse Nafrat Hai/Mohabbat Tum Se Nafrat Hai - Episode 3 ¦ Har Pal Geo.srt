1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait here!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't even ask you, Maheen...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's talk in the morning, shall we? I'm sleepy...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The night's going to be long.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides, everyone there knows your decision.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't wrong to refuse...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it should be done properly.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't refused.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just couldn't... Accept that bolt from the blue.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It almost felt like... A conspiracy... Not my betrothal.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'd conspire against you!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your mother!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at you,

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get a feeling that sometimes,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You end up conspiring even when you don't want to.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happened with you...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt like it wasn't an engagement...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was my punishment for stealing his Foxy!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so scared I shoved the ransom in his face!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get to the point...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What now?

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone there thinks you've refused.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell them I haven't refused...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need time to think.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I may just accept it right away!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I may spend the whole night thinking...

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what'd it mean if you spent the whole night thinking?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You accept it, don't you?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't I have the right to refuse?
-Would you rather refuse?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mum, let me think!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Also think...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum might have a heart attack if you refused.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you hear that?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, at least we know she hasn't had a heart attack!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can tell her what you want.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not today.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell her --

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I turned in.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to be sure when I talk to her.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've sworn never to lie to each other. Gangmates, you know.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Maheen?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sleeping.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how?

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could she just crucify us like that and go to sleep?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your daughter practically spat in Kaneez Begum's face before everyone,

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're asking me to sit!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ruined my birthday,

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And killed the joy of Waqar's return!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you have to drop the engagement bombshell? Remember her stopping the car?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopping the car?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you asked if she were married off to someone like him,

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she said that's how her life would come to a halt.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happened.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All your Mum's fault.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says just about anything!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, Ammi Begum!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked me to say --

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did I ask you to say it right then?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You, Suraiyya Ali, have learnt nothing from me.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of twit would get everything done before even talking to the girl?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got no time to think, no time to decide, no time to refuse.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do know it works only when she loves you too, don't you?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you still think

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd refuse?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's asked for time. She's thinking.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thinking...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got another option...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's hoping to get you?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good girls have always got a few options.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She picks one and all the rest get the bad news.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case,

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hear the bad news.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's saying that!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Running 10 kilometres tormented like this here won't get you anywhere!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she's got the right to refuse, but I haven't got the right to be tormented?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I say something?
-You better not, Dastoor Ahmed!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a goner...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor Gulrez.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And finally, the Foxy will get to outlive him...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She hasn't refused.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just asking for time.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have a cuppa.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just asked for time to think.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love my Foxy.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love can be an augurer, a parrot...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know when she's gonna work

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when she's gonna stop on the road.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't take her for a ride when she's not in the mood.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Balderdash!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're underestimating love.
-I'm underestimating your augurer!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is very different for boys and girls.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boys augur, girls think.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let her.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you standing?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's asking for time to think.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think she'll say?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Why are you so positive?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's asked for time...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My experience says she'll aceept...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if she did not?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gordon Bennett...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ruin my nice little cuppa, Fajr...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Waqar Ahmed?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 2, Suraiyya.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't crazy like you to be up all night.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Been there since 10.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Used to drop by every now an then... But it's been 4 years now.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about me?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nice to meet you.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm surprised we became friends so quickly...

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe that a boy and a girl can be friends...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No jealousy between them.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because no friendship between them!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mostly, the lads are just waiting for their moment...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When friendship gives way to love...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very desi [Asian]. Very un-English.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, tell me about yourself.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was about 8

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Dad divorced Mum

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For another woman...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum loved Dad far more than me.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She couldn't live without him.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Died within two years.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been with Dad since...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't like him.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to London

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my catering and dining diploma.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, you told me on the plane.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about your Mum and Dad?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not with us.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Dad, Uncle and Aunt died in a plane crash 12 years ago.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That sounds familiar.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad was the Deputy Mayor.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's Maheen related to you?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know her?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Duh, she's my best friend!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow! What a surprise!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, how are you related?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's my cousin... My Aunt's daughter!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, move it aside!

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Push it.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't got no time to loll about!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Harder!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not the Chief anymore.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?
-You lost us 25 gee last night!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're back to bein' boracic!

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You outta your mind? He almost ravished your Chief!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look... You're ruining the gang for your own gain.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How selfish!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seriously want me to marry that Scrooge to save your 25 gee?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

188
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,298
I always see you with him.

189
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,088
You related to him or the car?

190
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:06,028
How 'bout both?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, sir, you're brave.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know him, mate...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. Absolutely.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He cares for his Foxy better than most people care for their sisters!

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lover is more like it.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh, first love.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't get the 'ooh' part.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of sympathy.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is is his first love

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't gonna be with us for long.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he heard the bill,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd wish her with death, for real!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd never say that.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a bit touchy about his Foxy.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's his one true love.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you ask the personal question you're getting so close to?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright upstairs?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mind?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does he

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come back home alright?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't go out alone.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it, mate...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You keep a stickie in his pocket.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A stickie?

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Duh!

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His name,

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Dad's name,

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And his address, of course.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme try -- Wanna have a cuppa?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the man a nice cuppa, will you, Ghaffar? And one for me too!
-Okay.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sell your Foxy.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sell the Foxy?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't ask anything about the Foxy.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You and the Foxy

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't go on together...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Foxy will be the end of you.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem with her?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's your problem.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust her

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you'll be led astray.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're weird, man...

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm asking you about my fate,

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're riding my Foxy.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just told you what I can see...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be better

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't ask anyone else.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it's clear

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That unless you get rid of that Foxy,

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't get rid of your ill fate.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask you something?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it you refused to get rid of

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of which you couldn't get rid of <i>your</i> ill fate?</i>

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had a Foxy too...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like yours...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't giving you a penny!

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew it

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you came here...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I read

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My fate on your hands first.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could see that those hands

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't give a penny.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, sir...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's she?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tryin' me best, but...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's gonna cost some...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
70 gee?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
70 gee?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You outta your mind?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could sell her for 40.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but when've late life medical bills been cheap?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Late life?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Medical bills?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch what you're saying!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch what <i>you</i>'re sayin'!</i>

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say,

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take your 40.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't spend 70!

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can think of her as your lover all you want,

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she can't go on!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bout time you found someone else!

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, if you can afford it,

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sell her, add some o' your savings, and get a motorcycle. So much the better!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you --
-Hey!
-What d'you think you're doing?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard what he said!

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's right.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, you can't even get a bike with that money. Get a bicycle. Or better yet, a tricycle!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you actually slapped her?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Four years ago! Can't believe she's still furious!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Governments change twice in four years here.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's an ocean of difference between governments and hearts, laddie...

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's mad.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get her treated!

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not like you're any better...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's gonna treat you?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what,

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I didn't slap her that day,

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The four of us would've been arrested!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what she was up to?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, mate...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None of your concern.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just a girl...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she was up to her tricks, as always...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tricks! That's like a massive understatement... And -- Aunt...

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you mind your tongue?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say sorry to her.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say sorry...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's best for you.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or you won't find life easy in Karachi.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You threatening me?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, m'lad...

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want to say...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bowing down for a moment ain't gonna hurt you...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll also please her...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say sorry? To that imp?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I bow down, she won't let me get back up, like ever!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she'd let you if you don't!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're going too far up and away, boy... It's a long way down.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's right.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never saying sorry.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never bowing down before her.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do something that says it for you.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I really have to tell you?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you live in London?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you gad about, don't you see the ladies?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Learnt anything from all of that?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali... Tell him, will you?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said it.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say it...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'It was just a slap! Big deal'!

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Where's her room?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness knows who she thinks she is!

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor lad...

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd recognise my voice.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your voice

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sounds familiar.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sound like my dirty rotten cousin.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your dirty rotten cousin.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you call me?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard you cried that day. After the slap...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel guilty.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you seriously 'so'-ing my sympathy?

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, Waqar Ahmed,

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare call me again.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not allowed. Get it?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, but I've got one last thing to say to you...

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate you.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HATE YOU TOOOOOO!!!

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
