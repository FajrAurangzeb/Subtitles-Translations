1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,098
Umm...

2
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:14,892
Could you...

3
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:17,268
Return the photocopy?

4
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:18,798
Huh?

5
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:20,128
Photocopy?

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,938
Aye...

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,058
'He thinks I've fallen for him'...

8
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:43,678
'The poor prat'!

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,129
'If this be love, dear'...

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,680
'May you'

11
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:02,131
'Groan in agony'...

12
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,391
'"Amour"' (Love),

13
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,610
'"Je te déteste"' (I hate you)...

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,768
Here's your

15
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,688
Photocopy...

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,268
Feel free

17
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,378
To let me know

18
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,968
If you need anything.

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,178
Hello?

20
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:50,208
Give your Mum the phone.

21
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:51,692
Ammi Begum?

22
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,414
Nah, Aunt May.

23
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:58,888
Mum! It's Nano!

24
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,457
Here.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,228
Yes, Ammi Begum?

26
00:02:10,228 --> 00:02:13,367
Mehrunnisa scoffed at me.

27
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:14,758
Hey!

28
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,498
Did it hurt you?

29
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:18,609
I can't believe it!

30
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,299
I can...

31
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:25,013
When an otherwise-duteous daughter-in-law scoffs at you...

32
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:30,622
The mother-in-law should admit she's ruined everything.

33
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,382
What are you saying?

34
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,992
I didn't give in before her.

35
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:39,377
I blamed everything on the blighter!

36
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,898
But Suraiyya,

37
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:46,317
She's got a point.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,088
What?

39
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,828
I...

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,370
Broke too many hearts to keep my word...

41
00:02:56,328 --> 00:02:58,808
That actually you, Ammi Begum?

42
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,338
Nah,

43
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,010
It's your Aunt May!

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,929
Honestly?

45
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,859
I don't get it.

46
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,904
Last night...

47
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:16,140
I saw it myself.

48
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,579
I saw just how much they love each other.

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,228
They'd

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,518
Die if separated.

51
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,588
I'd been cruel to you once...

52
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:43,178
When I got you married to that wretched Aurangzeb...

53
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,988
You took it quietly...

54
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:53,299
But I wonder

55
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:58,548
If Maheen would take it lying down too.

56
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,350
But --

57
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:02,869
I --

58
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:10,101
How much longer can I make my family gulp down this poison? How much longer can I reign supreme?

59
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:18,478
I've got to be fair for a change... Concede my defeat before love sometime...

60
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,510
Got to admit that love - even between two twits -

61
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:27,949
Dwarfs our authority.

62
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,598
And Gulrez?

63
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:32,788
What about him?

64
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:35,350
What <i>about</i> him?

65
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,430
It happens when love is one-sided...

66
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:42,418
You get hunger, not food...

67
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,859
Anyway, bye...

68
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,159
Hang up already! I'm tearing up!

69
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,598
And --

70
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,208
I'm crying for the one

71
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,609
I'd slapped hard last night.

72
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,970
For real?

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,978
Can't you comfort me?

74
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:03,588
Say I'm not all that bad?

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,488
What are you saying?

76
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:11,420
It's hard to find a mother and friend like you in the world.

77
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,706
Thank you, Suraiyya.

78
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,361
Thank you very much.

79
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,175
You're speaking English?

80
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:23,521
It's okay if you really have to, sometimes!

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,688
Now --

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,110
Please hang up...

83
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,979
Before he slips away.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,351
Maheen...

85
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,703
Maheen!

86
00:06:02,408 --> 00:06:04,079
Maheen?

87
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,080
Where's Maheen?

88
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:19,030
Gone to see someone.

89
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,849
Who?

90
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,409
Gulrez.

91
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,660
Gulrez?

92
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:25,719
Why?

93
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,679
Waqar said he was just taking her for a ride last night.

94
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,601
And that he doesn't really love her at all.

95
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,840
So what's she gonna tell Gulrez?

96
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,110
Anything.

97
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:42,420
Perhaps even tell him everything and say... 'Good riddance'!

98
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,701
Good riddance?

99
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,811
Good riddance of someone who couldn't appreciate how much he's loved!

100
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:50,670
I say, don't stop her.

101
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,979
Let her have it her way.

102
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,348
She said as she left,

103
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:57,330
'Love's pointless'.

104
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,908
'Matches are made in Heaven'.

105
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,390
Stop her!

106
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,360
Call her! Ammi Begum's given in!

107
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,035
As if it makes any difference.

108
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,420
The man she turned the engagement down for refused.

109
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:14,850
She'd die but never marry him!

110
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,328
Good Lord...

111
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,158
Is he happy?

112
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:22,158
The twit was lying!

113
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,328
Someone must've told him to --

114
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:27,289
Nobody told <i>her</i> to do anything though.

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,938
Anyway...

116
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,437
Forget it.

117
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:35,178
Fix an auspicious date with Ammi Begum.

118
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,488
After the call last night,

119
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,193
Even I've accepted

120
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:43,435
Gulrez as my brother-in-law to-be!

121
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,698
Bless him, will you?

122
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,978
Why are you so quiet?

123
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,708
Have some?

124
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,880
Good news.

125
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,398
The tramp from London refused.

126
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,417
He ain't marrying me!

127
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,628
Oh?

128
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:28,281
This ain't good news for me.

129
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:29,562
Hey!

130
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,905
I'd call it bad news.

131
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,538
The separation of lovers

132
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,848
Makes the ground tremble.

133
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:42,098
Like an earthquake!

134
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,770
And - who knows - that's why the ground's gonna break on Doomsday.

135
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,728
Oh please. Nothing's gonna happen!

136
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:51,850
He doesn't even love me!

137
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,638
He swore before Nano, Uncle, Aunt, and Munshi Alam!

138
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:57,858
He was lying.

139
00:08:58,468 --> 00:09:00,860
Someone made him say it.

140
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,769
I'd like this 'someone' to try me!

141
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,909
You take a while to appreciate the solemn vows of love.

142
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:12,068
What was that?

143
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:13,858
Lovers

144
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:16,489
Are given to pitying.

145
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,109
He had pity on me.

146
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:22,788
Splendid!

147
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,718
Hear that, Neelam?

148
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,580
He's bewitched!

149
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,517
Absolutely.

150
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,413
Only a true sorcerer

151
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:35,810
Could sacrifice his love for his corrival and say he's leaving for London.

152
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,308
He's leaving for London?

153
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,498
If he didn't already.

154
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,419
In fact, it's essential

155
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,008
For his spell to work!

156
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,229
Well guess what, I've begun to loathe him!

157
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,903
I know that.

158
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,831
You blow hot and cold too often.

159
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,559
One cold lie...

160
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,229
And you got all hot-headed.

161
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:13,980
But tell me...

162
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,999
Even if he actually turned you down,

163
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:21,119
Could that ever change love into loathing?

164
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,259
You turned someone down too.

165
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,979
On the day of the engagement.

166
00:10:30,265 --> 00:10:32,966
You refused to wear the ring.

167
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,928
I don't loathe you one bit.

168
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,732
Why is it that your love

169
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,807
Grows to loathe your love so quickly?

170
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,128
If you ask me...

171
00:10:57,182 --> 00:11:00,398
If that's how you define love,

172
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,574
I'd loathe it too.

173
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:07,618
Let her finish.
-I won't.

174
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,079
I've been gravely wronged!

175
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,613
He had pity on me!

176
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:25,641
There can be no greater insult than pitying a lover.

177
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:30,731
I won't stay quiet.

178
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,620
I'll tell her everything.

179
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,590
What?

180
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,795
You called him over.

181
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,950
Showed him my letters to Maheen.

182
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,183
As in,

183
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:46,063
Gave him reason to have pity.

184
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,504
Swear by me if I'm lying.

185
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,334
C'mon?

186
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,026
I've burnt every single one of them.

187
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:59,948
Charred my treasure to ashes because he had pity on me.

188
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,906
That's how much it's hurt me.

189
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,666
Look...

190
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,371
How low I've fallen...

191
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,901
It's Neelam's fault.

192
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,979
She cried before him.

193
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:24,469
He had mercy on me.

194
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,070
So please, tell me...

195
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,880
If someone had mercy on lovers,

196
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,869
Which upright man out there would dare to fall in love?

197
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:41,550
We don't hear much about love of late,

198
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,909
So don't humiliate

199
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:46,960
The rare man who's fallen in love.

200
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,848
Hey...

201
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,793
Promise me...

202
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,008
Yeah?

203
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:21,248
My Foxy's leading your wedding procession.

204
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,209
I swear by you.

205
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,480
Your Foxy's gonna lead my wedding procession.

206
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,541
Your Foxy's gonna lead my wedding procession.

215
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,377
I feel so guilty, Jiya.

216
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,628
I love Maheen so much, but...

217
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,048
I don't want to marry her.

218
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,438
Why not?

219
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,769
Poor little Gulrez...

220
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,679
He loves her much more than I ever can.

221
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,478
So?

222
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,668
What?

223
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,728
I'm afraid

224
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,600
He may die

225
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,139
On the day of our wedding.

226
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:26,969
Talk about Maheen.

227
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,358
Who does she love?

228
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,979
She never said it, but...

229
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,009
I know there's something between us.

230
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:41,108
The way she called and stopped me...

231
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,949
It felt like if I didn't turn back...

232
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,849
She'd die.

233
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:47,919
No one's gonna die.

234
00:16:49,248 --> 00:16:50,519
I mean --

235
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,994
You can't be serious! He's gonna die, she's gonna die...

236
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,684
Just think about your life!

237
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,348
I have.

238
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:05,588
Sometimes, I think that without Maheen...

239
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,928
I'd die...

240
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,598
That leads me to think how he...

241
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,518
He's written hundreds of letters to Maheen in these ten years.

242
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,209
He burnt them all because of me.

243
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,134
Now, he's holding on to the ashes...

244
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,310
How does he have the letters he wrote to Maheen?

245
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,838
He never sent them.

246
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,188
He could never bring himself to.

247
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,081
He'd write them, go through them, and think he'd told Maheen everything.

248
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,931
Wow...

249
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:47,271
He never asked me to get out of the way.

250
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:51,041
He got out of the way for me.

251
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,040
What's so funny?

252
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,268
Who's the Gang Chief these days?

253
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,029
Please, Jiya...

254
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,279
I'm very serious.

255
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:14,281
I'm very serious too.

256
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,421
Who's the Chief?

257
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,959
Maheen.

258
00:18:17,989 --> 00:18:20,528
Maheen Aurangzeb.

259
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:24,248
And is he in the Gang too? Gulrez?

260
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:25,969
Maybe...

261
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,800
But it's so irrelevant.

262
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,471
Perhaps... Perhaps not?

263
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,428
I mean...

264
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,678
Maheen's my best friend...

265
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:41,417
She never told me she loves you.

266
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:42,657
Aye,

267
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,558
She always said,

268
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,520
'I'll teach him a lesson',

269
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,898
'I'll make him pay for the slap',

270
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:54,769
'Settle the scores', 'kill him off where he won't find any relief'... Stuff like that...

271
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,089
She says that when she's furious.

272
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:02,468
Your problem is not

273
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:05,468
How much Gulrez loves her.

274
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,430
Your problem

275
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,902
Is you believe

276
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,942
She loves you.

277
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:17,972
What?

278
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,428
What d'you mean?

279
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,868
You think it's completely irrelevant, don't you?

280
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:28,789
You'd do well to make sure.

281
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,759
What? Make sure of what?

282
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,092
It's so simple, Waqar.

283
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:38,608
Let her say she loves you.

284
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,698
You don't know her.

285
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,878
She'd never say that.

286
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,936
I know her, Waqar.

287
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,841
She'd never say that.

288
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:56,768
That's why I say, don't think your Gang's irrelevant.

289
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:58,532
Maybe

290
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,681
I'm wrong about it,

291
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,232
But

292
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:05,201
You should not take any chances.

293
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,038
Granted, she's got quite the ego...

294
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,208
But

295
00:20:21,278 --> 00:20:23,459
Sacrificing her love

296
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:26,279
With her silence?

297
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,038
Impossible.

298
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,748
Looking at Gulrez pains me.

299
00:21:07,318 --> 00:21:11,498
Hearing him, you'd think he isn't even from this world.

300
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:14,899
He doesn't love me.

301
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,839
He worships me.

302
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,968
But I can't help it.

303
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,609
His love and devotion are no good to me.

304
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,638
The twit's not really my type.

305
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:31,420
But the one I hated for all these years,

306
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,982
The one I planned to get even with when he'd come back...

307
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,533
I can't settle any score with him.

308
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,260
Not when I've fallen for him.

309
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,550
Can't believe it's happening, but it's real...

310
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,320
Good Lord...

311
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:00,590
If he didn't hear my call and turn back,

312
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:03,379
I swear it would've killed me.

313
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,758
Who's the Gang Chief these days?

314
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:41,338
Perhaps it's not so irrelevant?

315
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,878
Maheen's my best friend...

316
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:48,848
She never told me she loves you.

317
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,758
Why don't you tell 'em everything?

318
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:54,142
Say those fiery words

319
00:22:54,212 --> 00:22:56,940
And shatter my ego for Nano to see!

320
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,728
Aye, she always said,

321
00:22:58,728 --> 00:23:01,679
'I'll teach him a lesson',

322
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,169
'I'll make him pay for the slap'...

323
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,670
Sorry for disturbing you.

324
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,800
It's okay.

325
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,950
Grab a pew.

326
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,423
So... What is it?

327
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:43,920
You gotta write the last page for me.

328
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,978
Hmm?

329
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:50,758
Just one?

330
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:53,550
Aye.

331
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:55,519
Give me your draft.

332
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:58,770
I haven't got a draft this time.

333
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,268
I'll dictate.

334
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,160
You write.

335
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,348
Okay... No problem.

336
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,969
Write down...

337
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,988
'Everything went'

338
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,879
'As we'd planned'...

339
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:36,644
Just a minute...

340
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,180
Lemme take a look at the previous pages...

341
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,630
You took the samples with you.

342
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,340
I need a moment to study the handwriting.

343
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,573
Okay...

344
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,667
Take your time.

345
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,598
Uncle Qutb!

346
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,541
Uncle Qutb!

347
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,840
I've been screamin' at the top of my lungs! Can't you hear me?

348
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,168
Do I look like Qutb?

349
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:32,338
Want something? Go to the kitchen.

350
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,858
I'm too busy with my studies.

351
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,168
Where's Uncle Qutb?

352
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,888
With Mum.

353
00:25:41,158 --> 00:25:42,878
And where's Mum?

354
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,585
At Nano's.

355
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,435
At 1 a.m.?

356
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:51,259
Nano's orders. 'Come at once if convenient. If inconvenient come all the same'.

357
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,358
Uncle Qutb drove her because the driver's wife's sick.

358
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:57,169
Anything else?

359
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:02,454
You better have something.

360
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:05,626
Why?

361
00:26:05,717 --> 00:26:10,878
Who knows, the news from there may kill your hunger!

362
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:16,419
I've got nothing to fear. Gulrez ain't marrying me even if they all begged him.

363
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,993
You'd die for that London tramp, wouldn't you?

364
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:20,440
Can it!

365
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,815
To the dickens with him!

366
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,958
We're out of options...

367
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:40,109
Anger's not gonna do any good... Nor will soothing anyone...

368
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,288
The point, plainly,

369
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:49,909
Is that Gulrez is out of the picture.

370
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,908
My sweet Fatima's poor wee lad...

371
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,978
Go on...

372
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,308
About?

373
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,619
They've both proven

374
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,558
That Kaneez Begum is moron number one.

375
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,899
So...

376
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:29,253
You three get to decide and tell me this time.

377
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,473
No way, Ammi Begum.

378
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,839
You get to decide.

379
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,118
Why don't you say anything?

380
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:43,079
You're listening quietly as if we're talking about the neighbour's girl.

381
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,488
I've lost, Ammi Begum.

382
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,999
No one asked for your confession.

383
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,828
Confession?

384
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,078
I told you...

385
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,422
No big deal speaking English when you really need to...

386
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,880
Back to business...

387
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:08,721
Okay...

388
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,252
As it pleases the Lord.

389
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,141
As in?

390
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,751
If we can't take up arms against love...

391
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,111
There's one...

392
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,390
Against two...

393
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,320
The one...

394
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:33,851
Is entirely one-sided... Always has been...

395
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,641
Ration me rum if I understood a word Mehrunnisa just said.

396
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,031
Spiffing...

397
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,908
Get up.

398
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:56,605
Go ask Munshi Alam to get us all a cuppa.

399
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,218
Go on.

400
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,148
Are you happy with the proposal?

401
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:11,958
You wouldn't say you can't face Gulrez, would you?

402
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,389
She's talking about Waqar and Maheen.

403
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,496
Why are you still here?

404
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:28,877
This ain't for you. Go.

405
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,059
Go on, Suraiyya.

406
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:40,259
Say you accept it or that you will stand by your word to your sister.

407
00:29:43,219 --> 00:29:45,979
I can't stand by my word, Ammi Begum...

408
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:49,110
You're right...

409
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,719
Gulrez is out of the picture.

410
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,286
My sweet Fatima's poor wee lad...

411
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,248
Please don't say that... It pains me so much...

412
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:06,348
Don't stop me.

413
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,010
I'll shed a few tears every time he'd face me...

414
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,897
The poor lad...

415
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,201
I can give him my blessings... And my sympathies...

416
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,378
But his love's one-sided...

417
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,180
I can't give him his love...

418
00:30:24,078 --> 00:30:27,389
She'd rather die for Waqar Ahmed...

419
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,808
God be with ye.
-God be with ye.

420
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,896
Neelam...

421
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,398
Don't wake him up.

422
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:02,087
Put him to sleep if he gets up.

423
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,898
Ask him he's got to wait if he asks for breakfast.

424
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:12,468
If he wants to go to work, stop him.

425
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:14,178
Scold him if you must.

426
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:16,239
But why?

427
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:18,938
I've got my reasons.

428
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:20,709
Care to tell me?

429
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:22,238
I can't.

430
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,738
But don't worry.

431
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,899
It'll be out soon...

432
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,779
You'll find out later today.

433
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:34,869
I hope you've got sleeping pills...

434
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,620
Give him one in his tea.

435
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:41,038
What is it?

436
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,233
It's nothing, really...

437
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,680
Just...

438
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,308
My intuition...

439
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,598
A gut feeling that warns me...

440
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:55,438
About?

441
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,858
I'd rather not want to say it.

442
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,008
God be with ye.

443
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,199
Peace be upon you, Nano.

444
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:24,985
And upon you, peace.

445
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:28,709
Had breakfast?

446
00:32:28,804 --> 00:32:30,224
No.

447
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:32,104
Just sent Wali to work.

448
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,760
Gulrez is sleeping.

449
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,399
I'll have breakfast when he gets up. We eat together.

450
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,825
Okay...

451
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,348
I'll get back to you

452
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:44,438
After breakfast.

453
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,389
Please, go on.

454
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,777
I don't want to wait until breakfast!

455
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,528
You'd better.

456
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,138
Plus, that twit's sleeping...

457
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:58,828
When he gets up, ask him

458
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,768
If he can augur.

459
00:33:02,335 --> 00:33:03,828
Augur?

460
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:07,978
Back in our day, we could.

461
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,872
We may not love as much...

462
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:15,409
But we'd augur much more... But it seems now...

463
00:33:15,473 --> 00:33:17,724
What is there to augur about?

464
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,748
What is it, Nano?

465
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,588
How do I tell you, love?

466
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:26,214
Wali's not around...

467
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,411
Gulrez's asleep...

468
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,380
You're out there all alone...

469
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,090
What if something happened to you?

470
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,087
Don't worry.

471
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,579
I know you're brave.

472
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,908
But bravery, my dear,

473
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,198
Can only last so long.

474
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:50,988
Tell me...

475
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:55,038
When was the last time you cried?

476
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,988
I don't cry now.

477
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:02,118
You're off form, so to speak...

478
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,544
In that case, you better have breakfast first...

479
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:10,678
Get back to me when you've had breakfast.

480
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,232
I'll tell you everything

481
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,871
If the Lord wills thus...

482
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,958
Hello?

483
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:50,737
You're marrying Maheen to Waqar?

484
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,338
Me sainted uncle...

485
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:56,399
That's some fine augury...

486
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,938
I mean, just think about it.

487
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:02,328
It's that poor twit who loves her,

488
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:05,039
But you're the one auguring.

489
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,560
Because I love him, Nano.

490
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,171
Look...

491
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:15,250
You better not start crying now.

492
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,098
Just think I'm helpless...

493
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:28,897
No truth can conceal your grey-haired lies better than the truth of your helplessness...

494
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,497
You're there, aren't you?

495
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:37,108
Yeah.

496
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,488
Promise me...

497
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,909
You'll have your breakfast like nothing happened

498
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,484
And tell him cheerfully, with a smile -

499
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:52,996
'She' --

500
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,868
'She didn't deserve your love... She wanted a loafer layabout like herself'!

501
00:36:00,178 --> 00:36:02,488
Aren't you sending us sweets?

502
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,159
Wha -- Sweets?

503
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:10,393
You're not brave either.

504
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,990
You will need to be, Nano.

505
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,981
Good news ain't good without sweets.

506
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,729
Please, send us some.

507
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,510
I'll wake Gulrez up.

508
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:27,968
Hold your horses, Neelam, or he'll die under their weight!

509
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:30,408
He's already dead.

510
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,490
He gave his life without an ounce of fear.

511
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,630
I'm just cross as two sticks to wonder

512
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,950
Why he couldn't augur and see the writing on the wall at all!

513
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
