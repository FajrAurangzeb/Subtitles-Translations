1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Umm...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Return the photocopy?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Photocopy?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He thinks I've fallen for him'...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The poor prat'!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If this be love, dear'...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'May you'

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Groan in agony'...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Amour"' (Love),

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Je te déteste"' (I hate you)...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Photocopy...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To let me know

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you need anything.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give your Mum the phone.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, Aunt May.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum! It's Nano!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Ammi Begum?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa scoffed at me.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did it hurt you?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe it!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When an otherwise-duteous daughter-in-law scoffs at you...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The mother-in-law should admit she's ruined everything.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't give in before her.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I blamed everything on the blighter!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Suraiyya,

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got a point.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broke too many hearts to keep my word...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That actually you, Ammi Begum?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's your Aunt May!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last night...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw it myself.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw just how much they love each other.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Die if separated.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd been cruel to you once...

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I got you married to that wretched Aurangzeb...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You took it quietly...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I wonder

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Maheen would take it lying down too.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much longer can I make my family gulp down this poison? How much longer can I reign supreme?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got to be fair for a change... Concede my defeat before love sometime...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got to admit that love - even between two twits -

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dwarfs our authority.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Gulrez?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about him?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What about him?</i>

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It happens when love is one-sided...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You get hunger, not food...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, bye...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hang up already! I'm tearing up!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm crying for the one

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd slapped hard last night.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you comfort me?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say I'm not all that bad?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's hard to find a mother and friend like you in the world.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, Suraiyya.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're speaking English?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay if you really have to, sometimes!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now --

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please hang up...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before he slips away.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Maheen?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gone to see someone.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar said he was just taking her for a ride last night.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that he doesn't really love her at all.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what's she gonna tell Gulrez?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps even tell him everything and say... 'Good riddance'!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good riddance?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good riddance of someone who couldn't appreciate how much he's loved!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, don't stop her.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her have it her way.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said as she left,

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Love's pointless'.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Matches are made in Heaven'.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop her!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her! Ammi Begum's happy!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if it makes any difference.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The man she turned the engagement down for refused.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd die but never marry him!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he happy?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit was lying!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone must've told him to --

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Nobody told her to do anything though.</i>

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fix an auspicious date with Ammi Begum.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After the call last night,

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even I've accepted

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez as my brother-in-law to-be!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless him, will you?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so quiet?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good news.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The tramp from London refused.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't marrying me!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This ain't good news for me.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd call it bad news.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The separation of lovers

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Makes the ground tremble.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like an earthquake!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And - who knows - that's why earthquakes are a thing.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh please. Nothing's gonna happen!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't even love me!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He swore before Nano, Uncle, Aunt, and Munshi Alam!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was lying.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone made him say it.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like this 'someone' to try me!

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take a while to appreciate the solemn vows of love.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovers

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are given to pitying.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had pity on me.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear that, Neelam?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's bewitched!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Absolutely.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only a true sorcerer

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could sacrifice his love for his corrival and say he's leaving for London.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's leaving for London?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he didn't already.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, it's essential

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For his spell to work!

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well guess what, I've begun to loathe him!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know that.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blow hot and cold too often.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One cold lie...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you got all hot-headed.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But tell me...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if he actually turned you down,

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could that ever change love into loathing?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You turned someone down too.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the day of the engagement.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You refused to wear the ring.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't loathe you one bit.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is it that your love

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grows to loathe your love so quickly?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask me...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If that's how you define love,

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd loathe it too.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her finish.
-I won't.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been gravely wronged!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had pity on me!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There can be no greater insult than pitying a lover.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't stay quiet.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell him everything.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called him over.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Showed him my letters to Maheen.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave him reason to have pity.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Swear by me if I'm lying.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've burnt every single one of them.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Charred my treasure to ashes because he had pity on me.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how much it's hurt me.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How low I've fallen...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Neelam's fault.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She cried before him.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He had mercy on me.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So please, tell me...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If someone had mercy on lovers,

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which upright man out there would dare to fall in love?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't hear much about love of late,

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So don't humiliate

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rare man who's fallen in love.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Foxy's leading your wedding procession.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Foxy's gonna lead my wedding procession.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your Foxy's gonna lead my wedding procession.
In the tale of love</i>

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love...</i>

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from...</i>

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart...</i>

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel so guilty, Jiya.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love Maheen so much, but...

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to marry her.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor little Gulrez...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves her much more than I ever can.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may die

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the day of our wedding.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk about Maheen.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who does she love?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never said it, but...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know there's something between us.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way she called and stopped me...

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It felt like if I didn't turn back...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd die.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's gonna die.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be serious! He's gonna die, she's gonna die...

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think about your life!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I think that without Maheen...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That leads me to think how he...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's written hundreds of letters to Maheen in these ten years.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He burnt them all because of me.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, he's holding on to the ashes...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How does he have the letters he wrote to Maheen?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never sent them.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He could never bring himself to.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd write them, go through them, and think he'd told Maheen everything.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never asked me to get out of the way.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got out of the way for me.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's so funny?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's the Gang Chief these days?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Jiya...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very serious.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very serious too.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's the Chief?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And is he in the Gang too? Gulrez?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's so irrelevant.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps... Perhaps not?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's my best friend...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never told me she loves you.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always said,

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll teach him a lesson',

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll make him pay for the slap',

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Settle the scores', 'kill him off where he won't find any relief'... Stuff like that...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says that when she's furious.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your problem is not

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much Gulrez loves her.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your problem

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is you believe

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves you.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think it's completely irrelevant, don't you?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd do well to make sure.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? Check what?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so simple, Waqar.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her say she loves you.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know her.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd never say that.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know her, Waqar.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd never say that.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I say, don't think your Gang's irrelevant.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm wrong about it,

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should not take any chances.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granted, she's got quite the ego...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sacrificing her love

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With her silence?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Impossible.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at Gulrez pains me.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hearing him, you'd think he isn't even from this world.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't love me.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He worships me.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't help it.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His love and devotion are no good to me.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit's not really my type.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the one I hated for all these years,

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one I planned to get even with when he'd come back...

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't settle any score with him.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not when I've fallen for him.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe it's happening, but it's real...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he didn't hear my call and turn back,

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear it would've killed me.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's the Gang Chief these days?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps it's not so irrelevant?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's my best friend...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never told me she loves you.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you tell 'em everything?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say those fiery words

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And shatter my ego for Nano to see!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye,

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always said,

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll teach him a lesson',

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll make him pay for the slap'...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry for disturbing you.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a seat.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What is it?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta write the last page for me.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me your draft.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't got a draft this time.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll dictate.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You write.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... No problem.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Write down...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Everything went'

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'As we'd planned'...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme take a look at the previous pages...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You took the samples with you.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need a moment to study the handwriting.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take your time.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Qutb!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Qutb!

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been screamin' at the top of my lungs! Can't you hear me?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I look like Qutb?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want something? Go to the kitchen.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm too busy with my studies.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Uncle Qutb?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With Mum.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And where's Mum?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At Nano's.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At 1 a.m.?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's orders. 'Come at once if convenient. If inconvenient come all the same'.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Qutb drove her because the driver's wife's sick.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything else?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better have something.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, the news from there may kill your hunger!

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got nothing to fear. Gulrez ain't marrying mere even if they all begged him.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd die for that London tramp, wouldn't you?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the dickens with him!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're out of options...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anger's not gonna do any good... Nor will soothing anyone...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The point, plainly,

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that Gulrez is out of the picture.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My sweet Fatima's poor wee lad...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've both proven

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Kaneez Begum is moron number one.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You three get to decide and tell me this time.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Ammi Begum.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You get to decide.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say anything?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're listening quietly as if we're talking about the neighbour's girl.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've lost, Ammi Begum.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one asked for your confession.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Confession?

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you...

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No big deal speaking English when you really need to...

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to business...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As it pleases the Lord.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If we can't take up arms against love...

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's one...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Against two...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is entirely one-sided... Always has been...

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ration my rum if I understood what Mehrunnisa just said.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go ask Munshi Alam to get us all a cuppa.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you happy with the proposal?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wouldn't say you can't face Gulrez, would you?

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's talking about Waqar and Maheen.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you still here?

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This ain't for you. Go.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on, Suraiyya.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say you accept it or that you will stand by your word to your sister.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't stand by my word, Ammi Begum...

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right...

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez is out of the picture.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My sweet Fatima's poor wee lad...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't say that... It pains me so much...

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't stop me.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll shed a few tears every time he'd face me...

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor lad...

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can give him my blessings... And my sympathies...

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But his love's one-sided...

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't give him his love...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd rather die for Waqar Ahmed...

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God be with ye.
-God be with ye.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam...

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't wake him up.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put him to sleep if he gets up.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him he's got to wait if he asks for breakfast.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he wants to go to work, stop him.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scold him if you must.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got my reasons.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be out soon...

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find out later today.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you've got sleeping pills...

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give him one in his tea.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing, really...

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My intuition...

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A gut feeling that warns me...

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather not want to say it.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God be with ye.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Nano.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had breakfast?

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just sent Wali to work.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez is sleeping.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have breakfast when he gets up. We eat together.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After breakfast.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to wait until breakfast!

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plus, that twit's sleeping...

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When he gets up, ask him

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he can augur.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Augur?

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back in our day, we could.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We may not love as much...

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we'd augur much more... But it seems now...

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is there to augur about?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it, Nano?

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I tell you, love?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali's not around...

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's asleep...

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're out there all alone...

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if something happened to you?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you're brave.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But bravery, my dear,

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can only last so long.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When was the last time you cried?

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't cry now.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're off form, so to speak...

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, you better have breakfast first...

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get back to me when you've had breakfast.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you everything

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the Lord wills thus...

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're marrying Maheen to Waqar?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's some fine augury...

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just think about it.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's that poor twit who loves her,

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're the one auguring.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I love him, Nano.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not start crying now.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think I'm helpless...

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No truth can conceal your grey-haired lies better than the truth of your helplessness...

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're there, aren't you?

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me...

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll have your breakfast like nothing happened

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell him cheerfully, with a smile -

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'She' --

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'She didn't deserve your love... She wanted a loafer layabout like herself'!

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you sending us sweets?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wha -- Sweets?

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not brave either.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will need to be, Nano.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good news ain't good without sweets.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, send us some.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll wake Gulrez up.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, Neelam, or he'll die under their weight!

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's already dead.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gave his life without an ounce of fear.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just cross as two sticks to wonder

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why he couldn't augur and see the writing on the wall at all!

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
