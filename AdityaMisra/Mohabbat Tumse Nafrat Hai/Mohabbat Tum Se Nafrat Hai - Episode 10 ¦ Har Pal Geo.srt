1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it with you.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't dare touch it either.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take all the time you want in one shot

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And think over it.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He thinks I'm insulting him...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?
-No...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says you only need to ask...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he'd give you a hundred years...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, that's cute...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you get me a cuppa or...?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. I'll brew it myself.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum... Mind if I ask something?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mind you speaking English. As does Ammi Begum.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright... Mind if I ask something?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it normal in families?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elders wanting the kids not to make peace.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you talking about?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- A general question. For my knowledge.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean Maheen and Waqar?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, you're smart, Mum.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not all that much.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a bit difficult, aye...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surprising.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The decisions of the elders are wise. Prudent.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all you need to know.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you said God's decisions are wise.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Clam up!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My mouth, yes.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never my eyes and ears.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the Gang, we say,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The game's a bit dodgy'!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you go there?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is not for the beggars!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovers do not go about with a bowl...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Begging, 'Please, Maheen Aurangzeb',

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Give me a bit of your love for the love of God'!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is not a malady

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you look for someone who can cure it.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love her.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I take pride in the fact.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I take pride in the fact that she doesn't love me back,

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because love is so courteous as to give the right to refuse.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't refuse.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wanted time, yes?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For all I care,

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can take a hundred years!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would still have time to give her

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even when I'm not around.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we had to talk to her. Ask her. Just once.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been asked once.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've talked to her once.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking her... Talking to her a second time... Is like begging!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear to God,

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want Maheen in charity.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get all worked-up and furious.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls have all sorts of problems.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some don't like to let love near their selves.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some love but keep it locked in their hearts.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And some -

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like Maheen -

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't love anyone, but...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe in love.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just doesn't know who deserves her love.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One's got to get to know her heart...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a good look...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'd gone to her.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to make sure there's no one else in her heart.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I assure you, there's no one.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does that mean

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even see me?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar's here!

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back inside!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why I'm here?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everything.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to make peace with Maheen.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa!
-Don't 'whoa' me!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll say sorry if I have to.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even brought flowers.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And perfume.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Try her.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gimme the flowers.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What --

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt! Stop it!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think you're doing?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not like you.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm following my orders.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't set foot in here until you're ready to marry Jiya.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who in the world ordered you?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else could it be?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I won't tell you that.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ought to say that too.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you look too splendid to be making peace?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd rather have you two up in arms.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't expect me

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To let you in or something.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're forgetting something. You're my Aunt. You love me so much.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've forgotten everything, m'boy!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been ordered

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to care about who you are to me.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's who you are today - no one!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even know you!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, if I got furious --
-Aye? What are you gonna do?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't set foot in here!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one over here

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gives two hoots.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get going!

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to your Dado!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, Maheen...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought flowers for you.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And some perfume.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he wanted to make peace.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he was ready to hear everything you'd say quietly.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the flowers? And the perfume?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum destroyed the flowers

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And threw the perfume in the lawn.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she won't let him in

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until he's ready to marry Jiya.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano told her. I'm sure.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with Nano? Doesn't she want the kids making peace?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme have a look.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhm...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Suraiyya.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was here.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With flowers and perfume.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you ask how I dealt with him?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray tell.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Threw it in the lawn and didn't let him set foot inside!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said,

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't forget you're my Aunt'!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You love me so much'!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wanted to make you all sentimental about it...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I didn't give in.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'You're no one'!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get out'!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did he?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promptly.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Spiffing.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may've just saved the family's honour today, dear.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... Tell me...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he doesn't want to marry Jiya,

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How does that dishonour our family?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you someday...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've done as you asked... Couldn't you tell me now?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does Maheen know he was here?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does know how he left.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd she react?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was laughing.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Howling. Doubling up.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now she's suckin' diesel!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're safe now.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Safe from?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even ask about it...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sick!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sick enough I had to kick him out!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Venture a guess...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Munshi Alam said his important thing...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you remember it?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he say?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said, 'Ask him'

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Who'd you marry if not Jiya'?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you tell me the answer to that?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- He won't actually marry her --

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But who d'you think he'd name?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd I know?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do, Suraiyya Begum.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His mind may be English,

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can read it in Urdu.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've reached 73 raising kids like him...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd he name?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sitting or standing?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Standing, Ammi Begum.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a seat.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell anyone.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your dearest

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, of course!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just say sorry?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, forgive me this one time?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

222
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,268
Don't think I mean it when I say sorry.

223
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,919
Everything's fair in love and war.

224
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,459
But what happens in love

225
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,190
Happens not in war, Neelam.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, though.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got her to hear it!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you could never say!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm starving.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like to have dinner.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam was here today.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She asked me

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I ever went to buy a book

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And bought perfume instead.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said, 'Don't get the perfume this time'.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get the book'.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Just for once'...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Go through one of its pages'...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If you think it isn't worth it',

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get all the perfume you want'.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Books

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't have that sweet scent...

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A good read

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is redolent

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With sweet words...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is why, this time,

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel I ought to get the book

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead of the perfume!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But whenever I think about it...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you show up in the way?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step aside!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of my way!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back where you came from!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner, Neelam!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honestly knackered.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's thinking. You're waiting.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder how you would doze off.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the limit...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Neelam...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she left your birthday party,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurt me so much.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether or not she's thinking...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether she asks for time... Or gives us some...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can doze off...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite peacefully, actually...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're about to get your answer.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a feeling she won't take time. Or refuse.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't believe me?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I like about her.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She kills...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never gives anyone false hope.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what you're made of...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so hopeful since you met her...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good, though...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's changing...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner?

285
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:56,659
ADD

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
