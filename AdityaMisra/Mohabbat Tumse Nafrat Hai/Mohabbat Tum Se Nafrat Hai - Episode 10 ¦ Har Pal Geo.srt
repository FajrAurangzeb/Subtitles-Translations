1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it with you.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't dare touch it either.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take all the time you want in one shot

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And think over it.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He thinks I'm insulting him...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?
-No...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says you only need to ask...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he'd give you a hundred years...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, that's cute...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you get me a cuppa or...?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. I'll brew it myself.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum... Mind if I ask something?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mind you speaking English. As does Ammi Begum.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright... Mind if I ask something?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it normal in families?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elders wanting the kids not to make peace.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you talking about?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- A general question. For my knowledge.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean Maheen and Waqar?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, you're smart, Mum.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not all that much.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a bit difficult, aye...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surprising.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The decisions of the elders are wise. Prudent.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's all you need to know.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you said God's decisions are wise.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Clam up!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My mouth, yes.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never my eyes and ears.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the Gang, we say,

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The game's a bit dodgy'!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you go there?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is not for the beggars!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovers do not go about with a bowl...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Begging, 'Please, Maheen Aurangzeb',

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Give me a bit of your love for the love of God'!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is not a malady

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you look for someone who can cure it.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love her.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I take pride in the fact.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I take pride in the fact that she doesn't love me back,

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because love is so courteous as to give the right to refuse.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't refuse.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wanted time, yes?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For all I care,

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can take a hundred years!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would still have time to give her

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even when I'm not around.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think we had to talk to her. Ask her. Just once.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been asked once.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've talked to her once.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking her... Talking to her a second time... Is like begging!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear to God,

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want Maheen in charity.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get all worked-up and furious.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls have all sorts of problems.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some don't like to let love near their selves.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Some love but keep it locked in their hearts.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And some -

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like Maheen -

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't love anyone, but...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Believe in love.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just doesn't know who deserves her love.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One's got to get to know her heart...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a good look...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'd gone to her.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to make sure there's no one else in her heart.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I assure you, there's no one.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does that mean

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even see me?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar's here!

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back inside!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why I'm here?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everything.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to make peace with Maheen.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa!
-Don't 'whoa' me!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll say sorry if I have to.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even brought flowers.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And perfume.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Try her.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gimme the flowers.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What --

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt! Stop it!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think you're doing?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not like you.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm following my orders.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't set foot in here until you're ready to marry Jiya.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who in the world ordered you?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else could it be?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I won't tell you that.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ought to say that too.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you look too splendid to be making peace?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd rather have you two up in arms.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't expect me

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To let you in or something.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're forgetting something. You're my Aunt. You love me so much.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've forgotten everything, m'boy!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been ordered

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to care about who you are to me.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's who you are today - no one!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even know you!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, if I got furious --
-Aye? What are you gonna do?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't set foot in here!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one over here

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gives two hoots.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get going!

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to your Dado!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, Maheen...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought flowers for you.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And some perfume.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he wanted to make peace.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he was ready to hear everything you'd say quietly.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the flowers? And the perfume?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum destroyed the flowers

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And threw the perfume in the lawn.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she won't let him in

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until he's ready to marry Jiya.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano told her. I'm sure.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with Nano? Doesn't she want the kids making peace?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme have a look.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhm...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Suraiyya.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was here.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With flowers and perfume.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you ask how I dealt with him?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray tell.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Threw it in the lawn and didn't let him set foot inside!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said,

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't forget you're my Aunt'!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You love me so much'!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wanted to make you all sentimental about it...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I didn't give in.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'You're no one'!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get out'!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did he?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promptly.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Spiffing.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may've just saved the family's honour today, dear.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... Tell me...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he doesn't want to marry Jiya,

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How does that dishonour our family?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell you someday...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've done as you asked... Couldn't you tell me now?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does Maheen know he was here?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does know how he left.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd she react?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was laughing.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Howling. Doubling up.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now she's suckin' diesel!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're safe now.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Safe from?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even ask about it...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sick!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sick enough I had to kick him out!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Venture a guess...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Munshi Alam said his important thing...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you remember it?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he say?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said, 'Ask him'

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Who'd you marry if not Jiya'?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you tell me the answer to that?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- He won't actually marry her --

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But who d'you think he'd name?

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd I know?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do, Suraiyya Begum.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His mind may be English,

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can read it in Urdu.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've reached 73 raising kids like him...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd he name?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sitting or standing?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Standing, Ammi Begum.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a seat.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell anyone.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your dearest

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, of course!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just say sorry?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, forgive me this one time?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

222
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,268
Don't think I mean it when I say sorry.

223
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,919
Everything's fair in love and war.

224
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,459
But what happens in love

225
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,190
Happens not in war, Neelam.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, though.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got her to hear it!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you could never say!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm starving.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like to have dinner.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam was here today.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She asked me

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I ever went to buy a book

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And bought perfume instead.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said, 'Don't get the perfume this time'.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get the book'.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Just for once'...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Go through one of its pages'...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If you think it isn't worth it',

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Get all the perfume you want'.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Books

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't have that sweet scent...

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A good read

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is redolent

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With sweet words...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is why, this time,

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel I ought to get the book

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead of the perfume!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But whenever I think about it...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you show up in the way?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step aside!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of my way!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back where you came from!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner, Neelam!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honestly knackered.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's thinking. You're waiting.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder how you would doze off.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the limit...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Neelam...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she left your birthday party,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurt me so much.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether or not she's thinking...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether she asks for time... Or gives us some...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can doze off...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite peacefully, actually...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart says

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're about to get your answer.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a feeling she won't take time. Or refuse.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't believe me?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I like about her.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She kills...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never gives anyone false hope.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what you're made of...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so hopeful since you met her...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good, though...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's changing...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Dado's got a big problem...

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thinks of something

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And wants it followed like a commandment.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She asked me, I said no,

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she still called you!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you say no?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you say yes?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what Fajr told her after you left?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love me.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like she's wrong.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe that's what you think.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe... You don't even deserve to be loved.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not fit for love.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good answer.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I brought you here to tell you

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That whatever Dado said

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was not my decision.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you've come crawling back!

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum came...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You crawled back!

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem, Waqar Ahmed?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like I'm dying for you.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just that Ammi Begum called with a proposal...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I've got to get married.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're friends.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't too bad after all.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you said you don't want to.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want either! I don't care!

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got your wallet?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eh?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget to pay the bill.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, Ammi Begum.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's he gonna say with his head in your lap?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya knows what he's gonna say.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't the foggiest.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God knows what he'd say...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it mean to surrender completely?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He surrendered?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Course, my dear...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who concede

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have to accept all the conditions of the victor.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's the victor?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Absolutely spiffing, Mehru.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he surrendered to me,

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you think is the victor but me?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves someone else.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I think.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can't happen in ten years?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dare him.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you gonna do?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said we're having roasted aubergine. So we will. Willy-nilly.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't try to get anything else on the stove.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it, Ammi Begum.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you get?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't like roasted aubergine.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you gonna tell Jiya?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've given her my word.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Made a promise too.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna honour it.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call her father?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell him?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me sort things out here first.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter may not have won,

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he hasn't quite surrendered yet.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya's very nice.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely too.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what Waqar's looking for.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray he doesn't do something crooked!

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rascals like himself would nag you to get them the moon to play with one day.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have to talk to Jiya...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Assure her...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or she'd think the old lady went back on her word...

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Sup? Here to pull me up again?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, partner!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just here to tell you you've succeeded!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get it?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Smell something?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm wearing your perfume, mate!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much!

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Truce?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you do something for me?
-Yeah?

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marry Jiya.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just friends with Jiya.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's precisely why, Sherlock!

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It takes a while to make friends with your wife. She's already your friend!

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you possibly hope for better?

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You here to say that?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One more thing...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you make a place for yourself in someone's heart, learn to stay there.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't learn it that easy in London,

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But girls' hearts are not leaseholds

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you can leave

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At your leisure.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye,

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're friends!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit... When we've talked to you,

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When we said he's gonna marry you,

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you need to listen to his cock and bull stories?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's given you her word.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over anytime you want.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See him. See us all you want.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you stay before his eyes,

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll begin to make your place in them.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way,

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know how to play cricket?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ammi Begum...

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you learn it?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call me coach! I'll train you!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I want to learn to play cricket?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he absolutely loves cricket.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves to play with the ladies!

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Learn to play, wager everything, and win him over!

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say he's all yours.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ammi Begum.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And to be honest, I don't want him either.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were so delighted to hear the proposal the other day!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I liked how you proposed to me.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gimme the phone...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme talk to her.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, matey.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even ask.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you refuse?

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout you tell me

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you want to force Waqar on me?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you find someone else for him?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You saw him?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of these days?

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What good is it?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it something he said?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He isn't fit to be loved, mate!

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even think of a man so unfit!

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please find someone else for him.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're hiding something, aren't you?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I'm not.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't suit me.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's nice. Sweet.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But just sweet and nice doesn't do it.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to you later.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell Ammi Begum I'm sorry again.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said sorry.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you make a place for yourself in someone's heart, learn to stay there.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't learn it that easy in London,

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But girls' hearts are not leaseholds

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you can leave

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At your leisure.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you were not sleeping.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just about to sleep.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm awake.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya, let's... Discuss the proposal?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What proposal?

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's proposal?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That chapter's closed.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told Ammi Begum you're unfit to be loved.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course not.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I be?

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You thought you couldn't love me.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought, too,

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't possibly love <i>you</i>!</i>

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can we forget yesterday's convo for a moment?

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen said

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ought to marry you.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least she gave me something to think about.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I think she was right.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to you tomorrow?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why tomorrow?

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm knackered.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at me.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We need to talk.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You made peace with Waqar?

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why?

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be in sin if I didn't.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shook hands with him too?

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We made peace. Became friends. It's but natural!

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what he's gonna do.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ask me.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you tell Neelam?

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me about what Neelam asked me!

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what she'd ask you.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what you said.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked her to read my diary.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd find all her answers in it.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's in your diary?

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've written that I want to fall in love with Gulrez.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll marry him the moment I do.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get married.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fall in love when you want.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be serious!

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it plainly.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You kicked her out!

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked for time. Now you're showing her your diary. What else are you gonna show us?

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're in the mood for a fight, Mum!

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not with you!

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fighting myself.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't seem to budge.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Ammi Begum

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Says all sorts of things...

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sort that'd give you sleepless nights!

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That why you're up?

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget about sleeping.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me plainly...

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much more time do you want?

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just decide in one go

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell me exactly

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many days, months, or years you want!

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say, that's some fine Queen's English!

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just answer my question!

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more than...

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A couple of days?

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a couple of years if you want,

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For all I care!

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't you dare refuse, Maheen!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or there will be blood!

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to your diary.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask you in a few days.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado says girls are like birds.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Playful...

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gourmands...

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd fly away in a flash!

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't that silly, you know.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this is something I don't quite get.

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm pretty sure you don't get it either.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You live in London.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear it's a proper nightmare to find a girl there.

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's millions of English roses there.

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who says you need to look for one?

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says you only find chits there.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe one or two ladies among the lot... But that's about it.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, ask her

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How she defines a lady.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked her.

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said, 'A lady keeps her dreams locked safely within her heart',

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And lets unfulfilled dreams'

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Flow away with the dripping oceans of her eyes'...

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why are you telling me any of this?

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're (in)famous for making friends with girls.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado says boys and girls ain't never just friends.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it ain't proper to marry your friend.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Proper?

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's weird.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not, Waqar. I mean, look at it this way...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can be friends with many girls.

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you can be with many boys.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it proper?

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt?

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here alone on Sunday?

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

578
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,698
I know why girls are like birds.

579
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,158
Cage them,

580
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,728
Send them from one branch to another,

581
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,678
Or one country to another...

582
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,337
They'd accept their fate

583
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,928
Quietly.

584
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
