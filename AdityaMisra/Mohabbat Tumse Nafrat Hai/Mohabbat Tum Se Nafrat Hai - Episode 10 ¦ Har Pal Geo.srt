1
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,677
Here.

2
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:16,309
Keep it with you.

3
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:19,643
I don't dare touch it either.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,859
Take all the time you want in one shot

5
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:28,307
And think over it.

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,947
He thinks I'm insulting him...

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,854
Innit?
-No...

8
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:42,538
He says you only need to ask...

9
00:00:43,758 --> 00:00:46,188
And he'd give you a hundred years...

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,148
Wow, that's cute...

11
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,958
Would you get me a cuppa or...?

12
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:58,179
Of course. I'll brew it myself.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,160
Mum... Mind if I ask something?

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,438
I do.

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,139
I mind you speaking English. As does Ammi Begum.

16
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,910
Alright... Mind if I ask something?

17
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,098
Go on.

18
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,528
Is it normal in families?

19
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:25,419
Elders wanting the kids not to make peace.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,228
Who are you talking about?

21
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,318
No one.

22
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,108
Just -- Curious...

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,878
You mean Maheen and Waqar?

24
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:42,779
Whoa, you're smart, Mum.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,318
Not all that much.

26
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,152
It's a bit difficult, aye...

27
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,512
I mean...

28
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:52,462
Surprising.

29
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,822
The decisions of the elders are wise. Prudent.

30
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,403
That's all you need to know.

31
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:02,620
I thought you said God's decisions are wise.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,668
Clam up!

33
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,549
My mouth, aye.

34
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:09,729
But never my eyes and ears.

35
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,489
In the Gang, we say,

36
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,200
'The game's a bit dodgy'!

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,368
Why'd you go there?

38
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,157
Love is not for the beggars!

39
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,011
Lovers do not go about with a bowl...

40
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:44,160
Begging, 'Please, Maheen Aurangzeb',

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,221
'Give me a bit of your love for the love of God'!

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,628
Love is not a malady

43
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,988
That you look for someone who can cure it.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,468
I love her.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,928
I take pride in the fact.

46
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,120
And I take pride in the fact that she doesn't love me back,

47
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,160
Because love is so courteous as to give the right to refuse.

48
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,802
She didn't refuse.

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,867
She wanted time, aye?

50
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:21,593
For all I care,

51
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:24,154
She can take a hundred years!

52
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,911
I would still have time to give her

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Even when I'm not around.

54
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,139
Gulrez...

55
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,180
I think we had to talk to her. Ask her. Just once.

56
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,406
You didn't.

57
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,341
She's been asked once.

58
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,840
We've talked to her once.

59
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:55,205
Asking her... Talking to her a second time... Is like begging!

60
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,889
I swear to God,

61
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,338
I don't even want Maheen in charity.

62
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,711
Gulrez...

63
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:30,988
Don't get all worked-up and furious.

64
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,698
Girls have all sorts of problems.

65
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:40,142
Some don't like to let love near their selves.

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,327
Some love but keep it locked in their hearts.

67
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,727
And some -

68
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,507
Like Maheen -

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,702
Don't love anyone, but...

70
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,233
Believe in love.

71
00:04:56,311 --> 00:05:00,268
She just doesn't know who deserves <i>her</i> love.

72
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,900
One's got to get to know her heart...

73
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:08,855
Take a good look...

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,149
That's why I'd gone to her.

75
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,973
I wanted to make sure there's no one else in her heart.

76
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,949
And I assure you, there's no one.

77
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,933
Does that mean

78
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,120
You didn't even see me?

79
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,271
Fajr!

80
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:28,728
Where are you off to?

81
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:30,518
Waqar's here!

82
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,878
Back inside!

83
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,549
Peace, Aunt.

84
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:03,100
Upon you too.

85
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,748
Know why I'm here?

86
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,568
I know everything.

87
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,120
You want to make peace with Maheen.

88
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,008
Whoa!
-Don't 'whoa' me!

89
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:12,740
You can't.

90
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,790
Don't worry. I'll say sorry if I have to.

91
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,577
I even brought flowers.

92
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:18,718
And perfume.

93
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,162
Try her.

94
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,547
Gimme the flowers.

95
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,720
Aunt!

96
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,573
What --

97
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:25,600
What are you doing?

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,450
Aunt!

99
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,881
Aunt! Stop it!

100
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:28,676
Wh --

101
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:30,600
What d'you think you're doing?

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,684
I'm not like you.

103
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:35,086
I'm following my orders.

104
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,027
Get out.

105
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:40,660
And don't set foot in here until you're ready to marry Jiya.

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,630
Who in the world ordered you?

107
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,301
Who else could it be?

108
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,782
But I won't tell you that.

109
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:47,825
Splendid...

110
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:49,810
I ought to say that too.

111
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,480
Don't you look too splendid to be making peace?

112
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,040
No way.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,821
We'd rather have you two up in arms.

114
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:00,750
What are you looking at?

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,141
Go back.

116
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,941
Don't expect me

117
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,891
To let you in or something.

118
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,498
You're forgetting something. You're my Aunt. You love me so much.

119
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:12,829
I've forgotten everything, m'boy!

120
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,309
I've been ordered

121
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,689
Not to care about who you are to me.

122
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,948
That's who you are today - no one!

123
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,588
I don't even know you!

124
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,409
I tell you, if I got furious --
-Aye? What are you gonna do?

125
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,701
I --

126
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,718
I won't set foot in here!

127
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,018
Don't.

128
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:39,609
No one over here

129
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,162
Gives two hoots.

130
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,088
Get going!

131
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:48,230
Back to your Dado!

132
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,989
Double time!

133
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,011
Okay, bye.

134
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:01,311
Bye.

135
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,848
I swear, Maheen...

136
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,770
He brought flowers for you.

137
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,554
And some perfume.

138
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,108
He said he wanted to make peace.

139
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,518
He said he was ready to hear everything you'd say quietly.

140
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:39,868
Where's the flowers? And the perfume?

141
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:41,718
Mum destroyed the flowers

142
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:44,262
And threw the perfume in the lawn.

143
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:45,443
But why?

144
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:47,960
She said she won't let him in

145
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,208
Until he's ready to marry Jiya.

146
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:53,488
Nano told her. I'm sure.

147
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:55,159
So what?

148
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,848
What's up with Nano? Doesn't she want the kids making peace?

149
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,901
Wait.

150
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,705
Lemme have a look.

151
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,919
Hmm!

152
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,840
Mhm...

153
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,618
Hello?

154
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,192
It's Suraiyya.

155
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,088
Go on.

156
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,458
He was here.

157
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,329
With flowers and perfume.

158
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,249
Told you!

159
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:39,548
Won't you ask how I dealt with him?

160
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,298
Pray tell.

161
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:45,960
Threw it in the lawn and didn't let him set foot inside!

162
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,868
Good.

163
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,100
He said,

164
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,278
'Don't forget you're my Aunt'!

165
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,021
Hmm...

166
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,352
'You love me so much'!

167
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,338
He wanted to make you all sentimental about it...

168
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:00,558
I know.

169
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,725
But I didn't give in.

170
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,050
I said, 'You're no one'!

171
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,299
'Get out'!

172
00:12:06,344 --> 00:12:07,580
Did he?

173
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,591
Promptly.

174
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,732
Spiffing.

175
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,901
You may've just saved the family's honour today, dear.

176
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,367
But... Tell me...

177
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:20,947
If he doesn't want to marry Jiya,

178
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,728
How does that dishonour our family?

179
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,976
I'll tell you someday...

180
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,478
I've done as you asked... Couldn't you tell me now?

181
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:31,448
Tell me...

182
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:34,583
Does Maheen know he was here?

183
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,299
No idea.

184
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,091
She does know how he left.

185
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:38,730
Aye.

186
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,827
Good.

187
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,974
How'd she react?

188
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,460
She was laughing.

189
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,578
Howling. Doubling up.

190
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,288
Now she's suckin' diesel!

191
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,808
We're safe now.

192
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:55,478
Safe from?

193
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:58,234
Don't even ask about it...

194
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,109
It's sick!

195
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,718
It's sick enough I had to kick him out!

196
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,479
Alright...

197
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,829
Venture a guess...

198
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:12,859
When Munshi Alam said his important thing...

199
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,609
D'you remember it?

200
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,189
I do.

201
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,939
What'd he say?

202
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,188
He said, 'Ask him'

203
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:22,868
'Who'd you marry if not Jiya'?

204
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:25,654
Why don't you tell me the answer to that?

205
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,718
I mean -- He won't actually marry her --

206
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:32,137
But who d'you think he'd name?

207
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,859
How'd I know?

208
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:36,676
I do, Suraiyya Begum.

209
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,562
The blighter's mind may be English,

210
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,863
But I can read it in Urdu.

211
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,448
I've reached 73 raising kids like him...

212
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,380
Who'd he name?

213
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,884
You sitting or standing?

214
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:56,824
Standing, Ammi Begum.

215
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,056
Take a seat.

216
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,447
Okay?

217
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,478
Don't tell anyone.

218
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,476
I won't!

219
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,859
Your dearest

220
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,688
Maheen, of course!

221
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,491
Didn't I just say sorry?

222
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,012
Please, forgive me this one time?

223
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,360
Gulrez!

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,260
Don't think I mean it when I say sorry.

225
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,759
Everything's fair in love and war.

226
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,407
But what happens in love

227
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:49,220
Happens not in war, Neelam.

228
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,070
Gotta say, though.

229
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,571
I've got her to hear it!

230
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,691
What you could never say!

231
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:57,161
It's okay.

232
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:58,649
I'm starving.

233
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,300
I'd like to have dinner.

234
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,441
Neelam was here today.

235
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,310
She asked me

236
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:12,881
If I ever

237
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,902
Went to buy a book

238
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:17,333
And bought perfume instead.

239
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,710
I said,

240
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,969
Aye.

241
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:23,509
She said, 'Don't get the perfume this time'.

242
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,399
'Get the book'.

243
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,010
'Just for once'...

244
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,971
'Go through one of its pages'...

245
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,140
'If you think it isn't worth it',

246
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,458
'Get all the perfume you want'.

247
00:15:35,538 --> 00:15:37,229
I know

248
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:38,978
Books

249
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:41,037
Don't have that sweet scent...

250
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,329
But...

251
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,581
A good read

252
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:47,900
Is redolent

253
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,692
With sweet words...

254
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,881
Which is why, this time,

255
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,910
I feel I ought to get the book

256
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,131
Instead of the perfume!

257
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,284
But whenever I think about it...

258
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:06,418
Why do <i>you</i> show up in the way?

259
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,578
Step aside!

260
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,569
Out of my way!

261
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,698
Go back where you came from!

262
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,699
Dinner, Neelam!

263
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,759
I'm honestly knackered.

264
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,319
Lovely.

265
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,999
She's thinking. You're waiting.

266
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:50,431
Wonder how you would doze off.

267
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,458
That's the limit...

268
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:54,118
Know what, Neelam...

269
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,947
When she left your birthday party,

270
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:02,497
It hurt me so much.

271
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:04,968
Whether or not she's thinking...

272
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,869
Whether she asks for time... Or gives us some...

273
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,619
I can doze off now...

274
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,676
Quite peacefully, actually...

275
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,676
My heart says

276
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:18,811
You're about to get your answer.

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,028
I've got a feeling she won't take time. Or refuse.

278
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,008
Dinner?

279
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:31,928
Don't believe me?

280
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,548
That's what I like about her.

281
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,059
She kills...

282
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,038
But never gives anyone false hope.

283
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,058
No idea what you're made of...

284
00:17:49,118 --> 00:17:52,678
You're so hopeful since you met her...

285
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,158
Good, though...

286
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,008
She's changing...

287
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,858
Dinner?

288
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,097
Know what, Dado's got a big problem...

289
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,937
She thinks of something

290
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:03,377
And wants it followed like a commandment.

291
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,368
She asked me, I said no,

292
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,338
But she still called you!

293
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,156
Why'd you say no?

294
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,457
Tell me...

295
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:15,149
Why'd <i>you</i> say yes?

296
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:17,290
Know what Fajr told her after you left?

297
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,683
What?

298
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,750
She said

299
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,997
You love me.

300
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,619
Like she's wrong.

301
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,138
Or maybe that's what you think.

302
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:30,920
Or maybe... You don't even deserve to be loved.

303
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,458
Jiya...

304
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,288
I'm not fit for love.

305
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:38,129
Good.

306
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:39,588
Good answer.

307
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:42,390
I brought you here to tell you

308
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,711
That whatever Dado said

309
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,003
Was not my decision.

310
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,508
Oh!

311
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,059
So you've come crawling back!

312
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,652
Ammi Begum came...

313
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,333
You crawled back!

314
00:19:54,523 --> 00:19:56,954
What's your problem, Waqar Ahmed?

315
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,636
It's not like I'm dying for you.

316
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:02,600
It's just that Ammi Begum called with a proposal...

317
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,720
I thought I've got to get married.

318
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,790
I know you.

319
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,231
We're friends.

320
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:09,391
Ain't too bad after all.

321
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,040
But you said you don't want to.

322
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,571
I don't want either! I don't care!

323
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,809
Got your wallet?

324
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:17,930
Eh?

325
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,061
Aye.

326
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,215
Good.

327
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:22,287
Don't forget to pay the bill.

328
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,258
Tell me, Ammi Begum.

329
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,878
What's he gonna say with his head in your lap?

330
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,943
Suraiyya knows what he's gonna say.

331
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,148
No...

332
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,858
I haven't the foggiest.

333
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:53,414
God knows what he'd say...

334
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,328
What does it mean to surrender completely?

335
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,388
He surrendered?

336
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,128
'Course, my dear...

337
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,058
Those who concede

338
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:14,657
Have to accept all the conditions of the victor.

339
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,458
Who's the victor?

340
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,785
Absolutely spiffing, Mehru.

341
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,812
If he surrendered to me,

342
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,970
Who d'you think is the victor but me?

343
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,909
He loves someone else.

344
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,819
That's what I think.

345
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:54,329
What can't happen in ten years?

346
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,440
I dare him.

347
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,708
What are you gonna do?

348
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:10,368
I said we're having roasted aubergine. So we will. Willy-nilly.

349
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,007
Don't try to get anything else on the stove.

350
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,548
I don't get it, Ammi Begum.

351
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,188
I do.

352
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,979
What'd you get?

353
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:30,610
He doesn't like roasted aubergine.

354
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,777
What are you gonna tell Jiya?

355
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,248
I've given her my word.

356
00:22:48,288 --> 00:22:50,964
Made a promise too.

357
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,131
I'm gonna honour it.

358
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,248
Did you call her father?

359
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,178
What do I tell him?

360
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,297
Let me sort things out here first.

361
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,007
The blighter may not have won,

362
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,958
But he hasn't quite surrendered yet.

363
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,390
Jiya's very nice.

364
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,951
Lovely too.

365
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:21,022
No idea what Waqar's looking for.

366
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:24,580
Just pray he doesn't do something crooked!

367
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,879
Rascals like himself would nag you to get them the moon to play with one day.

368
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,558
I'll have to talk to Jiya...

369
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,718
Assure her...

370
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,808
Or she'd think the old lady went back on her word...

371
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,900
Hi!

372
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,048
Hi.

373
00:24:13,498 --> 00:24:15,329
'Sup? Here to pull me up again?

374
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,720
No, partner!

375
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,431
Just here to tell you you've succeeded!

376
00:24:22,151 --> 00:24:23,621
Don't get it?

377
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,941
Smell something?

378
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,809
Where?

379
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,281
I'm wearing your perfume, mate!

380
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:33,982
Thank you so much!

381
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,618
Truce?

382
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,908
Could you do something for me?
-Yeah?

383
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:43,938
Marry Jiya.

384
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,858
I'm just friends with Jiya.

385
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:47,369
That's <i>precisely</i> why, Sherlock!

386
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:51,149
It takes a while to make friends with your wife. She's already your friend!

387
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:52,955
Could you possibly hope for better?

388
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,285
You here to say that?

389
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,046
No.

390
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:56,557
One more thing...

391
00:24:56,937 --> 00:25:00,808
If you make a place for yourself in someone's heart, learn to stay there.

392
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,670
You don't learn it that easy in London,

393
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,540
But girls' hearts are not leaseholds

394
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,530
That you can leave

395
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,240
At your leisure.

396
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,668
See you!

397
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,237
And aye,

398
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,528
We're friends!

399
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,148
You twit... When we've talked to you,

400
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,998
When we said he's gonna marry you,

401
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:40,629
Why d'you need to listen to his cock and bull stories?

402
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:43,949
Ammi Begum's given you her word.

403
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:46,959
Come over anytime you want.

404
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,840
See him. See us all you want.

405
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,740
If you stay before his eyes,

406
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:57,302
You'll begin to make your place in them.

407
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,222
By the way,

408
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:03,493
Do you know how to play cricket?

409
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,957
No, Ammi Begum...

410
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,700
Why don't you learn it, love?

411
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:12,951
Call me coach! I'll train you!

412
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:15,172
Why'd I want to learn to play cricket?

413
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,911
You don't know...

414
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:21,743
But he absolutely loves cricket.

415
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,428
He loves to play with the ladies!

416
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,018
Learn to play, wager everything, and win him over!

417
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,100
I say he's all yours.

418
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,968
No, Ammi Begum.

419
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,327
He's not.

420
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,868
And to be honest, I don't want him either.

421
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:49,038
What are you saying?

422
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,468
You were so delighted to hear the proposal the other day!

423
00:26:54,827 --> 00:26:57,618
I liked how you proposed to me.

424
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:58,968
Just a minute...

425
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,092
Just a minute...

426
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,544
Gimme the phone...

427
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:03,254
C'mon!

428
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:05,564
Lemme talk to her.

429
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,150
Hello?

430
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,179
Hi, matey.

431
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:10,519
How are you?

432
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
Don't even ask.

433
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,910
Why'd you refuse?

434
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,400
How 'bout you tell me

435
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,210
Why d'you want to force Waqar on me?

436
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,371
Can't you find someone else for him?

437
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,792
You saw him?

438
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:22,852
I mean...

439
00:27:22,852 --> 00:27:24,793
One of these days?

440
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,399
What good is it?

441
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,475
Is it something he said?

442
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:31,045
He isn't fit to be loved, mate!

443
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,007
I can't even think of a man so unfit!

444
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,698
Please find someone else for him.

445
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,390
You're hiding something, aren't you?

446
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,262
I swear, I'm not.

447
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,891
I mean it.

448
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:48,692
He doesn't suit me.

449
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,040
He's nice. Sweet.

450
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,947
But <i>just</i> sweet and nice doesn't do it for me.

451
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,844
I'll talk to you later.

452
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,415
Please tell Ammi Begum I'm sorry again.

453
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,752
What'd she say?

454
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,112
She said sorry.

455
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,030
If you make a place for yourself in someone's heart, learn to stay there.

456
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:05,985
You don't learn it that easy in London,

457
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,715
But girls' hearts are not leaseholds

458
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:08,795
That you can leave

459
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,546
At your leisure.

460
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,048
Hello?

461
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:40,898
Hi.

462
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:43,109
I hope you were not sleeping.

463
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:45,308
I was just about to sleep.

464
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,239
Go on.

465
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,270
I'm awake.

466
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,459
Good.

467
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:50,869
Jiya, let's... Discuss the proposal?

468
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,399
What proposal?

469
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,108
Dado's proposal?

470
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,430
That chapter's closed.

471
00:29:56,709 --> 00:30:01,099
I've told Ammi Begum you're unfit to be loved.

472
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:03,974
You're angry.

473
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,778
Of course not.

474
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,500
Why'd I be?

475
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,059
You thought you couldn't love me.

476
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,410
I thought, too,

477
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,590
I couldn't possibly love <i>you</i>!

478
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,400
Just a sec.

479
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,901
Can we forget yesterday's convo for a moment?

480
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,171
Why?

481
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:19,931
Maheen said

482
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,958
I ought to marry you.

483
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,828
Maheen?

484
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,068
Aye.

485
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,648
At least she gave me something to think about.

486
00:30:28,648 --> 00:30:30,479
And I think she was right.

487
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,069
Talk to you tomorrow?

488
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,289
Why tomorrow?

489
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,778
I'm knackered.

490
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:36,218
Good night.

491
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,358
Look at me.

492
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,228
We need to talk.

493
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,819
You made peace with Waqar?

494
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,858
Know why?

495
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,088
You'd be in sin if I didn't.

496
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,809
You shook hands with him too?

497
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,790
Of course.

498
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,088
We made peace. Became friends. It's but natural!

499
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,797
Stay tuned

500
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,788
For what he's gonna do.

501
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:40,780
What?

502
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,348
Don't ask me.

503
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,388
Tell me...

504
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:46,569
What'd you tell Neelam?

505
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,789
Ask me about what Neelam asked me!

506
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,849
I know what she'd ask you.

507
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,980
Tell me what <i>you</i> said.

508
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,229
I asked her to read my diary.

509
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:02,409
She'd find all her answers in it.

510
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:05,570
What's in your diary?

511
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,368
I've written that I want to fall in love with Gulrez.

512
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:14,738
I'll marry him the moment I do.

513
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:16,369
Get married.

514
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,769
Fall in love when you want.

515
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,578
You can't be serious!

516
00:32:20,578 --> 00:32:21,628
Just --

517
00:32:21,628 --> 00:32:23,068
Say it plainly.

518
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:24,739
You kicked her out!

519
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,920
You asked for time. Now you're showing her your diary. What else are you gonna show us?

520
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,599
You're in the mood for a fight, Mum!

521
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,683
Not with you!

522
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:35,008
I'm fighting myself.

523
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,998
You don't seem to budge.

524
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,708
And Ammi Begum

525
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:42,469
Says all sorts of things...

526
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,368
The sort that'd give you sleepless nights!

527
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,950
That why you're up?

528
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,939
Forget about sleeping.

529
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:51,413
Just tell me plainly...

530
00:32:51,453 --> 00:32:53,693
How much more time do you want?

531
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,019
Just decide in one go

532
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,330
And tell me exactly

533
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,090
How many days, months, or years you want!

534
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,261
Gotta say, that's some fine Queen's English!

535
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:08,521
Just answer my question!

536
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:10,747
Well...

537
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:12,461
Not more than...

538
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:14,095
A couple of days?

539
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,838
Take a couple of years if you want,

540
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:18,868
For all I care!

541
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:21,660
But don't you dare refuse, Maheen!

542
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,817
Or there will be blood!

543
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,868
Okay...

544
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,559
Back to your diary.

545
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,228
I'll ask you in a few days.

546
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,768
Dado says girls are like birds.

547
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:48,070
Playful...

548
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,130
Gourmands...

549
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,108
Who'd fly away in a flash!

550
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,590
I ain't that silly, you know.

551
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,698
But this is something I don't quite get.

552
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:59,729
I'm pretty sure you don't get it either.

553
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,990
You live in London.

554
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,969
I hear it's a proper nightmare to find a girl there.

555
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,190
There's millions of English roses there.

556
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:12,829
Who says you need to look for one?

557
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:14,030
Dado.

558
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:16,535
She says you only find chits there.

559
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:19,370
Maybe one or two ladies among the lot... But that's about it.

560
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,108
Well, then, ask her

561
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,808
How she defines a lady.

562
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,620
I've asked her.

563
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,701
She said, 'A lady keeps her dreams locked safely within her heart',

564
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,450
'And lets unfulfilled dreams'

565
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,278
'Flow away with the dripping oceans of her eyes'...

566
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,551
But why are you telling me any of this?

567
00:35:45,551 --> 00:35:48,798
You're (in)famous for making friends with girls.

568
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:51,842
Dado says boys and girls ain't never just friends.

569
00:35:51,842 --> 00:35:55,283
And it ain't proper to marry your friend.

570
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,987
Proper?

571
00:35:57,077 --> 00:35:58,361
That's weird.

572
00:35:58,361 --> 00:36:00,692
It's not, Waqar. I mean, look at it this way...

573
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,890
You can be friends with many girls.

574
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,510
Aye?

575
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,871
As you can be with many boys.

576
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,421
So...

577
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:09,971
Is it proper?

578
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,501
Aunt?

579
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,958
Here alone on Sunday?

580
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,619
Hey...

581
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,191
I know why girls are like birds.

582
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,947
Cage them,

583
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,477
Send them from one branch to another,

584
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:45,289
Or one country to another...

585
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,037
They'd accept their fate

586
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:55,900
Quietly.

587
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
