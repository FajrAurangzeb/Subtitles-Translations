1
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,768
Hello!

2
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,327
Who is it?

3
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,974
I thought you'd recognise my voice.

4
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:21,227
Your voice

5
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,988
Sounds familiar.

6
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:27,679
You sound like my dirty rotten cousin.

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,719
Who are you?

8
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:32,900
Your dirty rotten cousin.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,209
Hey!

10
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:37,059
How dare you call me?

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,500
Heard you cried that day. After the slap...

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,719
So?

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,240
I feel guilty.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,330
So?

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,014
Are you seriously 'so'-ing my sympathy?

16
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,885
Listen, Waqar Ahmed,

17
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,256
Don't you dare call me again. Like, ever.

18
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,335
You're not allowed. Get it?

19
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:56,093
Alright, but I've got one last thing to say to you...

20
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:57,655
Go on.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,305
I hate you.

22
00:00:59,995 --> 00:01:02,635
I HATE YOU TOOOOOO!!!

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,368
You blighter!

24
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,909
Six.

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,749
Again!

26
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,869
Everyone remembers the slap...

27
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,789
Including Dado!

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,069
But no one bothers to ask what she was gonna do.

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,311
She nicked the Colonel's puppy.

30
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:07,970
Big deal. It was so cute. We couldn't find another one like it.

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,818
C'mon, Fajr... We would've been in the nick for the next six months!

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,880
Why me? I was just a kid!

33
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:15,990
See?

34
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,159
What?

35
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,900
I leave home for a few days and you turn into pirates proper.

36
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,568
Easy, Waqar.

37
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:24,853
Dado and Uncle Dastoor are members too.

38
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,478
Dado doesn't even know

39
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,929
She stole the Colonel's puppy.

40
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:31,689
Aye, she'd only care about the slap...

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,841
Anyway... I slapped her... Big deal!

42
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,769
Does she have to be furious about it all her life?

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,349
I've been here four days.

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,640
She never even said hello.

45
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:45,900
She won't.

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,438
Like I care.

47
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:51,281
I just said because... It doesn't look proper.

48
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,039
I'd rather keep it between us.

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,410
If she keeps at it, I'll finish her off where she won't have an ounce of relief!

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,809
Whoa...

51
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,219
Whoa what?

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,091
Goodness knows who she thinks she is... Her type are the maids in London!

53
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,820
Want me to tell her that?

54
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,861
Be my guest. Like I fear her.

55
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,589
You don't really have to though...

56
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,999
I just said it in a fit of rage...

57
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,351
By the way...

58
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,367
How much

59
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,810
Does the Gang have right now?

60
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,893
Hmm...

61
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:31,303
Not more than 2 grand.

62
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,609
2 grand in four years!

63
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:35,968
Wow...

64
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:39,439
Remember you had 90 grand when I left?

65
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,660
She ain't a good planner...

66
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,630
Not about money, at least. We almost got 50 gee from Dad,

67
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,778
But she opened the letter again just five minutes before, and started crying...

68
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:51,790
'I can't blackmail anyone in the name of love' and stuff...

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,020
What letter?
-Dad had a friend...

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,699
His classmate. She once wrote... 'Sorry, Dastoor, but I can't marry you'.

71
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,950
Followed by her entire story!

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,181
Ooh...

73
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:06,252
She also returned the 25 gee we got for the Foxy.

74
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:09,452
We'd worked so hard to get our hands on it.

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,658
Why? Had pity on Gulrez?

76
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:14,878
No. She got furious.

77
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,622
Over the engagement.

78
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:19,420
She virtually took the laddoo [sweet] from my mouth!

79
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:21,037
Gotta say...

80
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,852
Maheen ain't marrying Gulrez.

81
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,370
She will.

82
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,870
What it is is she loves to toy with her food before she eats it!

83
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,054
She'll have him sell the Foxy!

84
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,720
Blimey, mate...

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,269
He loves her!

86
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:41,270
She knows it too...

87
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,951
But she <i>hates</i> his Foxy.

88
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,030
Hmm...

89
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,641
'Hmm' what?

90
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,351
'Hmm', as in...

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,470
I could wreck her ego in minutes... But it seems you folks

92
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,751
Haven't got the guts.

93
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:58,022
How?

94
00:04:58,102 --> 00:04:59,659
Very simple.

95
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,671
Gang meeting.

96
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:03,644
This evening.

97
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,408
Let's oust her from the Chiefship.

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,108
Honestly... D'you think the badmin deserves such an important position?

99
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,096
She doesn't, but she's been running the Gang on her pocket money for four years.

100
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,780
If she got wind of it, you can bet anything

101
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,848
She won't even say hello to you for a hundred years!

102
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,398
Curse her hello.

103
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:34,898
But -- I wasn't conspiring for real. I just wanted to check...

104
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,728
If you've got even an ounce of loyalty in you.

105
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,298
And truly speaking,

106
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,691
I'm impressed.

107
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,063
Like, wow...

108
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,195
Go on.

109
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,918
Please, go on with your game.

110
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,438
Jiya!

111
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,728
Ahoy, matey!

112
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,269
When'd you get here?

113
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,670
(Lemme greet Aunt!)

114
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,748
Peace be 'pon you!

115
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:20,944
And upon you! Bless you! Long live!

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,380
Where's the wee lassie?

117
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,069
Wee lassie ain't so wee now. She's at her Nano's.

118
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,570
My cousin's here.

119
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,520
(The blighter!)

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,840
(Who slapped me!)

121
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,940
(You still remember?)

122
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
(I always will.)

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,621
Come!

124
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:34,017
Uncle Qutb!

125
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,491
Uncle Qutb!

126
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,322
We'd like a cuppa!

127
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,159
Come!

128
00:07:42,938 --> 00:07:45,298
So... When'd you get back from London?

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,698
Four days back.

130
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,631
Hey!

131
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,018
The blighter got back four days back too!

132
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:53,532
He was on the plane with me. Right by me, in fact!

133
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,798
Gorblimey, matey... Do I sense something goin' on?

134
00:07:57,798 --> 00:07:59,009
No way...

135
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,399
We're friends. That's all.

136
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,568
<i>Just</i> friends.

137
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:05,398
I found out he's your cousin when I got here,

138
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:08,779
And now that he's the one who slapped you.

139
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,779
Exchanged numbers yet?

140
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:14,010
Of course.

141
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,912
Big deal.

142
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:21,281
It becomes one in a while, matey...

143
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,111
Oh, please...

144
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,702
I am not that cheap.

145
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,620
I thought

146
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,680
He's here to get engaged to you or something.

147
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,795
Me?

148
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:32,477
Aye.

149
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,638
C'mon, mate...

150
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,829
I'm also not that cheap!

151
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,810
Looking at the lawn, it looks like you folks stopped playing cricket after I left.

152
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,081
After Dado's knee got hurt, actually.

153
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,866
She jumped on the crease last Sunday.

154
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,661
What?

155
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,548
Unfortunately, she lost both the score and her knee.

156
00:08:57,614 --> 00:09:00,054
But she's fine now.

157
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,000
We're looking at a match after lunch.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,131
An India vs Pakistan match, no less!

159
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:07,021
Oh?

160
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,801
You think any of you folks can beat me?

161
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,700
Beat you? She'll blow you out of the water.

162
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,781
Water?

163
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:15,542
She's playing with fire, you know.

164
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:20,792
Oh, she's gonna set the stage on fire. Her fours and sixes burn the bowlers to ashes!

165
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:24,603
Oh, please. My bouncer will knock her for six.

166
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:25,440
Ha ha ha...

167
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,120
What's with the 'Ha ha'? Don't believe me?

168
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,751
'Ha ha', because <i>you</i> don't believe it!

169
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:32,851
Bowl a bouncer and she says, 'Lovely shot, mate'!

170
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,194
Ooh...

171
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,883
You can ask Gulrez if you want.

172
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,338
Gulrez?

173
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:43,135
Who does he play for these days?

174
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,871
Gulrez...

175
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,168
Plays for Maheen.

176
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,027
Amazing...

177
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,589
They don't get along.

178
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:55,165
Don't understand each other.

179
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,719
But they play together.

180
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,238
Very nice.

181
00:09:58,294 --> 00:09:59,772
Very funny.

182
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:01,718
Aye, it is.

183
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,608
Gulrez!

184
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,848
Gulrez!

185
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,518
Uncle Dastoor!

186
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,994
Where's Gulrez?

187
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,245
Everything alright?

188
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,156
Gee, mate, I'm just asking where Gulrez is.

189
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:40,335
What happened?

190
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,760
Everything alright?

191
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,155
Of course.

192
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:45,546
Ask him to come see me.

193
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:46,686
No...

194
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:49,387
Tell me... What'd Maheen say?

195
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,407
Blimey...

196
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:52,568
Where does she come in?

197
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,843
Come. I've got something to show you.

198
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,799
C'mon already.

199
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,118
Quickly!

200
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:03,919
You gotta see this!

201
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,148
Here.

202
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,938
Would you look at that?

203
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,691
I got this for Gulrez.

204
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,430
Wow...

205
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,488
Whoa!

206
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:22,619
What a lovely new car!

207
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,984
Whose is it?

208
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:28,662
Gulrez's.

209
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,978
I thought it's about time things changed...

210
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:33,498
Get the bugger here.

211
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,054
Just a sec!

212
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,012
You didn't tell him?

213
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,308
No.

214
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,860
I thought I'd surprise him.

215
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,093
Pray, too...

216
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,430
For?

217
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,731
Simple, Uncle...

218
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,258
Pray <i>he</i> doesn't surprise <i>you</i>.

219
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,490
I mean, look here...

220
00:11:55,552 --> 00:12:00,049
He's been busy with a cheapjack mechanic, trying to get this fixed, until...

221
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,989
He got tired and dozed off inside her.

222
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,869
I'll get going.

223
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
Got a car to return now, I guess...

224
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,740
I don't know how many hearts I've broken when I left the engagement,

225
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,521
Or the extent to which Gulrez was guilty of hatching that plot,

226
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,773
But I do know he's guilty.

227
00:13:05,848 --> 00:13:07,618
I mean, he may be nice,

228
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:10,120
He may love me, as they all say,

229
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,170
But why does no one seem to care that I don't love him at all?

230
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,248
It was Nano.

231
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,268
Match over at her place.

232
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:27,708
I made it clear. I ain't playin' if that blighter is.

233
00:13:27,814 --> 00:13:29,500
You're not going?

234
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,039
No way, mate.

235
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,408
I got to.

236
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,218
I heard him say, 'Don't call her, Dado'!

237
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:37,520
'Or my bouncer's gonna break her face'!

238
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,658
Blimey...

239
00:13:38,697 --> 00:13:40,548
You'd play bouncers?

240
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,440
You haven't seen me play. It's going up and away!

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,859
The blighter will be knocked for six.

242
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,888
Blimey, someone's real furious.

243
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:52,043
I despise him!

244
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,653
I mean -- Look here!

245
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:55,120
He slapped me right here!

246
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,673
They all saw the scar for five days!

247
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:59,512
And -- Not to mention the pain!

248
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,959
Jaysus...

249
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,598
I've sworn

250
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:04,754
To get even.

251
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:06,454
How?

252
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:08,655
No idea.

253
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,389
But I'm sure

254
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,340
That one day

255
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,968
I'll get my chance.

256
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:17,729
Why don't you marry him?

257
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,184
What?

258
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,910
Easiest way to get your opportunity, darling. Become his wife!

259
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,240
I want to punish him...

260
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,120
Not myself, matey!

261
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,150
Okay... I'll get going. Enjoy the match!

262
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,258
Wait!

263
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,409
Not so fast.

264
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,430
The match is after lunch.

265
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
So...

266
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,001
Still singling or mingling?

267
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:45,381
Still looking...

268
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:47,155
Won't be for long...

269
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:48,752
You? Looking?

270
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,764
Don't kid me, matey.

271
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,978
Find someone who's looking for you.

272
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,049
Hmm!

273
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,908
Uncle Dastoor was here.

274
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:21,780
Hey!

275
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,758
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,680
You were sleeping. Inside your Foxy.

277
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:33,951
He'd got you a new car, but, seeing you in her arms, he thought he'd rather leave.

278
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,963
Good.

279
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,993
What'd I do with a new car?

280
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:41,907
Aye, but the rest of us all think

281
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:48,614
That you'd change someday, a miracle would happen someday, and you'll change for someone...

282
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,069
Someone?

283
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,651
I mean...

284
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,968
You got to marry someone someday, yes?

285
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,679
Maheen refused?

286
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,469
Maheen won't refuse.

287
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,967
What if Uncle Dastoor told her this thing about the Foxy?

288
00:16:06,347 --> 00:16:10,567
Care to tell me if you love Maheen or fear her?

289
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,179
I don't fear anyone.

290
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,059
Oh, please.

291
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,099
You go white at the thought of her refusing.

292
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:19,264
But you just said she won't!

293
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:21,305
That's where you're wrong, silly.

294
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:23,525
You trust others

295
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:25,884
To know what's in her heart.

296
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,150
Get out of these... Apprehensions...

297
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,072
Gather your courage. She's your Aunt's girl.

298
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:37,823
Just face her and ask her why she left without a word the moment they brought up the engagement! It's perfectly okay!

299
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,878
You want me to ask her that?

300
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,768
No.

301
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:44,969
Who d'you want to ask that? Me?

302
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,294
Wali?

303
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,868
Uncle Dastoor or Ammi Begum?

304
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,528
Know what,

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,041
You're the type who love without quite understanding it.

306
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,670
Love is a force that seizes your heart.

307
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,761
A force that awes. A force that reigns.

308
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,018
Seize her heart.

309
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:13,358
As long as you're in her heart,

310
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:18,589
Distances won't matter. No one else would be able to conquer her.

311
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:19,770
Hmm!

312
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,451
Well said!

313
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,898
Maheen!

314
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:07,848
Maheen!

315
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,099
Hey! Maheen?

316
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,500
Dado!

317
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,568
Maheen!

318
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,608
Maheen!

319
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,049
Maheen?

320
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,998
Water!

321
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:26,329
Maheen!

322
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,079
S -- She'll be fine, Dado...

323
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,279
Maheen!

324
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,839
Get some water!

325
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,030
Maheen?

326
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,188
Dado -- She --

327
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,971
Hello?

328
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,268
What?

329
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,800
Ma'am?

330
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,910
Get the car. Maheen's had an accident!

331
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,311
With a car?

332
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:04,441
No, with Waqar! Get the car out, I'm coming in a second!

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,559
Of all the people he could bump into...

334
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:12,339
A slap four years back,

335
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,919
And now this crash.

336
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,089
The blighter.

337
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:18,449
He didn't do it on purpose.

338
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,073
He was just trying to catch the ball.

339
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,970
Oh, please... It wasn't the India vs Pakistan match or something...

340
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,438
So you'd rather we lose the match!

341
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,869
As if we've won!

342
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:34,309
We still missed the catch.

343
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,358
Because <i>someone</i> had to drop in at the wrongest moment!

344
00:21:39,438 --> 00:21:41,188
For siding with him,

345
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:42,878
I'll kill you, Fajr!

346
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,592
The blighter did it on purpose!

347
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,770
Perhaps...

348
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:53,260
What are you saying, Nano?

349
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,300
I mean... Look at how...

350
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,508
Shameless he is!

351
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:00,129
He didn't even come to check on her.

352
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:01,885
I dare him!

353
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:04,115
I'd break his face!

354
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,558
Whoa...

355
00:22:05,595 --> 00:22:07,933
His arm broke.

356
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,468
And now you'd break his face...

357
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,969
What?

358
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,428
His arm -- What?

359
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:19,739
I swear...

360
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,098
He's been hurt bad.

361
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:25,098
He ran to the doctor in pain.

362
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:26,968
His arm broke?

363
00:22:26,968 --> 00:22:29,968
Good Lord... What happened to my little girl?

364
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:32,488
Hold your horses, Suraiyya.

365
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:34,958
Not her arm.

366
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,431
Then?

367
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:38,099
Who?

368
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,289
We're talking about Waqar.

369
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:43,535
It kills me!

370
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:44,990
Where's he?

371
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,062
He's gone to the doctor.

372
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,773
Everyone here was concerned about Maheen,

373
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:52,904
Leaving him to help himself.

374
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,748
He took the car and left.

375
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,368
Better?

376
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:14,242
Yeah, better now.

377
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,244
Wonder why you're doing any of this...

378
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:19,088
No questions, you bugger... Back to work!

379
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:20,918
I've got so many patients!

380
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:22,839
Ain't I one of them?

381
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,948
Ain't I?

382
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,013
Thank you.

383
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,501
Okay, what about my arm X-ray?

384
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:33,042
How d'you think I could possibly get you one?

385
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,028
You'll get it, sir.

386
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:37,861
How?

387
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,219
The lady who had an accident and died...

388
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,878
We've still got her arm X-ray.

389
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,388
What?

390
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:46,942
You off your head?

391
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,392
You'd give him her X-ray?

392
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:50,476
You serious? Her arm was pulverised!

393
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,147
Nah, it's okay. Gimme that one.

394
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:55,867
Don't worry, give me hers.

395
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,068
Thank you so much!

396
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,250
Who d'you want to impress with that?

397
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,660
I ain't impressin' anyone, boyo!

398
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,060
I want to one-up someone.

399
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,861
Who?

400
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,519
A witch.

401
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,256
Done?

402
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,579
Go.

403
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,938
Okay.

404
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:26,880
See you when I'm better. We'll party hard.

405
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,358
You've never been better!

406
00:24:29,688 --> 00:24:31,669
That... Stays between us.

407
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,837
Dado thinks I've broken my arm.

408
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:35,898
I only care about her.

409
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:37,519
I can handle everyone else.

410
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,310
Don't forget your sling!

411
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:41,631
Ow...

412
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,668
Bye!

413
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,619
Next patient, please!

414
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,609
What...

415
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:02,438
What happened?

416
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:03,958
Got hurt.

417
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:06,448
Could you get the X-ray from the side seat?

418
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,349
Quickly... C'mon!

419
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,398
Ah!

420
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,772
Broken?

421
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:31,219
Good Lord...

422
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,830
Who cursed him?

423
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,031
I'm fine, Aunt! Just a scratch...

424
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:36,560
With that sling...

425
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,361
It doesn't look much like a scratch!

426
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,610
And -- You cried out the moment Ammi Begum hugged you...

427
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:47,441
Broke my arm...

428
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,942
But don't worry... Just a fracture, Aunt...

429
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,519
Broke your arm?

430
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,169
It's okay, Dado...

431
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,031
It'll heal.

432
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:58,049
Tell me... How's she?

433
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,902
Blimey... He's asking about her without a care about his own arm...

434
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,110
How's she, Aunt? I asked something!

435
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,139
She's fine!

436
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,178
She just -- Creates a scene.

437
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:13,488
Just a little bump on her head... That's all... She's fine now!

438
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,308
It's all -- Because of me...

439
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,339
No way... You aren't responsible for any of it...

440
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,481
It was destined to happen...

441
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:25,691
Who, including you, could know

442
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:30,181
She'd drop in right when you were about to catch the ball?

443
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,718
C'mon.

444
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,073
Come with me.

445
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,140
I'll take you to your room.

446
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,571
It's okay, Aunt. I can go on my own.

447
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,777
Just take care of her...

448
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,809
Or she'll think...

449
00:26:43,861 --> 00:26:46,501
This was chapter 2 of the slap.

450
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:47,892
Aunt...

451
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,909
It's not my fault, but...

452
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,359
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,459
Hey!

454
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:55,268
How's it your fault?

455
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,483
You just bumped into her.

456
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,408
Go.

457
00:27:01,488 --> 00:27:03,469
Get some rest. You need it.

458
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,331
Aye...

459
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,008
Really need it...

460
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,868
Go with him, you twits! What are you waiting for?

461
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,518
His X-ray.

462
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,529
Call her.

463
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,028
What happened?

464
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,099
Can anyone tell me what you see?

465
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:57,810
His bone's pulverised, Mum!

466
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,714
What?

467
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:00,575
Good Heavens.

468
00:28:02,115 --> 00:28:03,845
Pulverised? Where?

469
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,713
Right here, Aunt!

470
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:07,762
Look at his elbow...

471
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,999
Where?

472
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:14,200
Aye, where... It's been utterly destroyed...

473
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,670
It kills me...

474
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,670
His right elbow... Blimey...

475
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,528
But how can that be?

476
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,469
I mean -- He was on his feet alright!

477
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,370
He's a man.

478
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,851
He can take a broken elbow.

479
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,821
But...

480
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,899
How'd you know

481
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:38,725
If he was on his feet or fell down?

482
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:43,880
You were unconscious until we sprinkled some water on you.

483
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,508
Effin' ice cube.

484
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,854
Eh?

485
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,058
He's an effin' ice cube, Mum!

486
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:54,498
I thought I'd be out cold forever!

487
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,188
Look

488
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,048
Who we were so worried about.

489
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:02,169
We didn't even think about what happened to him.

490
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,536
He's fine!

491
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,080
He's just putting up an act!

492
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,589
By the Lord, Maheen...

493
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:11,022
Didn't you hear him cry in pain

494
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:13,712
The moment Ammi Begum hugged him?

495
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,840
And -- D'you think it's all a lie?

496
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,838
This X-ray and all?

497
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,118
How'd he get hurt that bad?

498
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:23,369
One bump into me broke his arm?

499
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:26,840
Pulverised, more like? Something just seems <i>off</i>!

500
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,770
One bump into this ice cube, and she was out cold for five minutes!

501
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,819
You sound delighted.

502
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:40,349
Nah, I ain't exactly delighted... But it felt nice... Sorta.

503
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,209
Lemme tell her.

504
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:43,850
Not cricket, mate!

505
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,020
You're gonna ruin everything!

506
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:49,696
And... To be honest, I've got hurt too... Broke my arm.

507
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:50,964
What?

508
00:29:50,964 --> 00:29:55,275
You broke your arm and yet you're so lively and energetic?

509
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:58,446
Yeah, I broke it... Sorta... Got it bandaged and all.

510
00:29:58,476 --> 00:29:59,845
Swear by me.

511
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:02,036
Why? I hate this thing.

512
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:03,578
'Swear by me', 'swear by your head'...

513
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:06,679
No. I said I broke my arm. Why don't you just believe it?

514
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,780
Okay, I'm coming to see you.

515
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,961
But why?

516
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:16,421
Just wanna check on you... Get you some flowers... Maybe even a 'get well soon' card! The little stuff, you know...

517
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:19,485
No. The doctor wants me to rest. I need it badly. Bye.

518
00:30:19,537 --> 00:30:21,252
Why don't you come over...

519
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:22,913
For some ice cream?

520
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:23,879
Ice cream?

521
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:26,420
Aye. I know you love it.

522
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,660
Okay...

523
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:29,740
How 'bout tomorrow?

524
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,067
Pick your poison!

525
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,378
Come over, or I'm coming!

526
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:34,989
Okay, I'm coming.

527
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,219
Okay.

528
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,178
Okay, bye.

529
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,241
Why don't you say it already?

530
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,180
What is it that

531
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:55,159
You can't say before Suraiyya?

532
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,800
Bad news, but those greys don't quite reflect experience.

533
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,290
Ehh?

534
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,652
Says who?

535
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,053
Everyone can see it!

536
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,318
Care to tell me how?

537
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:12,058
As if you didn't see it.

538
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,611
I guess I did...

539
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:18,951
His right arm was away from Maheen!

540
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,608
Aye...

541
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:23,539
So?

542
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,900
So how'd the crash break his <i>right</i> arm?

543
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,533
Aye...

544
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,798
Touché...

545
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:33,518
But the bandage...

546
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:36,018
You mean it was all an act?

547
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:38,519
But...

548
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,364
I'm sure a doctor bandaged him?

549
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,447
Want his name?

550
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,860
Aye?

551
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,171
Dr Imran!

552
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:51,981
Waqar's old school-fellow!

553
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,001
Oh!

554
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,209
Call Imran.

555
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,368
I'll get my diary.

556
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,668
But why'd he do it?

557
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:14,158
To one-up Maheen!

558
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:15,978
You didn't notice

559
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:19,330
How much you were worried for her when she got hurt!

560
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,110
Everyone forgot her

561
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,800
The moment they heard about his broken arm.

562
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,726
Ahh...

563
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,728
Not to mention the pulverised bone...

564
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,050
So he was trying to outfox us!

565
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,550
Call him right now.

566
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:40,141
Right here!

567
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,229
Imran?

568
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:52,198
It's Waqar's Dado. Kaneez Begum.

569
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,580
Hey...

570
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,660
There's no one in here...

571
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,388
Where'd the lad go?

572
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,899
Go... Ask Munshi Alam to look for him.

573
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:52,350
Double time.

574
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,238
Now where'd he hole up?

575
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,969
Aunt Mehru, Aunt Suraiyya, Fajr, Ali...

576
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:10,799
They were all huddled 'round her like she were some goldmine or something.

577
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:14,819
I hear they were cursing me behind my back!

578
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,670
But this dit about my broken arm

579
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,898
Gave them all a proper fright!

580
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:21,959
And Dado

581
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,369
Turned white, I tell you!

582
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,709
I heard her pain when she said, 'Waqar'...

583
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,828
Everyone gathered around me. Worried.

584
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:33,018
They all forgot her in a sec.

585
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,418
Bet she's disapppointed.

586
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:37,018
The agony's gonna kill her before sunrise.

587
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:41,202
As if you'd be happy to see her like that.

588
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:42,599
Eh?

589
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,920
Nah, not really like that...

590
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,270
But -- I don't know, Jiya...

591
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,410
She gets my back up!

592
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,650
No idea what she thinks she is.

593
00:34:53,361 --> 00:34:55,230
Where'd you get hurt?

594
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,287
Me?

595
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,749
My elbow.

596
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:04,429
Show me.

597
00:35:04,698 --> 00:35:05,959
What?

598
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,969
You can't see it.

599
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,441
I was fibbing, mate.

600
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,198
I don't always lie. Except to her. Somehow.

601
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,878
I guess you

602
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,169
Carry a torch for her.

603
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,888
What?

604
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,438
Are you touched in the head?

605
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:34,278
She's the only one in the entire world I could never like one bit.

606
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,027
What about me?

607
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,248
You're a friend, Jiya. I like all my friends.

608
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,488
I've told you before.

609
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:51,809
I don't believe a boy and a girl can be just friends.

610
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:52,748
Hmm...

611
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:53,872
Why?

612
00:35:53,872 --> 00:35:55,465
What's wrong with it?

613
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:56,920
And -- What else are we?

614
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,847
Why do we talk for hours on the phone? Why do we see each other? And why -- This ice cream -- And all?

615
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:06,953
Who d'you think you are? Me Aunt's girl? A business partner?

616
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,820
Hmm! Wait, wait, wait!

617
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,360
At least finish your ice cream! Jiya!

618
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,890
I was just kidding, Jiya! Hey!

619
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
