1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd recognise my voice.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your voice

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sounds familiar.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sound like my dirty rotten cousin.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your dirty rotten cousin.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you call me?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard you cried that day. After the slap...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel guilty.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you seriously 'so'-ing my sympathy?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, Waqar Ahmed,

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare call me again.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not allowed. Get it?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, but I've got one last thing to say to you...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate you.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HATE YOU TOOOOOO!!!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blighter!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Six.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Again!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone remembers the slap...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Including Dado!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But no one bothers to ask what she was gonna do.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She nicked the Colonel's puppy.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal. It was so cute. We couldn't find another one like it.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Fajr... We would've been in the nick for the next six months!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why me? I was just a kid!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I leave home for a few days and you turn into pirates proper.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy, Waqar.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado and Uncle Dastoor are members too.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado doesn't even know

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She stole the Colonel's puppy.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, she'd only care about the slap...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I slapped her... Big deal!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does she have to be furious about it all her life?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been here four days.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never even said hello.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like I care.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just said because... It doesn't look proper.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather keep it between us.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she keeps at it, I'll finish her where she won't have an ounce of relief!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa what?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness knows who she thinks she is... Her type are the maids in London!

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want me to tell her that?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be my guest. Like I fear her.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't really have to though...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just said it in a fit of rage...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does the Gang have right now?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more than 2 grand.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
2 grand in four years!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember you had 90 grand when I left?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't a good planner...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not about money, at least. We almost got 50 gee from Dad,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she opened the letter again just five minutes before, and started crying...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I can't blackmail anyone in the name of love' and stuff...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What letter?
-Dad had a friend...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His classmate. She once wrote... 'Sorry, Dastoor, but I can't marry you'.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Followed by her entire story!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She also returned the 25 gee we got for the Foxy.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd worked so hard to get our hands on it.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Had pity on Gulrez?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She got furious.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over the engagement.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She virtually took the laddoo [sweet] from my mouth!

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen ain't marrying Gulrez.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is is she loves to toy with her food before she eats it!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll have him sell the Foxy!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, mate...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves her!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows it too...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she hates his Foxy.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Hmm' what?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
