1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd recognise my voice.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your voice

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sounds familiar.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sound like my dirty rotten cousin.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your dirty rotten cousin.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How dare you call me?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard you cried that day. After the slap...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel guilty.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you seriously 'so'-ing my sympathy?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, Waqar Ahmed,

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare call me again. Like, ever.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not allowed. Get it?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, but I've got one last thing to say to you...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate you.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I HATE YOU TOOOOOO!!!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blighter!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Six.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Again!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone remembers the slap...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Including Dado!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But no one bothers to ask what she was gonna do.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She nicked the Colonel's puppy.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal. It was so cute. We couldn't find another one like it.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Fajr... We would've been in the nick for the next six months!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why me? I was just a kid!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I leave home for a few days and you turn into pirates proper.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy, Waqar.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado and Uncle Dastoor are members too.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado doesn't even know

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She stole the Colonel's puppy.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, she'd only care about the slap...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... I slapped her... Big deal!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does she have to be furious about it all her life?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been here four days.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never even said hello.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like I care.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just said because... It doesn't look proper.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather keep it between us.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she keeps at it, I'll finish her where she won't have an ounce of relief!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa what?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness knows who she thinks she is... Her type are the maids in London!

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want me to tell her that?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be my guest. Like I fear her.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't really have to though...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just said it in a fit of rage...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does the Gang have right now?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more than 2 grand.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
2 grand in four years!

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember you had 90 grand when I left?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't a good planner...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not about money, at least. We almost got 50 gee from Dad,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she opened the letter again just five minutes before, and started crying...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I can't blackmail anyone in the name of love' and stuff...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What letter?
-Dad had a friend...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His classmate. She once wrote... 'Sorry, Dastoor, but I can't marry you'.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Followed by her entire story!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She also returned the 25 gee we got for the Foxy.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd worked so hard to get our hands on it.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? Had pity on Gulrez?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She got furious.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over the engagement.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She virtually took the laddoo [sweet] from my mouth!

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen ain't marrying Gulrez.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is is she loves to toy with her food before she eats it!

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll have him sell the Foxy!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, mate...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loves her!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She knows it too...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she hates his Foxy.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Hmm' what?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Hmm', as in...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could wreck her ego in minutes... But it seems you folks

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't got the guts.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very simple.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gang meeting.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This evening.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's oust her from the Chiefship.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly... D'you think the badmin deserves such an important position?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't, but she's been running the gang on her pocket money for four years.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she got wind of it, you can bet anything

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't even say hello to you for a hundred years!

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse her hello.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- I wasn't conspiring for real. I just wanted to check...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you've got even an ounce of loyalty in you.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And truly speaking,

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm impressed.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, wow...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on with your game.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahoy, matey!

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd you get here?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme greet Aunt!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be 'pon you!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you! Bless you! Long live!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the wee lassie?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wee lassie ain't so wee now. She's at her Nano's.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My cousin's here.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who slapped me!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You still remember?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always will.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Qutb!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Qutb!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd like a cuppa!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... When'd you get back from London?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Four days back.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter got back four days back too!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was on the plane with me. Right by me, in fact!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gorblimey, matey... Do I sense something goin' on?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're friends. That's all.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Just friends.</i>

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I found out he's your cousin when I got here,

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now that he's the one who slapped you.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exchanged numbers yet?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It becomes one in a while, matey...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I am not that cheap.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here to get engaged to you or something.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm also not that cheap!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at the lawn, it looks like you folks stopped playing cricket after I left.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After Nano's knee got hurt, actually.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She jumped on the crease last Sunday.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unfortunately, she lost both the score and her knee.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she's fine now.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're looking at a match after lunch.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
An India vs Pakistan match, no less!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think any of you folks can beat me?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Beat you? She'll blow you out of the water.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Water?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's playing with fire, you know.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, she's gonna set the stage on fire. Her fours and sixes burn the bowlers to ashes!

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please. My bouncer will knock her for six.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ha ha ha...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the 'Ha ha'? Don't believe me?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>'Ha ha', because you don't believe it!</i>

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bowl a bouncer and she says, 'Lovely shot, mate'!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can ask Gulrez if you want.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who does he play for these days?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plays for Maheen.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amazing...

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't get along.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't understand each other.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they play together.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very nice.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, it is.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gee, mate, I'm just asking where Gulrez is.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him to come see me.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me... What'd Maheen say?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where does she come in?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come. I've got something to show you.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon already.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta see this!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at that?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got this for Gulrez.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a lovely new car!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose is it?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought it's about time things changed...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the bugger here.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't tell him?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd surprise him.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray, too...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Simple, Uncle...

218
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,588
<i>Pray he doesn't surprise you.</i>

219
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,638
I mean, look here...

220
00:11:55,638 --> 00:12:00,190
He's been busy with a cheapjack mechanic, trying to get this fixed, until...

221
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,299
He got tired and dozed off inside her.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got a car to return now, I guess...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how many hearts I've broken when I left the engagement,

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the extent to which Gulrez was guilty of hatching that plot,

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I do know he's guilty.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, he may be nice,

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may love me, as they all say,

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why does no one seem to care that I don't love him at all?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was Nano.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Match over at her place.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I made it clear. I ain't playin' if that blighter is.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, mate.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got to.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard him say, 'Don't call her, Dado'!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Or my bouncer's gonna break her face'!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd play bouncers?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't seen me play. It's going up and away!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter will be knocked for six.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, someone's real furious.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I despise him!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- Look here!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He slapped me right here!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They could see the scar for five days!

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- Not to mention the pain!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jaysus...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've sworn

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To get even.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm sure

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That one day

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get my chance.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you marry him?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easiest way to get your opportunity, darling. Become his wife!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to punish him...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not myself, matey!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay... I'll get going. Enjoy the match!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait!

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The match is after lunch.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Found someone or still single?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still looking...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't be for long...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You? Looking?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't kid me, matey.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find someone who's looking for you.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor was here.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you tell me?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were sleeping. Inside your Foxy.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd got you a new car, but, seeing you in her arms, he thought he'd rather leave.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I do with a new car?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but the rest of us all think

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd change someday, a miracle would happen someday, and you'll change for someone...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to marry someone someday, yes?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen refused?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen won't refuse.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if Uncle Dastoor told her this thing about the Foxy?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me if you love Maheen or fear her?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't fear anyone.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You go white at the thought of her refusing.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you just said she won't!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's where you're wrong, silly.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You trust others

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To know what's in her heart.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out of these... Apprehension...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gather your courage. She's your Aunt's girl.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just face her and ask her why she left without a word the moment they brought up the engagement! It's perfectly okay!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want me to ask her that?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you want to ask that? Me?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor or Ammi Begum?

304
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,888
Know what,

305
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:58,238
You're the type who love without quite understanding it.

306
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,098
Love is a force that seizes your heart.

307
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,928
A force that awes. A force that reigns.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize her heart.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as you're in her heart,

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Distances won't matter. No one else would be able to conquer her.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well said!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! Maheen?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Water!

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
S -- She'll be fine, Dado...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some water!

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado -- She --

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the car. Maheen's had an accident!

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With a car?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, with Waqar! Get the car out, I'm coming in a second!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of all the people he could bump into...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A slap four years back,

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now this crash.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't do it on purpose.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was just trying to catch the ball.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please... It wasn't the India vs Pakistan match or something...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you'd rather we lose the match!

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if we've won!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We still missed the catch.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Because someone had to drop in at the wrongest moment!</i>

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For siding with him,

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll kill you, Fajr!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter did it on purpose!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Nano?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Look at how...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shameless he is!

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't even come to check on her.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dare him!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd break his face!

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His arm broke.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now you'd break his face...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His arm -- What?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been hurt bad.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ran to the doctor in pain.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His arm broke?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord... What happened to my little girl?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, Suraiyya.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not her arm.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're talking about Waqar.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's gone to the doctor.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone here was concerned about Maheen,

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leaving him to help himself.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took the car and left.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Better?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, better now.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder why you're doing any of this...

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No questions, you bugger... Back to work!

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got so many patients!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't I one of them?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't I?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, what about my arm X-ray?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How d'you think I could possibly get you one?

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get it, sir.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lady who had an accident and died...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've still got her arm X-ray.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd give him her X-ray?

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You serious? Her arm was pulverised!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, it's okay. Gimme that one.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, give me hers.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you want to impress with that?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't impressin' anyone, boyo!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to one-up someone.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A witch.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you when I'm better. We'll party hard.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've never been better!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That... Stays between us.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado thinks I've broken my arm.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I only care about her.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can handle everyone else.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget your sling!

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next patient, please!

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What...

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got hurt.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you get the X-ray from the side seat?

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly... C'mon!

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broken?

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who cursed him?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine, Aunt! Just a scratch...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With that sling...

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't look much like a scratch!

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- You cried out the moment Ammi Begum hugged you...

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broke my arm...

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry... Just a fracture, Aunt...

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broke your arm?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay, Dado...

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll heal.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me... How's she?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... He's asking about her without a care about his own arm...

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's she, Aunt? I asked something!

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's fine!

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just -- Creates a scene.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a little bump on her head... That's all... She's fine now!

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all -- Because of me...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way... You aren't responsible for any of it...

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was destined to happen...

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who, including you, could know

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd drop in right when you were about to catch the ball?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take you to your room.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay, Aunt. I can go on my own.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just take care of her...

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or she'll think...

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This was chapter 2 of the slap.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt...

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not my fault, but...

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it your fault?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just bumped into her.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some rest. You need it.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really need it...

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go with him, you twits! What are you waiting for?

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His X-ray.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can anyone tell me what you see?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His bone's pulverised, Mum!

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Heavens.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pulverised? Where?

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here, Aunt!

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at his elbow...

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, where... It's been utterly destroyed...

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me...

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His right elbow... Blimey...

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how can that be?

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean -- He was on his feet alright!

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a man.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can take a broken elbow.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you know

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he was on his feet or fell down?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were unconscious until we sprinkled some water on you.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Effin' ice cube.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eh?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's an effin' ice cube, Mum!

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd be out cold forever!

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who we were so worried about.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We didn't even think about what happened to him.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's fine!

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's just putting up an act!

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, Maheen...

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you hear him cry in pain

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment Ammi Begum hugged him?

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- D'you think it's all a lie?

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This X-ray and all?

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd he get hurt that bad?

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One bump into me broke his arm?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pulverised, more like? Something just seems <i>off</i>!</i>

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One bump into this ice cube, and she was out cold for five minutes!

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sound delighted.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, I ain't exactly delighted... But it felt nice... Sorta.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme tell her.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not cricket, mate!

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna ruin everything!

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... To be honest, I've got hurt too... Broke my arm.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke your arm and yet you're so lively and energetic?

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, I broke it... Sorta... Got it bandaged and all.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Swear by me.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? I hate this thing.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Swear by me', 'swear by your head'...

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I said I broke my arm. Why don't you just believe it?

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'm coming to see you.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wanna check on you... Get you some flowers... Maybe even a 'get well soon' card! The little stuff, you know...

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. The doctor wants me to rest. I need it badly. Bye.

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you come over...

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For some ice cream?

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ice cream?

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. I know you love it.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout tomorrow?

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick your poison!

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come over, or I'm coming!

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'm coming.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say it already?

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it that

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't say before Suraiyya?

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bad news, but those greys don't quite reflect experience.

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Says who?

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone can see it!

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me why?

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you didn't see why.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess I did...

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His right arm was away from Maheen!

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So how'd the crash break his right arm?

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Touché...

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the bandage...

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean it was all an act?

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure a doctor bandaged him?

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want his name?

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dr Imran!

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar's old school-fellow!

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Imran.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get my diary.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why'd he do it?

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To one-up Maheen!

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't notice

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much you were worried for her when she got hurt!

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone forgot her

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment they heard about his broken arm.

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to mention the pulverised bone...

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he was trying to outfox us!

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him right now.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here!

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imran?

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Waqar's Dado. Kaneez Begum.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no one in here...

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd the lad go?

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go... Ask Munshi Alam to look for him.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time.

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now where'd he hole up?

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Mehru, Aunt Suraiyya, Fajr, Ali...

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were all huddled 'round her like she were some goldmine or something.

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear they were cursing me behind my back!

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this dit about my broken arm

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave them all a proper fright!

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Dado

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned white, I tell you!

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard her pain when she said, 'Waqar'...

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone gathered around me. Worried.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They all forgot her in a sec.

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bet she's disapppointed.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The agony's gonna kill her before sunrise.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you'd be happy to see her like that.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eh?

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, not really like that...

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But -- I don't know, Jiya...

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She gets my back up!

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what she thinks she is.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you get hurt?

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My elbow.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me.

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't see it.

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was fibbing, mate.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't always lie. Except to her. Somehow.

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess you

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Carry a torch for her.

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you touched in the head?

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's the only one in the entire world I could never like one bit.

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about me?

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a friend, Jiya. I like all my friends.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told you before.

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe a boy and a girl can be just friends.

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

612
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with it?

613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- What else are we?

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do we talk for hours on the phone? Why do we see each other? And why -- This ice cream -- And all?

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you think you are? Me Aunt's girl? A business partner?

616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm! Wait, wait, wait!

617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least finish your ice cream! Jiya!

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just kidding, Jiya! Hey!

619
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
