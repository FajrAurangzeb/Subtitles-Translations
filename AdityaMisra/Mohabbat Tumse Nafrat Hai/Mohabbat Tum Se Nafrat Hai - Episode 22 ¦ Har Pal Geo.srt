1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
foo

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Gulrez say?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing. He just took me to the beach and asked me to forget that he ever loved Maheen.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Loved'? I asked him.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't reply.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then he took me shopping. Said I'd have to wear the sherwani he picked.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shoes, shirt, sherwani... He got me everything.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess what, he said he's proving he's no Scrooge. He just spends wisely.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got me the most expensive things he could find.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So sweet of him.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know who's putting up the most lively dance upstairs?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he said he can't dance!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta see his belly dance!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you pity him?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bit.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do too.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I feel that love is selfish. Very selfish.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My love can make me do anything... Except give my Maheen to Gulrez.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you pick fights with me after we're married?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't mind that. Just... Just don't slap me, okay?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not the kind who'd slap... That was just -- you might've been arrested!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway. Forget the slap.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I? You gave me a scar right here!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't we talk about something else?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever said sorry?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Twice!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to keep saying sorry as long as I live.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say sorry as long as I live. Okay?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

34
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:17,144
What's up?

35
00:36:18,905 --> 00:36:22,568
W -- What? We were just -- You know -- Havin' a chat?

36
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:27,569
I'm growing old waiting for one of you to say 'I love you'!

37
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:36,825
Say it, will you, Waqar?

38
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:39,735
I really want to hear the three magical words!

39
00:36:44,362 --> 00:36:46,712
There goes your chance.

40
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,170
I'll say it for everyone to hear on the wedding day.

41
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,260
You have my word.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
