1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it, Neelam?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was dreaming...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A wedding...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen and Waqar's.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what,

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She looked so lovely as the bride...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Waqar... Mind-blowing...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw them seated together...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Fajr clicking pictures like mad!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Reverend was about to start with the vows when you woke me up.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you laughing?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano thinks

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't augur.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then...</i>

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you...</i>

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And then I will forget you...</i>

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided it now...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll marry him.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask why.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you love him.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nopes.
-Why, then?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya told me that's the only way I can get even.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marrying him.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please, look at yourself.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see him in your eyes.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My eyes?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny. Don't you see they're so bright and lovely?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've always known it.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves him!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quit lying. I've seen it for myself.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember when Jiya held his hand and took him away?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she ended the match?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ended her life, more like.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I broke up.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First time I saw someone green with envy.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it like?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh, a lot. But surely not bright and lovely!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your phone's ringing.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Your phone's ringing.</i>

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to see who it is?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Romeo.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Romeo?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Mashood Ahmed.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear you're happy.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, you said yes?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've thrown the young'uns a party too.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She means us!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head? Marrying your enemy?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm scheming...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd so love to kill you with my own bare hands!

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought about Gulrez?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought about yourself?

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The name's Maheen Aurangzeb. I can count the feathers of a bird in the air.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to me?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can keep counting your feathers while he'd die under the weight of his Foxy.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, can it. You've been caught.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you admit that you love me?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I don't love you one bit.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't take Dado too seriously, by the way.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just settling scores.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you hear that load of guff!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on, mate?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're getting us married!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been so mad as to say yes!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her I'm not interested at all!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Somewhere. Havin' a ball.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Fajr...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so scared...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you smiling?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's soooo scared...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here. 50.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
50 gee?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your tip.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Much appreciated.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enjoy yourself.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get your 20 gee every month.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll live a life of luxury.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Much appreciated.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big trouble, mate.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's getting me married.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says yes.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to you, mate.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not marrying her!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't take Gulrez's curses!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know how much he loves her?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More than you, I guess?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't love her more than you!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just worried...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You pity him... That's all...

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel like I've sinned, Jia...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't have said it to Dado.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Said what?

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lied to her!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just teasing Maheen when I said I love her.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were honest.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do love her.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll crash into a wall.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was lying!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even told Maheen I don't love her! Why don't you folks get it?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll have to prove it...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I prove it to you?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell Maheen

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love Jiya.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Hello?
Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You there?
Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Waqar?
Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told Neelam...

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit's brave.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she's waiting for the sweets!

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told Wali too.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He congratulated me.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I know...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't really mean it.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look what we have here...

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at her march in like royalty!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls don't behave so brazenly before their marriage!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if anyone saw you?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't want me to tell you...

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the anger?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar says he's not interested.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you saying it in English?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said it in English.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does he mean?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't want to marry Maheen.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, disown him, Ammi Begum.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, Dastoor Ahmed.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What now?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's like the twit has the crow before his eyes

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But says it's not black!

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's barking mad!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, he's got the crow right in his sights but says it's not black! Like, seriously?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you please do us a favour and keep quiet?

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what are you looking at?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I say, Ammi Begum?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he's not happy... Forget it?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to see a proper scene?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll say

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd die without Maheen at the top of his lungs.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You thinking of bewitching him?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor's company is affecting you...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take my hand.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Ali?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Outside.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stand guard here...

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a few spells to cast.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reminds me of something Dad would say...

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was when I was hiding from him, scared...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He walked past me, holding Ammi Begum's hand...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And said,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You've got me under your spell'.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you said

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not marrying Maheen.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You serious about that?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you love her?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find out where she is!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with you, Dado?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got the perfect truth serum for you...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait and watch...

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's gonna be crystal clear...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you calling?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called Maheen here?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough...

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's your truth serum.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Geroff me!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a last look.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stand by him.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think one final time

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're gonna change your mind?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
-Now swear by Maheen's head...

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now swear by Maheen's head...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't love her.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pray you see me dead if you lie under oath.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've surprised us all.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All of you are here.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're so delighted.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're happy, aren't you?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All my kids have a thing for theatrics...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every one of them.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're here to mourn a promise unfulfilled...

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, forgive us...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Aunt Suraiyya?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That twit's not family...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've always considered him a brother.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's like an old friend.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember, Nano,

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How I picked her up, the little girl?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She nearly slipped and fell.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let her this time.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll get

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever she asks for.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you all, how are you?

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great, Aunt. You?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're happy, aren't you?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not home, Nano.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, he just left.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gone where?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't ask him now.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Foxy starts without any problems now.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn the key,

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And full steam ahead!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why I brought you here.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying to venture a guess.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna ask me to forget that you love her...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you to forget

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That I loved her.</i>

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if 'love' ever changes to 'loved'.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So if you saw me talking to her, would you think I love her?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course not.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All that matters to me

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is who hates her.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a great man.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not greater than you.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been very kind. Generous.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't get engaged though, Waqar.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get married straight away.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Engagements break.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you say so.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But promise me...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even let me finish it.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do as you say.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get married.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gonna ask Neelam to find me a match.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you look yourself?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find your dream girl?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart would like to have its way.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't do it, Waqar.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let it. Not again.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll play cricket together again.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be in Maheen's team.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll knock 'em for six!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wedding will be on Sunday.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd get them engaged,

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Mehru said engagements can break.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to everyone.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wedding's on Sunday.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good news!

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's gone over to Neelam's.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say Gulrez's!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would, but Gulrez isn't home.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he?

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out with Waqar.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took Waqar with him just a while back.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A girl's two lovers should never meet before her marriage!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd wear a suit?

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No. You'd wear one.</i>

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm buying you your wedding suit!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't turn me down.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the most expensive one.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone thinks I'm a Scrooge.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want them to know

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not a Scrooge.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just... Careful about where I spend.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a look.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But remember -

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick only the most elegant

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And the most expensive suit.</i>

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are they up to?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe ask Gulrez?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I care if you don't?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, I'm glad.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They ought to see each other.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So there's no bad blood.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But aye...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost forgot...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not getting engaged. You're getting married right away!

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum asked me...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said okay.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Engagements can break...

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Sup, matey?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone sounds a bit too lively!

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hit the jackpot, eh, matey?

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jackpot?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everything.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday... Your handsome Romeo...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it... As if I'm any less!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna be the crown jewel, matey!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saturday. Sleepover. Okay?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No excuses.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No excuses.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love you.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ooh...

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never thought you could say that.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what...

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't said that to him yet.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Learning.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congrats to you too.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any idea

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much I've helped you?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say the three words before me? Please? I'd love to watch it live!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Belt up and bog off!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely. Just -- Lovely!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how you thank me!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one loves me!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love you.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with the practice!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually -- Hate you, Fajr!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's when he lost it.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He seized my hand.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pushed him away and struck him with a vase,

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But by then, a car had stopped outside...

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He made a run for it, rubbing his face,

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But - curse my luck -

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad had seen him...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Going through it all... It was almost like... I lost my mind...

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could never imagine Aurangzeb doing any of it... Not least to me!

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was startled to see your Dad walk in.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It felt like being caught red-handed.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He asked questions

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I said whatever I came up with.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was the moment

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ruined my life

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forever.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bout time your past caught up to you, Aurangzeb.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The flames that charred my family and our lives

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are about to engulf your daughter.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I will make sure she burns...

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She's mine,</i>

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah she's mine!</i>

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She's mine,</i>

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah she's mine!</i>

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She's mine,</i>

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Yeah she's mine!</i>

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think you're doing? Got the manners to - maybe - knock before you enter a girl's room?

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, this is my Dado's room.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame.
-Shame?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my Aunt's daughter. My cousin.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now... My wife to-be.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with all the shame?
-Stop right there, you villain!

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, girl, you mean hero? What's wrong with you?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Speak for yourself... What's wrong with you?</i>

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never forget I can break the hand that dares touch me.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll break my hands?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I didn't get hold of you today...

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll break them myself.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're gonna be a goner!

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one can hear a word out there.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sure she'll hear that cowardly squeal?

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call me a coward?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't even started yet --
-N -- Nano!

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You silly girl...

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd call out to everyone... But not my name. Just once? Please?

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at yourself. You look like a bleedin' Paki!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna marry this Paki?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In your dreams!

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the Reverend asks me, I'll say... 'I won't'!

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait until I get my hands on you, girl!

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd rather die.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa. Someone got too serious.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go...

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step aside.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My touch will bring you back to life.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke my bangles...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get you new ones.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh you will?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because who else will?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it...

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you love me?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget love... I don't even hate you.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ravish you.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when I do, you'll have to tell everyone...

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll claw that face!

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say you love me. It's a lot easier.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't!

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll let go.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough... That's enough...

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm knackered...

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rest a while.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Waqar, will you? I'd love to see him dance.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, but...

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is he?

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seriously, what are you made of?

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Gulrez say?

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just took me to the beach and asked me to forget that he ever loved Maheen.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Loved'? I asked him.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't say anything.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then he took me shopping.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Said I'd have to wear the sherwani he picked.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shoes, shirt, sherwani... He got me everything.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess what, he said he's proving he's no Scrooge. He just spends wisely.

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got me the most expensive things he could find.

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So sweet of him.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know who's putting up the most lively dance upstairs?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he said he can't dance!

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gotta see his belly dance!

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you pity him?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bit.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do too.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I feel that love is selfish.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very selfish.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My love can make me do anything...

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except give my Maheen to Gulrez.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you pick fights with me after we're married?

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't mind that. Just...

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just don't slap me, okay?

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not the kind who'd slap...

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was just -- you might've been arrested!

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway. Forget the slap.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can I?

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gave me a scar right here!

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't we talk about something else?

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever said sorry?

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Twice!

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want you

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To keep saying sorry

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as I live.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say sorry as long as I live.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry.

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
W -- What? We were just -- You know -- Havin' a chat?

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm growing old waiting for one of you to say 'I love you'!

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it, will you, Waqar?

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I really want to hear the three magical words!

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There goes your chance.

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say it for everyone to hear on the wedding day.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have my word.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
