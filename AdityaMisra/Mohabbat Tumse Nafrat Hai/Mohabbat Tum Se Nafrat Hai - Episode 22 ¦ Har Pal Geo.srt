1
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,634
Gulrez...

2
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,788
Gulrez?

3
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,117
Gulrez!

4
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,563
What is it, Neelam?

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,913
I was dreaming...

6
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,108
About?

7
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,378
A wedding...

8
00:01:16,313 --> 00:01:18,028
Whose?

9
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:21,579
Maheen and Waqar's.

10
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,097
Know what,

11
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:29,813
She looked so lovely as the bride...

12
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,212
And Waqar... Mind-blowing...

13
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,604
I saw them seated together...

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,092
And Fajr clicking pictures like mad!

15
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,468
The Reverend was about to start with the vows when you woke me up.

16
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,984
What happened?

17
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,788
Why are you laughing?

18
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,158
Nano thinks

19
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,601
You can't augur.

20

26
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,804
I've decided it now...

27
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,762
I'll marry him.

28
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:25,922
Ask why.

29
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:28,496
Because you love him.

30
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,405
Nopes.
-Why, then?

31
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,938
Jiya told me that's the only way I can get even.

32
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,739
Marrying him.

33
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,253
Oh, please, look at yourself.

34
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,409
I can see him in your eyes.

35
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,163
My eyes?

36
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:47,935
Very funny. Don't you see they're so bright and lovely?

37
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,516
I've always known it.

38
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,533
What?

39
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:51,858
She loves him!

40
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,488
Put a sock in it!

41
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,460
Quit lying. I've seen it for myself.

42
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,800
Remember when Jiya held his hand and took him away?

43
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,166
When she ended the match?

44
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,057
Ended her life, more like.

45
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:06,898
Shut up!

46
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:08,240
You broke.

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,988
And I broke up.

48
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:13,458
First time I saw someone green with envy.

49
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,870
What's it like?

50
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,948
Ooh, a lot. But surely not bright and lovely!

51
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:20,988
Your phone's ringing.

52
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,688
<i>Your</i> phone's ringing.

53
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:28,113
Care to see who it is?

54
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:29,864
Whoa...

55
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,220
Your Romeo.

56
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,816
Romeo?

57
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,337
Waqar Mashood Ahmed.

58
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,038
Whoa...

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,391
Hello?

60
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:46,371
I hear you're happy.

61
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,431
As in, you said yes?

62
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,735
I've thrown the young'uns a party too.

63
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,782
She means us!

64
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:57,513
You off your head? Marrying your enemy?

65
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,323
I'm scheming...

66
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:02,766
I'd so love to kill you with my own bare hands!

67
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,424
Very funny.

68
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,168
Ever thought about Gulrez?

69
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,409
Ever thought about yourself?

70
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,893
What?

71
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:15,688
The name's Maheen Aurangzeb. I can count the feathers of a bird in the air.

72
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,009
So?

73
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,022
What's it to me?

74
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:23,183
You can keep counting your feathers while he'd die under the weight of his Foxy.

75
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,980
Oh, can it. You've been caught.

76
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,299
Why don't you admit that you love me?

77
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,879
I swear I don't love you one bit.

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,395
Don't take Dado too seriously, by the way.

79
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:39,900
I was just settling scores.

80
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,460
Would you hear that load of guff!

81
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,209
What is it?

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,528
Who?

83
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:47,058
Fajr.

84
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:49,099
What's going on, mate?

85
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,251
They're getting us married!

86
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:52,492
So?

87
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,130
She's been so mad as to say yes!

88
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,538
Tell her I'm not interested at all!

89
00:05:58,591 --> 00:05:59,762
Where are you?

90
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,762
Somewhere. Havin' a ball.

91
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,310
I'll get back to you...

92
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,011
Wait, Fajr...

93
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:06,898
Aye?

94
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:09,989
I'm so scared...

95
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,601
Why are you smiling?

96
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:18,801
He's soooo scared...

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,139
Hey!

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,338
Here. 50.

99
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,758
50 gee?

100
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,261
Your tip.

101
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:02,426
Much appreciated.

102
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:04,943
Enjoy yourself.

103
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,870
You'll get your 20 gee every month.

104
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,210
You'll live a life of luxury.

105
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,570
Much appreciated.

106
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,998
Waqar?

107
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,041
Big trouble, mate.

108
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,458
What?

109
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:34,930
Dado's getting me married.

110
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,348
To?

111
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:38,598
Maheen.

112
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,869
What'd she say?

113
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,320
She says yes.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,654
Congratulations.

115
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:56,760
What?

116
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,728
Congratulations to you, mate.

117
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,998
Why?

118
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:01,968
I'm not marrying her!

119
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,624
I can't take Gulrez's curses!

120
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,920
D'you know how much he loves her?

121
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,420
How much?

122
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,323
Yeah?

123
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,050
More than you, I guess?

124
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,455
I swear...

125
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:26,342
He doesn't love her more than you!

126
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,480
You're just worried...

127
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,022
You pity him... That's all...

128
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,429
I feel like I've sinned, Jiya...

129
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,428
I shouldn't have said it to Dado.

130
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,578
Said what?

131
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,828
I lied to her!

132
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:49,164
I was just teasing Maheen when I said I love her.

133
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:51,220
You were honest.

134
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:53,688
You do love her.

135
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,942
I'll crash into a wall.

136
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,871
I was lying!

137
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,730
I even told Maheen I don't love her! Why don't you folks get it?

138
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,741
You'll have to prove it...

139
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,994
How?

140
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,225
How can I prove it to you?

141
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,940
Go and tell Maheen

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,046
You love Jiya.

152
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,016
The twit's brave.

153
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:55,356
She said she's waiting for the sweets!

154
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,737
I told Wali too.

155
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:00,207
He congratulated me.

156
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,198
But I know...

157
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,460
He didn't really mean it.

158
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,274
Look what we have here...

159
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:32,054
Look at her march in like royalty!

160
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:35,214
Have some shame...

161
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,727
Girls don't behave so brazenly before their marriage!

162
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,828
What if anyone saw you?

163
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,648
What?

164
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,720
You don't want me to tell you...

165
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,858
What's with the anger?

166
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,998
Waqar says he's not interested.

167
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,933
Why are you saying it in English?

168
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:13,229
He said it in English.

169
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,339
What does he mean?

170
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,514
He doesn't want to marry Maheen.

171
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,829
My...

172
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:45,908
I say, disown him, Ammi Begum.

173
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:49,199
Hold your horses, Dastoor Ahmed.

174
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,380
What now?

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,043
It's like the twit has the crow before his eyes

176
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:02,308
But says it's not black!

177
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,839
That's barking mad!

178
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:11,889
I mean, he's got the crow right in his sights but says it's not black! Like, seriously?

179
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,589
Could you please do us a favour and keep quiet?

180
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,458
And what are you looking at?

181
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,078
What d'you think?

182
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,478
What can I say, Ammi Begum?

183
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:37,239
If he's not happy... Forget it?

184
00:12:38,448 --> 00:12:41,179
You want to see a proper scene?

185
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,449
I know

186
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,630
He'll say

187
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,601
He'd die without Maheen at the top of his lungs.

188
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,679
You thinking of bewitching him?

189
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,788
My...

190
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,641
Dastoor's company is affecting you...

191
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,878
Take my hand.

192
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,318
Fajr...

193
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,959
Here...

194
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:16,981
Where's Ali?

195
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:18,311
Outside.

196
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:21,142
Stand guard here...

197
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:23,100
I've got a few spells to cast.

198
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,738
C'mon.

199
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,258
Reminds me of something Dad would say...

200
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,029
It was when I was hiding from him, scared...

201
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,349
He walked past me, holding Ammi Begum's hand...

202
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,018
And said,

203
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:51,828
'You've got me under your spell'.

204
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,008
Aye.

205
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,158
So you said

206
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:12,298
You're not marrying Maheen.

207
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:15,033
You serious about that?

208
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,949
Don't you love her?

209
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,898
Find out where she is!

210
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,338
What's wrong with you, Dado?

211
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,569
I've got the perfect truth serum for you...

212
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:32,269
Wait and watch...

213
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:36,489
Everything's gonna be crystal clear...

214
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,598
Who are you calling?

215
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,148
Sit.

216
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,709
C'mon.

217
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,020
You called Maheen here?

218
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,320
Aye.

219
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,570
Fair enough...

220
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,442
She's your truth serum.

221
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,387
She's here!

222
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,978
Geroff me!

223
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:07,987
Have a last look.

224
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,911
Stand by him.

225
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,521
Good.

226
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,658
So...

227
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,749
Could you

228
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,298
Think one final time

229
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,818
If you're gonna change your mind?

230
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,971
I won't.

231
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,710
Say the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

232
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,630
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

233
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,408
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
-Now swear by Maheen's head...

234
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:54,619
Now swear by Maheen's head...

235
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,950
You don't love her.

236
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,347
Go on.

237
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,878
I pray you see me dead if you lie under oath.

238
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,178
Nano...

239
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:13,018
You've surprised us all.

240
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,468
All of you are here.

241
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,128
We're so delighted.

242
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,760
You're happy, aren't you?

243
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,211
All my kids have a thing for theatrics...

244
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,879
Every one of them.

245
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,588
We're here to mourn a promise unfulfilled...

246
00:17:43,618 --> 00:17:45,748
Please, forgive us...

247
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:49,698
What are you saying, Aunt Suraiyya?

248
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:55,028
That twit's not family...

249
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,987
But I've always considered him a brother.

250
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,821
And she's like an old friend.

251
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,808
Remember, Nano,

252
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:09,548
How I picked her up, the little girl?

253
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,738
She nearly slipped and fell.

254
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,249
I won't let her this time.

255
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,471
She'll get

256
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,881
Whatever she asks for.

257
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,660
Peace be upon you all, how are you?

258
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,952
How are you?

259
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,670
Great, Aunt. You?

260
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,670
You're happy, aren't you?

261
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,520
But...

262
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,310
Where's Gulrez?

263
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,940
He's not home, Nano.

264
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,436
In fact, he just left.

265
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:45,436
Gone where?

266
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,477
I don't ask him now.

267
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,849
Guess what,

268
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,738
His Foxy starts without any problems now.

269
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,160
Turn the key,

270
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,131
And full steam ahead!

271
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,519
Ask me

272
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,229
Why I brought you here.

273
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,859
I'm trying to venture a guess.

274
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,478
I know

275
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,501
You're gonna ask me to forget that you love her...

276
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,391
No, Waqar.

277
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,910
I want you to forget

278
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,338
That I <i>loved</i> her.

279
00:19:44,338 --> 00:19:47,958
As if 'love' ever changes to 'loved'.

280
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,150
So if you saw me talking to her, would you think I love her?

281
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,760
Of course not.

282
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,480
All that matters to me

283
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,711
Is who hates her.

284
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,958
You're a great man.

285
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,561
No way.

286
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,471
Not greater than you.

287
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,090
You've been very kind. Generous.

288
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,948
Don't get engaged though, Waqar.

289
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,889
Why?

290
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,461
Get married straight away.

291
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,573
Engagements break.

292
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:29,873
Okay.

293
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,844
If you say so.

294
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,839
But promise me...

295
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,919
I do.

296
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,168
You didn't even let me finish it.

297
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:39,952
I'll do as you say.

298
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,810
Get married.

299
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,858
I will.

300
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,418
When?

301
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:48,818
I'm

302
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,211
Gonna ask Neelam to find me a match.

303
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,078
Why don't you look yourself?

304
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:56,388
Yeah?

305
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,129
Find your dream girl?

306
00:20:58,129 --> 00:20:59,581
Never.

307
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,550
My heart would like to have its way.

308
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,641
I can't do it, Waqar.

309
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,151
I won't let it. Not again.

310
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,498
We'll play cricket together again.

311
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,701
I won't be in Maheen's team.

312
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,588
Instead...

313
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,225
I'll knock 'em for six!

314
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,248
The wedding will be on Sunday.

315
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,358
I thought

316
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,628
We'd get them engaged,

317
00:21:44,748 --> 00:21:48,969
But Mehru said engagements can break.

318
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,978
Congratulations.

319
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,818
Congratulations to everyone.

320
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,949
The wedding's on Sunday.

321
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,570
Good news!

322
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,011
Everyone's gone over to Neelam's.

323
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,066
Say Gulrez's!

324
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:56,272
I would, but Gulrez isn't home.

325
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,906
Where's he?

326
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,905
Out with Waqar.

327
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,252
He took Waqar with him just a while back.

328
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,493
Where?

329
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,344
No idea.

330
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,363
Blimey...

331
00:23:09,434 --> 00:23:10,474
What happened?

332
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:15,601
A girl's two lovers should never meet before her marriage!

333
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:17,206
Is it?

334
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,969
Wow...

335
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,818
You'd wear a suit?

336
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,091
No. <i>You</i>'d wear one.

337
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:37,772
I'm buying you your wedding suit!

338
00:23:37,882 --> 00:23:39,263
Please...

339
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:40,953
Don't turn me down.

340
00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:42,623
I won't.

341
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,681
Get the most expensive one.

342
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,692
Everyone thinks I'm a Scrooge.

343
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:54,021
I want them to know

344
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,832
I'm not a Scrooge.

345
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,584
I'm just... Careful about where I spend.

346
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,101
Have a look.

347
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,568
But remember -

348
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,301
Pick only the most elegant

349
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,058
<i>And</i> the most expensive suit.

350
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,689
What are they up to?

351
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,169
No idea.

352
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,859
Maybe ask Gulrez?

353
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:35,630
What do I care if you don't?

354
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,349
I don't.

355
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:39,988
In fact, I'm glad.

356
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,249
They ought to see each other.

357
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,728
So there's no bad blood.

358
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,668
Fair enough.

359
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,908
But aye...

360
00:24:49,908 --> 00:24:52,098
I almost forgot...

361
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:53,428
Yeah?

362
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:56,928
You're not getting engaged. You're getting married right away!

363
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,778
I know.

364
00:24:58,909 --> 00:25:00,748
Mum asked me...

365
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:02,259
I said okay.

366
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,530
Engagements can break...

367
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,140
Jiya!

368
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,210
'Sup, matey?

369
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,478
Jiminy Cricket...

370
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,719
Someone sounds a bit too lively!

371
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:22,190
Hit the jackpot, eh, matey?

372
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:23,499
Jackpot?

373
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:25,330
I know everything.

374
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,330
Sunday... Your handsome Romeo...

375
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,680
Can it... As if I'm any less!

376
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,098
You're gonna be the crown jewel, matey!

377
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:38,790
Come here?

378
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:43,160
Saturday. Sleepover. Okay?

379
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,538
For real?

380
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:45,758
For real.

381
00:25:45,818 --> 00:25:47,448
No excuses.

382
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:49,168
No excuses.

383
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:50,668
I swear.

384
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,821
Love you.

385
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,351
Ooh...

386
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,472
Never thought you could say that.

387
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,828
Guess what...

388
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:05,049
Hmm?

389
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,648
I haven't said that to him yet.

390
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:09,969
Just... Learning.

391
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,051
Hey...

392
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,758
Yeah?

393
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,449
Congratulations.

394
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:28,328
Thank you.

395
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,001
Congrats to you too.

396
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,748
Any idea

397
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:42,138
How much I've helped you?

398
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:43,558
So?

399
00:26:43,828 --> 00:26:46,042
Say the three words before me? Please?

400
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:47,999
I'd love to watch it live!

401
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,372
Belt up and bog off!

402
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:53,749
Lovely. Just -- Lovely!

403
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,210
That's how you thank me!

404
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,479
No one loves me!

405
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,880
Love you.

406
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,130
Keep up with the practice!

407
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,607
Actually -- Hate you, Fajr!

408
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,963
That's when he lost it.

409
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,569
He seized my hand.

410
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:31,760
I pushed him away and struck him with a vase,

411
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,621
But by then, a car had stopped outside...

412
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,040
He made a run for it, rubbing his face,

413
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,748
But - curse my luck -

414
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,938
Your Dad had seen him...

415
00:27:49,158 --> 00:27:56,071
Going through it all... It was almost like... I lost my mind...

416
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:05,130
I could never imagine Aurangzeb doing any of it... Not least to me!

417
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:12,361
I was startled to see your Dad walk in.

418
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,548
It felt like being caught red-handed.

419
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,018
He asked questions

420
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:26,189
And I said whatever I came up with.

421
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,748
That was the moment

422
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:32,329
That ruined my life

423
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,690
Forever.

424
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,108
'Bout time your past caught up to you, Aurangzeb.

425
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,700
The flames that charred my family and our lives

426
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,948
Are about to engulf your daughter.

427
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,179
And I will make sure she burns...

428
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,180
♪ <i>She's mine,</i> ♪

429
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,084
♪ <i>Yeah she's mine!</i> ♪

430
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,227
♪ <i>She's mine...</i> ♪

431
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:37,058
♪ <i>Yeah she's mine!</i> ♪

432
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:38,189
♪ <i>She's mine,</i> ♪

433
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,410
♪ <i>Yeah she's mine!</i> ♪

434
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,088
What d'you think you're doing? Got the manners to - maybe - knock before you enter a girl's room?

435
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,059
Guess what, this is my Dado's room.

436
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,461
Have some shame.
-Shame?

437
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:03,222
Why?

438
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,508
You're my Aunt's daughter. My cousin.

439
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,908
And now... My wife to-be.

440
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,390
What's with all the shame?
-Stop right there, you villain!

441
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:18,300
Surely, girl, you mean hero? What's wrong with you?

442
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,550
Speak for yourself... What's wrong with <i>you</i>?

443
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,778
Never forget I can break the hand that dares touch me.

444
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,880
You'll break my hands?

445
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:29,849
If I didn't get hold of you today...

446
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,679
I'll break them myself.

447
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:34,349
You're gonna be a goner!

448
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,082
Mum!

449
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,523
No one can hear a word out there.

450
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:44,984
You sure she'll hear that cowardly squeal?

451
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:46,958
Did you call me a coward?

452
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,880
I ain't even started yet --
-N -- Nano!

453
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,520
You silly girl...

454
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,731
You'd call out to everyone... But not my name. Just once? Please?

455
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,511
Look at yourself. You look like a bleedin' Paki!

456
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,080
You gonna marry this Paki?

457
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,460
In your dreams!

458
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,813
When the Reverend asks me, I'll say...

459
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:06,831
'I won't'!

460
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,475
Wait until I get my hands on you, girl!

461
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:12,216
I'd rather die.

462
00:31:12,293 --> 00:31:13,684
I mean it.

463
00:31:15,764 --> 00:31:17,865
Whoa. Someone got too serious.

464
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,466
Please, go...

465
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,385
Yeah...

466
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,431
Step aside.

467
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,241
My touch will bring you back to life.

468
00:31:42,274 --> 00:31:44,215
You broke my bangles...

469
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:46,136
I'll get you new ones.

470
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:47,967
Oh you will?

471
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:50,708
Because who else will?

472
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
Leave it...

473
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:56,052
D'you love me?

474
00:31:56,118 --> 00:31:57,379
You?

475
00:31:57,443 --> 00:31:59,024
Forget love...

476
00:31:59,154 --> 00:32:00,884
I don't even hate you.

477
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:02,325
I'll ravish you.

478
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:04,720
And when I do, you'll have to tell everyone...

479
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,591
I'll claw that face!

480
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,378
Just say you love me. It's a lot easier.

481
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:13,058
I don't!

482
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:15,802
I'll let go.

483
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,528
Don't.

484
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,018
I won't.

485
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,720
Enough... That's enough...

486
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,530
I'm knackered...

487
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,541
Rest a while.

488
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:57,490
Call Waqar, will you? I'd love to see him dance.

489
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,198
Yeah, but...

490
00:32:59,502 --> 00:33:01,374
Where is he?

491
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,430
Seriously, what are you made of?

492
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,859
Where's Waqar?

493
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,431
What'd Gulrez say?

494
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:11,083
Nothing.

495
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:16,691
He just took me to the beach and asked me to forget that he ever loved Maheen.

496
00:34:17,112 --> 00:34:20,583
'Loved'? I asked him.

497
00:34:20,645 --> 00:34:22,893
He didn't say anything.

498
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,558
Then he took me shopping.

499
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,339
Said I'd have to wear the sherwani he picked.

500
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,689
Shoes, shirt, sherwani... He got me everything.

501
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:40,029
And guess what, he said he's proving he's no Scrooge. He just spends wisely.

502
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,870
He got me the most expensive things he could find.

503
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,583
So sweet of him.

504
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:49,482
Do you know who's putting up the most lively dance upstairs?

505
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,049
Gulrez?

506
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,658
Hey!

507
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,928
I thought he said he couldn't dance!

508
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:59,259
You gotta see his belly dance! The filly!

509
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,038
Don't you pity him?

510
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,428
A bit.

511
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:12,838
I do too.

512
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,119
But I feel that love is selfish.

513
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:18,459
Very selfish.

514
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,099
My love can make me do anything...

515
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,832
Except give my Maheen to Gulrez.

516
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:32,783
Would you pick fights with me after we're married?

517
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:35,184
I wouldn't mind that. Just...

518
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,605
Just don't slap me, okay?

519
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,010
I'm not the kind who'd slap...

520
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,170
That was just -- you might've been arrested!

521
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,648
Shut up!

522
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:47,710
Anyway. Forget the slap.

523
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,279
How can I?

524
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,450
You gave me a scar right here!

525
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,763
Can't we talk about something else?

526
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,039
Ever said sorry?

527
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,690
Twice!

528
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,354
I want you

529
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,090
To keep saying sorry

530
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,136
As long as I live.

531
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,191
Okay.

532
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,218
I'll say sorry as long as I live.

533
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,539
Okay?

534
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,648
Sorry.

535
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,850
What's up?

536
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,391
W -- What? We were just -- You know -- Havin' a chat?

537
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:26,887
I'm growing old waiting for one of you to say 'I love you'!

538
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,958
Say it, will you,

539
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,589
Waqar?

540
00:36:36,649 --> 00:36:39,250
I really want to hear the three magical words!

541
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,128
There goes your chance.

542
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,880
I'll say it for everyone to hear on the wedding day.

543
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,840
You have my word.

544
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
