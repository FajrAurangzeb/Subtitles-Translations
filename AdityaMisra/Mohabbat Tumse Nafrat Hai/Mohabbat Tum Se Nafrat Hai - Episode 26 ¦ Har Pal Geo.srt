00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:17,309
I take right now, you twit.

15
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,559
Would you rather

16
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:28,469
Kill me by giving me the wrong pills now that I've signed the will?

17
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,704
There, now...

18
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:42,134
Enough.

19
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:44,157
I was just kidding...

20
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,757
I know

21
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,901
That you love me so much.

22
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,168
But, my dear,

23
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,736
Mum and Dad have to go someday...

24
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:05,732
And it's better this way.

25
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:10,665
Just pray

26
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,054
That no parent

27
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:19,784
Ever live to witness the death of a child,

28
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,730
Or the poor souls

29
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,903
Would have to die twice.

30
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,929
There, now!

31
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,011
The little twit's crying!

32
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:46,039
Don't worry.

33
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,662
I'm fine.

34
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,724
I was just

35
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,572
Missing Mashood Ahmed a bit.

36
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,469
I thought

37
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:01,774
I'd fool around with you.

38
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,555
But it is wrong to remember him, too, Dastoor Ahmed,

39
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,624
For that London tramp comes to mind, too.

40
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:18,524
Just like that.

41
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,641
Listen...

42
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,684
Yes?

43
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,831
Ever felt

44
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,100
That I find some excuse or the other to remember <i>him</i>?

45
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,875
Tell me honestly.

46
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,346
Or

47
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,590
Do I just feel so

48
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,165
Because that twerp is here?

49
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:51,167
Hasn't he left yet?

50
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,647
No.

51
00:05:53,254 --> 00:05:55,825
He'd leave in a couple of days.

52
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,337
Oh?

53
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:02,046
How do you know?

54
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,555
Have you met him? Ties of blood got the better of you?

55
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,413
No, Ammi Begum, I haven't met him.

56
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,845
I got word.

57
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:16,523
He's staying at the farmhouse.

58
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,505
Munshi Alam's looking after him.

59
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,695
It kills me to hear.

60
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:27,046
Would you look at what Munshi Alam's turned out to be?

61
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,898
As if he'd have the guts to say a word!

62
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,725
Alright, tell me,

63
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:44,356
Is that farmhouse his,

64
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,184
As per the will?

65
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:49,574
Aye.

66
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,939
What's it to us, then? He may stay there or leave...

67
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,471
And you...

68
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,359
Give me the pill.

69
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,506
The yellow one.

70
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,360
'Yellow' is an English word, Ammi Begum.

71
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,517
I know.

72
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,070
Let's just say

73
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,099
The sick are excused for speaking it.

74
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,324
Now,

75
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,703
I even say things like

76
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:25,202
'Blood pressure' and 'temperature'.

77
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,085
Seeing Maheen smile today, I knew <i>he</i> was coming.

78
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,813
Call him inside.

79
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,090
Come in.

80
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,856
He's here to see you.

81
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,784
Who?

82
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,756
Who could it be

83
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,477
But the one

84
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:09,832
Whose coming makes the cacti in Nano's lawn blossom,

85
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:17,123
And brings a smile to your face?

86
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,669
Waqar?

87
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,284
Waqar?

I saw the cacti eight days ago.

98
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:53,069
They were blossoming.

99
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:04,186
This time, they're so colourful!

100
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,999
Oh, the pinks, the blues, the yellows!

101
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,848
And you're here today?

102
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:16,487
Come.

103
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,907
Sit.

104
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,143
Where'd you jet off to this time?

105
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,252
Surely, you weren't in London!

106
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,597
France.

107
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,758
And that noisy old dame was looking for you in London!

108
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:42,282
Who?

109
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:44,682
My Nano, of course.

110
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,548
Your Dado.

111
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,350
You're officially un clochard parisien (a Paris tramp) now, Waqar Ahmed!

112
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,353
What'd happened to Gulrez?

113
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,515
Blood cancer.

114
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,139
By the time we found out,

115
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:31,004
The night had almost fallen.

116
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,707
Night -- ?

117
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,121
You moron!

118
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,393
The sun had almost set.

119
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,645
Would you like some tea?

120
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,106
Neelam...

121
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,385
What's up with you?

122
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,856
Whatever he may be like, whatever he's done...

123
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:33,260
He may be bad for others, but he cleared the way for Gulrez.

124
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,396
But nobody listened to his side of the story.

125
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,386
We'll ask him now that he's come -

126
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,953
'Why'd you leave, mate'?

127
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm afraid of him.

128
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:02,579
I'm more afraid of Maheen.

129
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,291
Why are you here?

130
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,894
I mean, why now,

131
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:21,228
After eight long years?

132
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,409
Maheen, I didn't know...

133
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,849
That Gulrez's left us.

134
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,061
Gulrez left <i>us</i>.

135
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,379
Where do <i>you</i> come in?

136
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:47,800
He'd started auguring in his last days.

137
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:49,788
He'd say,

138
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,072
'He'd come one day'

139
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,588
'With tears in his eyes',

140
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,270
'Regret on his face',

141
00:15:57,672 --> 00:16:00,881
'And the proof of his innocence in his hands'.

142
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,375
Where's your proof?

143
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,164
Wait, Maheen.

144
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:12,430
I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief.

145
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,788
Did you visit his grave?

146
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,630
Aye.

147
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,890
Just today, in fact.

148
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,900
It's been four years since he died.

149
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:35,071
For four years,

150
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,766
The sorrow of his death has been coursing in our veins.

151
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,577
For four years, we've been waiting for the next death.

152
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:51,034
And you say, 'Wait, Maheen',

153
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:54,629
'I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief'?

154
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,314
Is your grief so little, Waqar Ahmed?

155
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,239
You'd be delighted to hear the next thing I say.

156
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,724
For four years, I've been waiting for you, too.

157
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,093
So, where's that twit, Wali?

158
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,233
Ask him to beat him with his boots and throw him out!

159
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:19,795
Wali says that he hasn't wronged us.

160
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,624
He'd cleared the way for our sake.

161
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,030
Wali's got a point.

162
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,301
That wretch has just wronged me.

163
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,706
He's got a point.

164
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:41,851
That wretch has just wronged me.

165
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,490
Brought your proof?

166
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,410
Aye.

167
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,251
I've got your diary

168
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,519
In which you'd poured your heart out.

169
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:16,630
I read it that day.

170
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:22,834
I've read it over and over so many times in eight years that I know it by heart.

171
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,181
I mumble its words in my loneliness...

172
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,831
I thought you only <i>said</i> you were my enemy, Maheen,

173
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,390
But you were <i>actually</i> my enemy all along.

174
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,280
So, I was delighted to hear that you got married to Gulrez.

175
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,670
That's why I lay in France for eight years.

176
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,009
I thought I'd pay a visit

177
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,963
When you'd look at me and say,

178
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,960
'Hey! That's Waqar Ahmed'!

179
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,620
'My cousin...'

180
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,811
'My Uncle's son'.

181
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,240
But I made just one mistake.

182
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,711
What?

183
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,770
I couldn't stand my ground against you, Maheen.

184
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,870
It occurred to me that I defeat you,

185
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,340
But my victory

186
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,480
Would mean poor Gulrez's defeat.

187
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,670
So, I cleared the way for him.

188
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,139
No, Waqar Ahmed.

189
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,737
You left me defeated.

190
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,770
I'd suffered a bitter defeat.

191
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,380
I'd fallen face-first before everyone.

192
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,580
I stopped breathing...

193
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,960
My heart stopped beating...

194
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,011
My head bowed...

195
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:20,403
And everyone felt such pity that they teared up.

196
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,560
And all along, you, with a diary by your side, thought,

197
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,290
That you've ensured my victory as you left.

198
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,931
Come with me.

199
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,389
You say you read my diary,

200
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,969
And took it with you to France.

201
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,840
So, which diary could this be?

202
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,881
Who could've written this one?

203
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:25,171
And if this is my diary,

204
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,140
Who could've written that one?

205
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,089
But I've got the diary with me.

206
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,516
<i>I</i>'ve got the diary with <i>me</i>, Waqar Ahmed.

207
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,119
And if I'd lost this diary,

208
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,150
If you'd taken this diary with you to France,

209
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,830
I would've followed you to France.

210
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I would've grabbed your collar

211
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,600
Right in the middle of a Paris street,

212
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,060
Given you a proper scolding,

213
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,370
And spat in your face.

214
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,229
I've got the diary in my car.

215
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,880
I'll go get it.

216
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,490
He's brought a diary, Nano.

217
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,970
Just like Maheen's.

218
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:02,090
What's there in it?

219
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:05,130
One'd know if one's read it...

220
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,580
Then, go and see what's written in it.

221
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,150
You tell everything like a news bulletin.

222
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:18,682
You skip what's <i>really</i> going on.

223
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,449
He's leaving, Nano...

224
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,950
Another news?

225
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,592
He hasn't got the diary with him.

226
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:31,010
He would've given it to Maheen. Go.

227
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,341
Find out what's written in that diary

228
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,362
And why that twit took something like that from him.

229
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,960
Dastoor!

230
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,652
Dastoor! Come here. My heart grows restless...

231
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,340
Dastoor Ahmed...

232
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,609
What's written in this diary?

233
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,593
How did he get this?

234
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,590
They look the same!

235
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,740
The handwriting looks the same, too.

236
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,001
What do you mean?

237
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,180
Someone's written in a diary like mine

238
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,979
In a handwriting like mine,

239
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:19,006
But he's written what he wanted -

240
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,700
There's dark

241
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,410
Where there was day,

242
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,222
There's a heart poured out

243
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,640
Where there was nothing to say;

244
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,300
There's verve

245
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,163
Where there was vexation,

246
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,739
And there's woe

247
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,230
Where there was delectation.

248
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,094
What about where you'd written Waqar?

249
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,290
He's written whatever he wanted to...

250
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
It was a worse enemy than Waqar

251
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,841
Who'd stabbed me in the back.

252
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,512
I've been betrayed, Munshi Alam.

253
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,670
Think again.

254
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:57,809
Have you been betrayed,

255
00:29:57,924 --> 00:30:00,305
Or those at Kaneez Mahal?

256
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:05,645
There's a diary just like Maheen's.

257
00:30:07,785 --> 00:30:10,234
The handwriting's the same, too.

258
00:30:12,695 --> 00:30:16,715
But the words are not Maheen's.

259
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,395
So,

260
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,583
You read the diary that day, too!

261
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,839
The one you show about as proof.

262
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,879
Just read that diary.

263
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,849
You, too, would feel that Maheen doesn't love me.

264
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,725
It was you

265
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:43,649
Who didn't love her, Waqar Ahmed.

266
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,740
It was just whim,

267
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,860
And you can never love

268
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,110
When love's a whim.

269
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,019
If you read that diary, Munshi Alam, you, too, would think that Maheen's written it herself.

270
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,630
I'd heard

271
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,130
That, in love, one can

272
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:10,944
Read their faces,

273
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,540
And look into their hearts

274
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,521
Through

275
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,320
Their eyes,

276
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,889
And believe them,

277
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,609
Have faith.

278
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,290
I'd never heard

279
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,671
That one could read their diary

280
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:40,481
And take it along as 'proof'!

281
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,580
Where'd you go?

282
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,730
To Maheen's.

283
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,829
With

284
00:31:56,949 --> 00:32:00,360
The 'proof' of your innocence,

285
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,749
Or, rather,

286
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:11,519
To show, after eight long years

287
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,070
And fifteen days,

288
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,830
How Maheen had been at fault?

289
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:38,540
Up there on the writing table is Maheen's diary.

290
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,311
I think

291
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:41,761
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

292
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,100
Don't go anywhere, Waqar...

293
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,090
For my sake...

294
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,152
So,

295
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:12,950
You want to get out of her life somehow, innit?

296
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,510
Then, just marry me.

297
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,580
When you've decided to sacrifice yourself,

298
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,701
Why not give me your pelt?

299
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,340
Good evening, sir.

300
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,100
Good evening.

301
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,512
Is Mlle Jiya home?

302
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,951
She's at her father's place.

303
00:34:58,575 --> 00:34:59,621
Father's?

304
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,052
Aye, M. Mir Mehtab.

305
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:03,772
Alright.

306
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:05,712
I don't have his address.

307
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,081
But it's important that I meet him

308
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,662
Right now.

309
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,372
Just a moment. I'll give you his address.

310
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,970
Oui?

311
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,520
Monsieur,

312
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,821
A M. Waqar's here to meet you.

313
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,465
Waqar...?

314
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,630
Oui...

315
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,601
Send him in.

316
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,980
Bonsoir.

317
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,480
Bonsoir.

318
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,020
I'm seeing you for the first time, but I know you.

319
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,180
I know you, too.

320
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,070
Come.

321
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,560
She's awake, isn't she?

322
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,661
No problem

323
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,941
If she isn't, either.

324
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,780
Come in.

325
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
