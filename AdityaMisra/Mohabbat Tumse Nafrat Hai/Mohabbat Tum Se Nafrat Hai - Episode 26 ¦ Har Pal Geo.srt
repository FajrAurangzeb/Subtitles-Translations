1
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,884
Don't let go...

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,521
I'd die if you did...

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:44,352
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

4
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:58,300
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:07,350
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

6
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:17,095
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

7
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:31,670
<i>In the tale of love</i>

8
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:46,486
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:59,619
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

10
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:29,198
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

11
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,356
This is not the one

12
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:18,033
I take right now, you twit.

13
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,847
Would you rather

14
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:29,370
Kill me by giving me the wrong pills now that I've signed the will?

15
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,022
There, now...

16
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:42,450
Enough.

17
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,766
Leave it be.

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,180
I know

19
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,955
That you love me so much.

20
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,380
But, my dear,

21
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,795
Mum and Dad have to go someday...

22
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:06,532
And it's better this way.

23
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:12,550
Just pray

24
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,271
That no parent

25
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:22,580
Ever live to witness the death of a child,

26
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,923
Or else, the poor souls

27
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:28,651
Would have to die twice.

28
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:33,050
There, now!

29
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:38,613
The little twit's crying!

30
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,612
Don't worry.

31
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,990
I'm fine.

32
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,020
I was just

33
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,233
Missing Mashood Ahmed a bit.

34
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,788
I thought

35
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:02,692
I'd fool around with you.

36
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,070
But it is wrong to remember him, too, Dastoor Ahmed,

37
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,790
For that Londoner tramp comes to mind, too.

38
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,042
Just like that.

39
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,175
Listen...

40
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,983
Yes?

41
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,352
Ever felt

42
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:34,871
That I find some excuse or the other to remember <i>him</i>?

43
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,262
Tell me honestly.

44
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,980
Or

45
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,906
Do I just feel so

46
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:47,762
Because that twerp is here?

47
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,463
Hasn't he left yet?

48
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,977
No.

49
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:56,360
He'd leave in a couple of days.

50
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:58,657
Oh?

51
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:02,701
How do you know?

52
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:07,850
Have you met him? Ties of blood got the better of you?

53
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,710
No, Ammi Begum, I haven't met him.

54
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,449
I got word.

55
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,820
He's staying at the farmhouse.

56
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,850
Munshi Alam's looking after him.

57
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,030
It kills me to hear.

58
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,473
Would you look at what Munshi Alam's turned out to be?

59
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,548
As if he'd have the guts to say a word!

60
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,980
Alright, tell me,

61
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,750
Is that farmhouse his,

62
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,938
As per the will?

63
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:49,859
Yes.

64
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,505
What's it to us, then? He may stay there or leave...

65
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,928
And you...

66
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:01,712
Give me the pill.

67
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,805
The yellow one.

68
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,540
'Yellow' is an English word, Ammi Begum.

69
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,980
I know.

70
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,540
Just think

71
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,738
That the sick are excused for speaking it.

72
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:19,307
Now,

73
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,279
I even say things like

74
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,815
'Blood pressure' and 'temperature'.

75
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,833
Seeing Maheen smile today, I knew that <i>he</i> was coming.

76
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,069
Call him inside.

77
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,414
Come in.

78
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,420
He's here to meet you.

79
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,060
Who?

80
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,018
Who could it be

81
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,340
But the one

82
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:14,200
Whose coming makes the cacti in Nano's lawn blossom,

83
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,314
And brings a smile to your face?

84
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,790
Waqar?

85
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,705
Waqar?
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

86
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:39,914
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

87
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:51,245
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

88
00:10:51,245 --> 00:11:00,597
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

89
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:10,029
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

90
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:19,020
<i>Quaff the blood out of me...</i>

91
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,710
How are you, partner?

92
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,869
How are you, partner?
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

93
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:39,698
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

94
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:48,674
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

95
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,262
I'd seen the cacti eight days ago.

96
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,355
They were blossoming.

97
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,385
This time, they're so colourful!

98
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:07,878
Oh, the pinks, the blues, the yellows!

99
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,195
And you're here today?

100
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,739
Come.

101
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:18,538
Sit.

102
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,346
Where'd you go off to this time?

103
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,610
Surely, you weren't in London!

104
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,216
France.

105
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,060
And that noisy old dame was looking for you in London!

106
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,611
Who?

107
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,944
My Nano, of course.

108
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,121
Your Dado.

109
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,205
You're officially a Parisian tramp now, Waqar Ahmed!

110
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,326
What'd happened to Gulrez?

111
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,016
Blood cancer.

112
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,050
By the time we found out,

113
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,210
The night had almost fallen.

114
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,290
Night --?

115
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,298
You moron!

116
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,985
The sun had almost set.

117
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,971
Would you like some tea?

118
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,510
Neelam...

119
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,062
What's up with you?

120
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,040
Whatever he may be like, whatever he's done...

121
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,820
He may be bad for others, but he'd cleared the way for Gulrez.

122
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,180
But nobody listened to his side of the story.

123
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,907
We'll ask him now that he's come -

124
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,640
'Why did you leave, mate'?

125
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:57,568
I'm afraid of him.

126
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,351
I'm more afraid of Maheen.

127
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,779
Why are you here?

128
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:19,296
I mean, why now,

129
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,915
After eight long years?

130
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,737
Maheen, I didn't know...

131
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:38,050
That Gulrez's left us.

132
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,114
Gulrez left <i>us</i>.

133
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:44,498
How do <i>you</i> fit in?

134
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:48,432
He'd started auguring in his last days.

135
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:50,278
He'd say,

136
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,500
'He'd come one day'

137
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,980
'With tears in his eyes',

138
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,950
'Regret on his face',

139
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,020
'And the proof of his innocence in his hands'.

140
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,549
Where's your proof?

141
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,132
Wait, Maheen.

142
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:12,895
I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief.

143
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,685
Have you visited his grave?

144
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,858
Yes.

145
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,056
Just today, in fact.

146
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,642
It's been four years since he died.

147
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,393
For four years,

148
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:39,650
The sorrow of his death has been coursing in our veins.

149
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,507
For four years, we've been waiting for the next death.

150
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,305
And you say, 'Wait, Maheen',

151
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:55,500
'I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief'?

152
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,275
Is your grief so little, Waqar Ahmed?

153
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,576
You'd be delighted to hear the next thing I say.

154
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,798
For four years, I've been waiting for you, too.

155
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,312
So, where's that twit, Wali?

156
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:16,494
Ask him to beat him with his boots and throw him out!

157
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:20,530
Wali says that he hasn't wronged us.

158
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:25,055
He'd cleared the way for our sake.

159
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,816
Wali's got a point.

160
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,950
That wretch has just wronged me.

161
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,252
He's got a point.

162
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,568
That wretch has just wronged me.

163
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,868
Brought your proof?

164
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,628
Yes.

165
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:08,240
I've got your diary

166
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,261
In which you'd poured your heart out.

167
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,550
I'd read it that day.

168
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:23,262
I've read it over and over so many times in eight years that I know it by heart.

169
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,017
I mumble its words in my loneliness...

170
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:39,300
I'd thought that you only <i>said</i> you were my enemy, Maheen,

171
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,350
But you were <i>actually</i> my enemy all along.

172
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:50,941
So, I was delighted to hear that you'd gotten married to Gulrez.

173
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,760
That's why I lay in France for eight years.

174
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:01,178
I thought I'd pay a visit

175
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,164
When you'd look at me and say,

176
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:05,252
'Hey! That's Waqar Ahmed'!

177
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,051
'My cousin...'

178
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,478
'My Uncle's son'.

179
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:15,092
But I made just one mistake.

180
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:16,986
What?

181
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,380
I couldn't stand my ground against you, Maheen.

182
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,006
It occurred to me that I defeat you,

183
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:35,790
But my victory

184
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,515
Would mean poor Gulrez's defeat.

185
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,246
So, I cleared the way for him.

186
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,544
No, Waqar Ahmed.

187
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:50,673
You'd left me defeated.

188
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,246
I'd suffered a bitter defeat.

189
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,744
I'd fallen face-first before everyone.

190
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,884
I stopped breathing...

191
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,253
My heart stopped beating...

192
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,652
My head bowed...

193
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,062
And everyone felt such pity that they teared up.

194
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,790
And all along, you, with a diary by your side, thought,

195
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,210
That you've ensured my victory as you left.

196
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,354
Come with me.

197
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,180
You say that you'd read my diary,

198
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,793
And took the diary with you to France.

199
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,110
So, which diary could this be?

200
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,406
Who could've written this one?

201
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,877
And if this is my diary,

202
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,938
Who could've written that one?

203
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,690
But I've got the diary with me.

204
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,936
<i>I</i>'ve got the diary with <i>me</i>, Waqar Ahmed.

205
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,650
And if I'd lost this diary,

206
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,034
If you'd taken this diary with you to France,

207
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:04,260
I would've followed you to France.

208
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,772
I would've grabbed your collar

209
00:23:06,772 --> 00:23:11,015
Right in the middle of a Paris street,

210
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,810
Given you a proper scolding,

211
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,864
And spat in your face.

212
00:23:20,436 --> 00:23:23,789
I've got the diary in my car.

213
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,160
I'll go get it.

214
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,760
He's brought a diary, Nano.

215
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,700
Just like Maheen's.

216
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,977
What's there in it?

217
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,330
One'd know if one's read it...

218
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,837
Then, go and see what's written in it.

219
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:15,270
You tell everything like a news bulletin.

220
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,314
You skip what's <i>really</i> going on.

221
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:21,940
He's leaving, Nano...

222
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,277
Another news?

223
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:27,792
He hasn't got the diary with him.

224
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:31,277
He would've given it to Maheen. Go.

225
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:36,200
Find out what's written in that diary

226
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,387
And why that twit took something like that from him.

227
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,059
Dastoor!

228
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:59,199
Dastoor! Come here. My heart grows restless...

229
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,706
Dastoor Ahmed...

230
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,342
What's written in this diary?

231
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,072
How did he get this?

232
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:56,145
They look the same!

233
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:00,321
The handwriting looks the same, too.

234
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,780
What do you mean?

235
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,490
Someone's written in a diary like mine

236
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,609
In a handwriting like mine,

237
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:22,594
But he's written what he wanted -

238
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:26,100
There's dark

239
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,722
Where there was day,

240
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:35,040
There's a heart poured out

241
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,850
Where there was nothing to say;

242
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,512
There's verve

243
00:28:43,512 --> 00:28:48,362
Where there was vexation,

244
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:52,050
And there's woe

245
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,434
Where there was delectation.

246
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:58,468
What about where you'd written Waqar?

247
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,690
He's written whatever he wanted to...

248
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:22,254
It was a worse enemy than Waqar

249
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:25,606
Who'd stabbed me in the back.

250
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,023
I've been betrayed, Munshi Alam.

251
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:53,152
Think again.

252
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:58,125
Have you been betrayed,

253
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:01,117
Or those at Kaneez Mahal?

254
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:06,232
There's a diary just like Maheen's.

255
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,789
The handwriting's the same, too.

256
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:17,040
But the words are not Maheen's.

257
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,878
So,

258
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:22,736
You'd read the diary that day, too!

259
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:28,734
The one you show about as proof.

260
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:32,814
Just read that diary.

261
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:38,097
You, too, would feel that Maheen doesn't love me.

262
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:40,921
It was you

263
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:44,680
Who didn't love her, Waqar Ahmed.

264
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,261
It was just whim,

265
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:52,051
And you can never love

266
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,940
When love's a whim.

267
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,950
If you read that diary, Munshi Alam, you, too, would think that Maheen's written it herself.

268
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,600
I'd heard

269
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,570
That, in love, one can

270
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,660
Read their faces,

271
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,822
And look into their hearts

272
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:20,270
Through

273
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:24,843
Their eyes,

274
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,470
And believe them,

275
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,275
Have faith.

276
00:31:31,077 --> 00:31:32,510
I'd never heard

277
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:35,980
That one could read their diary

278
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,066
And take it along as 'proof'!

279
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:44,949
Where'd you gone?

280
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,994
To Maheen's.

281
00:31:55,339 --> 00:31:57,268
With

282
00:31:57,268 --> 00:32:04,117
The 'proof' of your innocence,

283
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,667
Or, rather,

284
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:13,150
To show, after eight long years

285
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,310
And fifteen days,

286
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,141
How Maheen had been at fault?

287
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,714
Up there on the writing table is Maheen's diary.

288
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:39,500
I think

289
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,487
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

290
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,280
Don't go anywhere, Waqar...

291
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,867
For my sake...

292
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,380
So,

293
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,215
You want to get out of her life somehow, innit?

294
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,976
Then, just marry me.

295
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:18,805
When you've decided to sacrifice yourself,

296
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:22,581
Why not give me your pelt?

297
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,599
Good evening, sir.

298
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,563
Good evening.

299
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,835
Is Mlle Jiya home?

300
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:58,473
She's at her Dad's place.

301
00:34:58,798 --> 00:34:59,784
Dad's?

302
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:02,700
Yes, M. Mir Mehtab.

303
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,010
Alright.

304
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,906
I don't have his address.

305
00:35:05,906 --> 00:35:08,240
But it's important that I meet him

306
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,882
Right now.

307
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:14,070
Just a moment. I'll give you his address.

308
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,157
Yes?

309
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:27,620
Monsieur,

310
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,447
A M. Waqar's here to meet you.

311
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,901
Waqar...?

312
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,821
Oui...

313
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,370
Send him in.

314
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,439
Good evening.

315
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,887
'Evening.

316
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:16,175
I'm seeing you for the first time, but I know you.

317
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,857
I know you, too.

318
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,532
Come.

319
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,864
She's awake, isn't she?

320
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,885
No problem

321
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,736
If she isn't, either.

322
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,000
Come in.

323
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
