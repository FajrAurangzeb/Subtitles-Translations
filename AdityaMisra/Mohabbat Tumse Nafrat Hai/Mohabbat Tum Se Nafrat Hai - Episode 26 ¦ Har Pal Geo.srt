1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let go...

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die if you did...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is not the one

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I take right now, you twit.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you rather

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kill me by giving me the wrong pills now that I've signed the will?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you love me so much.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, my dear,

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and Dad have to go someday...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's better this way.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That no parent

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever live to witness the death of a child,

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or else, the poor souls

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would have to die twice.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The little twit's crying!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm fine.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Missing Mashood Ahmed a bit.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd fool around with you.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it is wrong to remember him, too, Dastoor Ahmed,

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For that Londoner tramp comes to mind, too.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like that.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever felt

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That I find some excuse or the other to remember him?</i>

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me honestly.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I just feel so

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because that twerp is here?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hasn't he left yet?

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd leave in a couple of days.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you know?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you met him? Ties of blood got the better of you?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ammi Begum, I haven't met him.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got word.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's staying at the farmhouse.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam's looking after him.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me to hear.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at what Munshi Alam's turned out to be?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if he'd have the guts to say a word!

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me,

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that farmhouse his,

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As per the will?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to us, then? He may stay there or leave...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me the pill.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The yellow one.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Yellow' is an English word, Ammi Begum.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the sick are excused for speaking it.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now,

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I even say things like

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Blood pressure' and 'temperature'.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Seeing Maheen smile today, I knew that he was coming.</i>

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him inside.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here to meet you.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the one

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose coming makes the cacti in Nano's lawn blossom,

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And brings a smile to your face?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Waqar?
What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me...</i>

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you, partner?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How are you, partner?
Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd seen the cacti eight days ago.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were blossoming.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This time, they're so colourful!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, the pinks, the blues, the yellows!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're here today?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you go off to this time?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, you weren't in London!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
France.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that noisy old dame was looking for you in London!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Nano, of course.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dado.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're officially a Parisian tramp now, Waqar Ahmed!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd happened to Gulrez?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blood cancer.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time we found out,

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The night had almost fallen.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Night --?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You moron!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sun had almost set.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like some tea?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with you?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever he may be like, whatever he's done...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may be bad for others, but he'd cleared the way for Gulrez.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But nobody listened to his side of the story.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll ask him now that he's come -

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Why did you leave, mate'?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid of him.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm more afraid of Maheen.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, why now,

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After eight long years?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, I didn't know...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez's left us.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Gulrez left us.</i>

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>How do you fit in?</i>

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd started auguring in his last days.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd say,

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He'd come one day'

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'With tears in his eyes',

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Regret on his face',

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And the proof of his innocence in his hands'.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your proof?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Maheen.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you visited his grave?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just today, in fact.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been four years since he died.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For four years,

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sorrow of his death has been coursing in our veins.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For four years, we've been waiting for the next death.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you say, 'Wait, Maheen',

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll talk once I'm over Gulrez's grief'?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is your grief so little, Waqar Ahmed?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be delighted to hear the next thing I say.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For four years, I've been waiting for you, too.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, where's that twit, Wali?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him to beat him with his boots and throw him out!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali says that he hasn't wronged us.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd cleared the way for our sake.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali's got a point.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That wretch has just wronged me.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got a point.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That wretch has just wronged me.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brought your proof?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got your diary

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In which you'd poured your heart out.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd read it that day.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've read it over and over so many times in eight years that I know it by heart.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mumble its words in my loneliness...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'd thought that you only said you were my enemy, Maheen,</i>

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you were actually my enemy all along.</i>

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, I was delighted to hear that you'd gotten married to Gulrez.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I lay in France for eight years.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd pay a visit

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you'd look at me and say,

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Hey! That's Waqar Ahmed'!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'My cousin...'

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'My Uncle's son'.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I made just one mistake.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't stand my ground against you, Maheen.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It occurred to me that I defeat you,

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my victory

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would mean poor Gulrez's defeat.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, I cleared the way for him.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar Ahmed.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd left me defeated.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd suffered a bitter defeat.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd fallen face-first before everyone.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I stopped breathing...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart stopped beating...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My head bowed...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And everyone felt such pity that they teared up.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And all along, you, with a diary by your side, thought,

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you've ensured my victory as you left.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say that you'd read my diary,

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And took the diary with you to France.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, which diary could this be?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could've written this one?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if this is my diary,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could've written that one?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've got the diary with me.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I've got the diary with me, Waqar Ahmed.</i>

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if I'd lost this diary,

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you'd taken this diary with you to France,

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've followed you to France.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've grabbed your collar

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right in the middle of a Paris street,

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Given you a proper scolding,

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And spat in your face.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got the diary in my car.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go get it.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's brought a diary, Nano.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like Maheen's.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's there in it?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One'd know if one's read it...

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, go and see what's written in it.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You tell everything like a news bulletin.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You skip what's really going on.</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's leaving, Nano...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another news?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He hasn't got the diary with him.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He would've given it to Maheen. Go.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find out what's written in that diary

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And why that twit took something like that from him.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor! Come here. My heart grows restless...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's written in this diary?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How did he get this?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They look the same!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The handwriting looks the same, too.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's written in a diary like mine

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a handwriting like mine,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he's written what he wanted -

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's dark

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there was day,

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a heart poured out

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there was nothing to say;

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's verve

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there was vexation,

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there's woe

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there was delectation.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about where you'd written Waqar?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's written whatever he wanted to...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was a worse enemy than Waqar

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd stabbed me in the back.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been betrayed, Munshi Alam.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you been betrayed,

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or those at Kaneez Mahal?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a diary just like Maheen's.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The handwriting's the same, too.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the words are not Maheen's.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd read the diary that day, too!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one you show about as proof.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just read that diary.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You, too, would feel that Maheen doesn't love me.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was you

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who didn't love her, Waqar Ahmed.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was just whim,

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you can never love

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When love's a whim.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you read that diary, Munshi Alam, you, too, would think that Maheen's written it herself.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd heard

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That, in love, one can

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read their faces,

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And look into their hearts

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Through

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Their eyes,

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And believe them,

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have faith.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never heard

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That one could read their diary

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take it along as 'proof'!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you gone?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Maheen's.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The 'proof' of your innocence,

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or, rather,

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To show, after eight long years

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And fifteen days,

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How Maheen had been at fault?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Up there on the writing table is Maheen's diary.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go anywhere, Waqar...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my sake...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to get out of her life somehow, innit?

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, just marry me.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you've decided to sacrifice yourself,

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not give me your pelt?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening, sir.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Mlle Jiya home?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's at her Dad's place.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad's?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, M. Mir Mehtab.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have his address.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's important that I meet him

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a moment. I'll give you his address.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monsieur,

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A M. Waqar's here to meet you.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar...?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oui...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send him in.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Evening.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm seeing you for the first time, but I know you.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you, too.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's awake, isn't she?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No problem

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she isn't, either.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
