1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya came here,

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Met neither of us,

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And took Ammi Begum into the room.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who am I?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out in the sun.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit for a while.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehru...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did you start talking like Ammi Begum?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever since I realised

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she says only what's best.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Merci beaucoup.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talked to her as a mother last night.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said,

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You asked for time'.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'It was our fault'

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'That we didn't ask you how long you wanted'.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She looked back, surprised.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She couldn't believe I was saying that!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, she said,

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'About'...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'2 or 4 days'?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't stop there.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'Even if you don't accept',

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't refuse'.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't keep someone waiting so many years just to refuse...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think it's a job well done?

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about him?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one who'll leave me tongue-tied in the doghouse.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take care of him.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A lad spoilt in the West can't be corrected in the East.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if he were ever...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you say it?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Loafer, wastrel, Londoner tramp'!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lie about it.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that no one except Jiya likes him.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, I've even started believing it.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a loafer... A wastrel...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Londoner tramp!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, Ammi Begum?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you lie?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope to keep

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One promise, at the very least...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'm saved from being tongue-tied in the doghouse or from the doghouse if not.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on, Maheen?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It drives me crazy...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen it like this!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Granny doesn't like it when two cousins are making peace.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lad's Aunt didn't let him in when he brought flowers and perfume,

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When everyone's thinking about him,

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he better be married off to someone he doesn't even love!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the devil is going on?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I do know

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it'll be fine if I agreed to marry Gulrez.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have, Fajr.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart doesn't.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fantastic...

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I begin to curse my heart.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, whatever's wrong with Gulrez?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He looks nice,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is of good character,

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does his 9-to-5 job...

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Loves me, too...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've been engaged since we were kids...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the big deal...

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me but I don't like it one bit, Ammi Begum...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum and daughter talk about everything in classified meetings,

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Dastoor's called upon only to hear the decision.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've called you for your advice,

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to order you.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it well enough.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was called for 'advice' the last time as well, but it ended with an order.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you sit,

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or would you rather that I send you out?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why wouldn't I sit?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm someone too, after all!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Orders, ma'am?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehru...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you remember

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What Munshi Alam Deen had said.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd said,

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If he doesn't want to marry Jiya',

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Just prod and ask him'

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Who he wants to marry'.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah, I don't intend to prod...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But go, Dastoor, and ask him today.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure his answer will put you on the rack.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're very angry with me, right?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I didn't obey you?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think I've left you helpless?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Dado...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And as for my respect and regard for you, I can even sacrifice my life for you.
-Cut to the chase...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I say?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been asking myself why I just couldn't obey you.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why can't I just marry Jiya...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've realised today

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I will never marry Jiya.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who, then?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, who do you want to marry?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been so long!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so late?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez wasn't well.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took a pill and went to bed.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was worried about what I'd do alone if things got bad.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you always drink a glass of water...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad used to say...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A mother's heart can also be found in daughters and sisters.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't think any mother would be so motherly as you are.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which is why I'm sometimes afraid of you.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, don't fear me...

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the mother in me.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just speak your heart out.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wouldn't be able to hear it.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a mother, right?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me tell you

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the Lord gives mothers courage unlike any other.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The worry kills me!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed has made it clear that he'll marry Maheen.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So? I mean --

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if Waqar Ahmed's words are a Royal edict

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That must be followed!

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is a Royal edict now.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what we've been fearing.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All of us.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor, Aunt Suraiyya, me...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, most of all, Ammi Begum...

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How hard we've tried that it not come to this!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, in all honesty, no amount of wits and wisdom can change what's willed.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she said she loves no one else!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said everything in it.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't love Gulrez.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

160
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,666
The world's ending, is it?

161
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,683
Had a nightmare?

162
00:14:37,873 --> 00:14:39,062
What, then?

163
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:42,315
The King's gambit, Maheen!

164
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,426
What do you mean?

165
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,615
Who did it?

166
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:46,906
Waqar.

167
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:49,994
That's what you woke me up for?

168
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:51,944
C'mon, now, back to bed!

169
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,773
Not another word about him!

170
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:55,500
As if you can sleep now!

171
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,313
I can!

172
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,634
No need to tell me anything about him.

173
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:03,064
Who he meets, what he does, which gambit he plays -- I want none of it!

174
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:04,731
Really?

175
00:15:05,526 --> 00:15:07,467
As if I'm lying!

176
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,287
I'll take my leave, then!

177
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,094
Please!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's told Nano who he wants to marry.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya, right?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of them French girls?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

183
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,465
You'd die where you stand --

184
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,701
I mean -- where you sit -- if you heard it.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of Nano's maids, is it?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't matter to you, right, who he marries?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should it?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sweet dreams, then.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard your reply.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reply?

191
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,840
What do you mean, Fajr?

192
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,172
Mum's the word!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't gonna remain hidden for long!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Khushi Mohammad will give you the good news in the morning.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh yeah?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask in the morning myself.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'll only marry Maheen Aurangzeb!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the property will be divided tomorrow.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And next week,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll give him his share and send him to London forever.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, Ammi Begum,

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this is no solution.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have a better solution?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to Maheen.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one will talk to Maheen.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll never agree to marry Waqar.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she did?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm her mother, Ammi Begum.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should know, too,

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else I don't know about my daughter!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If there were any such thing, I would've gotten wind of it.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know very well

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she'll create a ruckus over it.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It just can't be!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The girl's interested in someone, and the mother hasn't the foggiest!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can that be?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask Maheen.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you, she'll break his face for real.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you believe me?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember how they looked like mortal enemies?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned for what they have in store...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you worried?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashamed is more like it, Suraiyya...

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Strange

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That, after his parents died,

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's asked his Dado for something for the first time,

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Dado's so helpless

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she can't give him anything except his piffling share.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be enough.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if he's unhappy,

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'll settle for it if he saw his share.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, Mashood Ahmed...

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you left Kaneez Begum to judge this perplexing matter,

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And to judge is to be so heartless

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As to be blind to the grandson's wish...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How families come into being

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And stay together?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it that makes us say firmly, 'These are our traditions',

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And these are not'.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Traditions are not built on casual exchanges of words,

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But by giving your word and honouring promises,

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if it means laying down your life,

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, in the interest of fairness and justice,

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By throttling your own wishes.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what you're here to tell me.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you don't know that it's just a wish.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't insisted that it be fulfilled.

253
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:51,230
Splendid!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a wish!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More like a bombshell you dropped on all of us!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've left many out of breath and many more gasping anxiously.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're here acting like you're innocent!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got a signal from the other side?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Signal?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me that 'signal' means just a signal in London.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The green light, you know. Doesn't it mean something else?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. It's like, 'Go ahead'!

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, ol' chap, did Maheen say, 'Go ahead'?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Uncle... Who knows what you're saying...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told her?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, of course!

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't have the foggiest.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you know?

271
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,929
Turn back before this very instant if you value your life!

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd even say, go and tell Ammi Begum

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you were kidding.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant every bit of it.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if you want that Maheen marry Gulrez,

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no objections.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't challenged the family by telling you my wish,

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor insisted that you change your decisions.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do what you've promised.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another one's desires have been sacrificed on the altar of 'justice'.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hearing you, I figure

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen wants the same.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even want to see my face!

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She --

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just felt if there's anyone I should marry, it's Maheen.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you keep it locked in your heart forever?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where could it go if let out?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't speak a word before her, let alone let my heart talk!

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just helpless feelings, Uncle...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can be chained now...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody hears a word if a kid's strangled the moment he's born.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell Ammi Begum?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anything, really.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please, don't say that I was kidding.

297
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:52,409
Feelings can be locked away...

298
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,831
But not the truth, Uncle.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your tie.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't go to office without one.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not going to office.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to meet Nano.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It --

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would be better if you didn't... For a few days...

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just -- Don't...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you stopping me?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait for Maheen's reply.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why, but I have this feeling that if you went to Nano's,

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd feel that you're there to beg...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never beg.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know that.
-They don't. Maheen doesn't.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what she'll think.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let her.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why must you be so adamant?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had a nightmare last night.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Somewhere, in the eye of the storm...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're shutting the doors and windows...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're waiting

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For Wali...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, there's a knock on the door...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You open the door.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Wali...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ask him to come in quickly,

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And shut the door.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali's quiet...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost unusually...

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shocked...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Distressed...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take out a bottle of cold water from the fridge.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give it to him...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gestures a no...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even though...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He always has a glass when he gets back...

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you heard everything?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd dozed off after taking the pill.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd actually dozed off.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd taken the pill.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough of your theatrics.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You heard everything.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't listen in on you and Wali.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you really had this dream?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on, then.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll tell the rest to Nano.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's why you're going...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to tell her I won't marry Maheen.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What rubbish!
-Not rubbish...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw that you

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Were very worried.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sister's mask had fallen off your face...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Revealing every bit of the mother.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The mother worried by every cough of her child...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you become?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I won't be the kid

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd ask his Mum for the moon to play with.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want the moonlight.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he say?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he wants to get even with you.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He might've been joking.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd joke about marrying me?

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just ask him.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may be serious.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll feed him his teeth!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you ought to do.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feed him his teeth!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do what I say, Mum.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah,

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're waiting to finish breakfast, eh?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any idea what she'd do?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just what she ought to.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, finish your breakfast.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Uncle Munshi.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello there.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give the phone to Ali.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's gone to school, Fajr.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who goes to school on Doomsday?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got a helmet?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Helmet?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find one, Uncle, pronto!

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do with one?

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find one and give it to Waqar. Quick!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he...

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asked for one?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a gift from me!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning, Uncle Munshi.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Morning.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Nano?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In her room.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't come out very much these days.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, blimey, mate, it's been two months since I'm here, and we're meeting for the second time today!

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The third. Not the second.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We did.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last night, I met you in my dream...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good one.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not a joke, Waqar.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although it is like one.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't need to meet those we want to meet.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We meet those we think of.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, I've got to meet Nano,

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't meet her in my dreams.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd have to ask for her permission

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even to meet her in my dreams.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's in her room.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's me, Nano.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in, my dear.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here to meet me?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Nano.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Skiving off work, eh?

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just did...

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did that happen?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen you

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Skive off work.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something's changed, Nano...

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say great men aren't bound by habits and rules.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Their habits keep changing,

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As do their rules.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard the same, too.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd become a great man

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By skiving off work?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should do something

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That shows everyone

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez means business.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you up to?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had a dream...

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bolt from the blue...

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bolt, eh, dear?

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm already in the middle of a thunderstorm.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better do something

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That gets me out of it.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is just what I'm here for.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The dream was a sign...

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honest, Nano.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw an old man with a long white beard.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said,

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'There's two kinds of lovers'.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'One, le peintre, working on his masterpiece of love'...

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Painter'!

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes...

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Painter'...

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the other?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And two, the kind who buy masterpieces to adorn their walls with'.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, which one

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you be?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Certes, not the one

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd buy a painting to adorn my wall with...

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do?

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd just paint my masterpiece.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm done with it now.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My story ends there.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd adorn his wall with your painting?

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
