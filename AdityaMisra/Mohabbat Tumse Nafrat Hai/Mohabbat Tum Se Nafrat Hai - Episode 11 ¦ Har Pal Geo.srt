1
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,437
What's up?

2
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:26,097
What?

3
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,817
Suraiyya came here,

4
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:30,557
Met neither of us,

5
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:33,417
And took Ammi Begum into the room.

6
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:35,713
Who am I?

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,548
Come.

8
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:39,841
Where?

9
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,328
Out in the sun.

10
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:43,048
Sit for a while.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,631
Mehru...

12
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:47,871
When did you start talking like Ammi Begum?

13
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,170
Ever since I realised

14
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,559
That she says only what's best.

15
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:56,197
Merci beaucoup.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,456
I talked to her as a mother last night.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,960
I said,

18
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,226
'You asked for time'.

19
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,545
'It was our fault'

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,870
'That we didn't ask you how long you wanted'.

21
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,306
She looked back, surprised.

22
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,000
She couldn't believe <i>I</i> was saying that!

23
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:42,507
Then, she said,

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,586
'About'...

25
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,977
'2 or 4 days'?

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,309
I didn't stop there.

27
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:53,260
I said, 'Even if you don't accept',

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,261
'Don't refuse'.

29
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,400
Don't keep someone waiting so many years just to refuse...

30
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,040
Don't you think it's a job well done?

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,621
What about <i>him</i>?

32
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:13,122
Who?

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,417
The one

34
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:21,578
Who'll leave me tongue-tied in the doghouse.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,178
You take care of him.

36
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,768
A lad spoilt in the West can't be corrected in the East.

37
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,380
As if he were ever...

38
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,477
Don't you say it?

39
00:02:38,477 --> 00:02:41,545
'Loafer, wastrel, London tramp'!

40
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,861
I lie about it.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,031
So that no one

42
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,888
Except Jiya likes him.

43
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,298
But you can only lie for so long before you start believing it yourself...

44
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:01,778
I've begun to think... He's a loafer... A wastrel...

45
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,437
The London tramp!

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,097
Why, Ammi Begum?

47
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,647
Why do you lie?

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,991
I hope to keep

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,097
One promise, at the very least...

50
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,888
That I'm saved from being tongue-tied in the doghouse or from the doghouse if not.

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,828
What's going on, Maheen?

52
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:45,838
It drives me crazy...

53
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,158
I've never seen it like this!

54
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:52,670
The Granny doesn't like it when two cousins are making peace.

55
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,861
The lad's Aunt didn't let him in when he brought flowers and perfume,

56
00:03:58,011 --> 00:04:01,040
When everyone's thinking about him,

57
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,118
That he better be married off to someone he doesn't even love!

58
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:07,029
What the devil is going on?

59
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:09,438
No idea.

60
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,070
But I do know

61
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,407
That it'll be fine if I agreed to marry Gulrez.

62
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:15,850
Why don't you?

63
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,789
I have, Fajr.

64
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:19,740
But my heart doesn't.

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,169
Spiffing!

66
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,899
Sometimes, I begin to curse my heart.

67
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,539
I mean, whatever's wrong with Gulrez?

68
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,099
He looks nice,

69
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:32,512
Is of good character,

70
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,169
Does his 9-to-5 job...

71
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,900
Loves me, too...

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,481
And...

73
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:40,002
We've been engaged since we were kids...

74
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:42,923
What's the big deal...

75
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:45,094
What?

76
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,298
No idea...

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,148
Forgive me but I don't like it one bit, Ammi Begum...

78
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:25,501
Mum and daughter talk about everything in classified meetings,

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,950
And Dastoor's called upon only to hear the decision.

80
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,862
Put a sock in it...

81
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:33,883
I've called you for your advice,

82
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,884
Not to order you.

83
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,377
Leave it be.

84
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,185
I know it well enough.

85
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:46,504
I was called for 'advice' the last time as well, but it ended with an order.

86
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,908
Would you sit,

87
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,514
Or would you rather that I send you out?

88
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,795
Why wouldn't I sit?

89
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,684
I'm someone too, after all!

90
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,708
Orders, ma'am?

91
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,928
Mehru...

92
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,101
I hope you remember

93
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,871
What Munshi Alam Deen had said.

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,011
I do.

95
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,249
He'd said,

96
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,639
'If he doesn't want to marry Jiya',

97
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,410
'Just prod and ask him'

98
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,860
'Who he'd rather marry'.

99
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,664
Naw, I don't intend to prod...

100
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:35,628
But go, Dastoor, and ask him today.

101
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,878
I'm sure his answer will put you on the rack.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,149
You're very angry with me, yes?

103
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,947
Because I didn't obey you?

104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,968
You think I've left you helpless?

105
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,457
No, Dado...

106
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:13,590
As for my respect and regard for you, I can sacrifice my life for you.

107
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,789
Cut to the chase...

108
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:19,900
What do I say?

109
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,667
I've been asking myself why I just couldn't obey you.

110
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,998
Why I just can't marry Jiya...

111
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,961
But I've realised today

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,078
That I will never marry Jiya.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,018
Who, then?

114
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Aye, who'd you rather marry? I want a name!

115
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,052
Maheen.

116
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,976
It's been so long!

117
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,417
Why are you so late?

118
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,438
Gulrez wasn't well.

119
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:22,776
He took a pill and went to bed.

120
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:29,921
I was worried about what I'd do alone if things got bad.

121
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,867
No...

122
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,780
But you always drink a glass of water...

123
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,987
First thing you get back...

124
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,767
What are you looking at?

125
00:09:49,825 --> 00:09:51,377
What happened?

126
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,310
Sit.

127
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,724
Dad used to say...

128
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:19,368
A mother's heart can also be found in daughters and sisters.

129
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,611
But I don't think any mother

130
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,957
Would be so motherly as you.

131
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,109
So?

132
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:33,389
Which is why I'm sometimes afraid of you.

133
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,947
Please, don't fear me...

134
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,905
Or the mother in me.

135
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,938
Just speak your heart out.

136
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:49,528
You wouldn't be able to hear it.

137
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,966
I'm a mother, yes?

138
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,718
Let me tell you

139
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,198
That the Lord gives mothers courage unlike any other.

140
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,540
C'mon!

141
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:13,319
The worry kills me!

142
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,948
Waqar Ahmed has made it clear that he'll marry Maheen.

143
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,810
So?

144
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,965
I mean --

145
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,507
As if Waqar Ahmed's words are a Royal edict

146
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,867
That must be followed!

147
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,487
Aye.

148
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,749
It <i>is</i> a Royal edict now.

149
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,409
That's what we've been fearing.

150
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,413
We?

151
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:51,850
All of us.

152
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,898
Uncle Dastoor, Aunt Suraiyya, me...

153
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,538
And, most of all, Ammi Begum...

154
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,686
We've tried our best to make sure it never comes to this...

155
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:04,269
But, in all honesty,

156
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,960
No amount of wits and wisdom can change

157
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,620
What's willed.

158
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,177
But she said she loves no one else!

159
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,628
She spoke her heart out then.

160
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,159
She doesn't love Gulrez.

161
00:12:45,080 --> 00:13:00,580

00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,095
Had a nightmare?

170
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,048
What, then?

171
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,592
The King's gambit, Maheen!

172
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,002
What do you mean?

173
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:45,310
Who played it?

174
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,928
Waqar.

175
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,718
That's what you woke me up for?

176
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:51,368
C'mon, now, back to bed!

177
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,538
Not another word about him!

178
00:14:53,538 --> 00:14:55,168
As if you can sleep now!

179
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:56,128
I can!

180
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,377
No need to tell me anything about him.

181
00:14:58,377 --> 00:15:02,780
Who he meets, what he does, which gambit he plays -- I want none of it!

182
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,336
Really?

183
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,220
Do I look like I'm lying?

184
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,131
I'll take my leave, then!

185
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:10,812
Please!

186
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,800
He told Nano who he wants to marry.

187
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,018
Hey!

188
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,507
Jiya?

189
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,731
One of 'em French girls?

190
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,348
Who?

191
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,210
You'd die where you stand --

192
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,808
I mean -- where you sit -- if you heard it.

193
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,807
One of Nano's maids, is it?

194
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,928
It doesn't matter to you, right, who he marries?

195
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,198
Why should it?

196
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,698
Sweet dreams, then.

197
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:00,638
I've heard your reply.

198
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,491
<i>My</i> reply?

199
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:04,571
What do you mean, Fajr?

200
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,027
Mum's the word! It ain't gonna remain hidden for long!

201
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:09,868
Khushi Mohammad will give you the good news in the morning.

202
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,837
Oh yeah?

203
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,288
I'll ask him in the morning myself.

204
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,868
He said

205
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,967
That he'll only marry Maheen Aurangzeb!

206
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,487
I've decided...

207
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,698
That the property will be divided tomorrow.

208
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,088
And next week,

209
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:05,638
We'll give him his share and send him to London forever.

210
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,788
Forgive me, Ammi Begum,

211
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,738
But this is no solution.

212
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,971
Do you have a better solution?

213
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,448
I'll talk to Maheen.

214
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,618
No one will talk to Maheen.

215
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,128
She'll never agree to marry Waqar.

216
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:39,380
What if she did?

217
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,818
Aye?

218
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,978
I'm her mother, Ammi Begum.

219
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,288
I should know, too,

220
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,028
What else I don't know about my daughter!

221
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,052
If there were any such thing, I would've gotten wind of it.

222
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,838
I know very well

223
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,801
She'll create a ruckus over it.

224
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,320
It just can't be!

225
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:13,599
The girl's interested in someone, and the mother hasn't the foggiest!

226
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,872
How can that be?

227
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,618
I'll ask Maheen.

228
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,877
I tell you, she'll break his face for real.

229
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,818
What are you looking at?

230
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:33,819
Don't you

231
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:36,539
Believe me?

232
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,128
Remember how they looked like mortal enemies?

233
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:44,429
Now...

234
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,668
Stay tuned for what they have in store...

235
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:53,338
Are you worried?

236
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,898
Ashamed is more like it, Suraiyya...

237
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:01,109
Strange

238
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:05,743
That, after his parents died,

239
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,490
He's asked his Dado for something for the first time,

240
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,019
And Dado's so helpless

241
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:21,836
That she can't give him anything except his piffling share.

242
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,619
It'll be enough.

243
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,178
Even if he's unhappy,

244
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:33,650
I'm sure he'll settle for it if he saw his share.

245
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,958
Forgive me, Mashood Ahmed...

246
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,708
But you left Kaneez Begum to judge this perplexing matter,

247
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,367
And to judge is to be so heartless

248
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,329
As to be blind to the grandson's wish...

249
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,898
Ever thought

250
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,368
How families come into being

251
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,243
And stay together?

252
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,848
What is it that makes us say firmly, 'These are our traditions',

253
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,869
'And these are not'.

254
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:23,938
Traditions are not built on casual exchanges of words,

255
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:28,160
But by giving your word and honouring promises,

256
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,061
Even if it means laying down your life,

257
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,558
And, in the interest of fairness and justice,

258
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,612
By throttling your own wishes.

259
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,405
I know what you're here to tell me.

260
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,720
But you don't know that it's just a wish.

261
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,198
I haven't insisted that it be fulfilled.

262
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,508
Spiffing!

263
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:53,139
What a wish, laddie!

264
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,760
More like a bombshell you dropped on all of us!

265
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,568
You've left many out of breath and many more gasping anxiously.

266
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,072
And you're here acting like you're innocent!

267
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,498
Got a signal from the other side?

268
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,389
Signal?

269
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,490
Don't tell me that 'signal' means just a signal in London.

270
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:25,531
I mean...

271
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,770
The green light, you know.

272
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,740
Doesn't it mean something else?

273
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,330
Of course. It's like, 'Go ahead'!

274
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,930
So, ol' chap, did Maheen say, 'Go ahead'?

275
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,530
Blimey, Uncle... Who knows what you're saying...

276
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,968
Told her?

277
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:46,878
Who?

278
00:22:46,878 --> 00:22:48,919
Maheen, of course!

279
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,448
She doesn't have the foggiest.

280
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:53,928
How do you know?

281
00:22:53,928 --> 00:22:55,648
Turn back before this very instant

282
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,238
If you value your life!

283
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,304
I'd even say,

284
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:02,784
Go and tell Ammi Begum

285
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:05,019
That you were kidding.

286
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,108
I meant every bit of it.

287
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,298
But if you want that Maheen marry Gulrez,

288
00:23:19,368 --> 00:23:21,168
I have no objections.

289
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:25,640
I haven't challenged the family by telling you my wish,

290
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,540
Nor insisted that you change your decisions.

291
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,451
Do what you've promised.

292
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,530
Congratulations.

293
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,749
Another one's desires have been sacrificed on the altar of 'justice'.

294
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:41,709
Hearing you, I figure

295
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,710
Maheen wants the same.

296
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,732
She doesn't even want to see my face!

297
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,468
She --

298
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:52,181
I just felt

299
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,301
If there's anyone I should marry, it's Maheen.

300
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,228
Can you keep it locked in your heart forever?

301
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:01,678
Of course.

302
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,830
Where could it go if let out?

303
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,201
I can't speak a word before that chit, let alone let my heart talk!

304
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,018
Just helpless feelings, Uncle...

305
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,018
Can be chained now...

306
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,571
Nobody hears a word if a kid's strangled the moment he's born.

307
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,998
What do I tell Ammi Begum?

308
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,848
Anything, really.

309
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,544
But please, don't say that I was kidding.

310
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,948
Feelings can be locked away...

311
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,998
But not the truth, Uncle.

312
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,348
Here's your tie.

313
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,398
No need.

314
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,088
Why?

315
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:17,419
You don't go to work without one.

316
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,279
I'm not going to work.

317
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,399
Then?

318
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,329
I'm going to meet Nano.

319
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,461
It --

320
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,861
Would be better if you didn't... For a few days...

321
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,609
Why?

322
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,318
Just -- Don't...

323
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,704
Why are you stopping me?

324
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,708
Wait for Maheen's reply.

325
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:54,130
I don't know why, but I have this feeling that if you went to Nano's,

326
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:57,879
She'd feel that you're there to beg...

327
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,948
I never beg.

328
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:01,770
You know that.

329
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,528
But they don't. Maheen doesn't.

330
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,518
That's what she'll think.

331
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,548
She won't.

332
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,878
I won't let her.

333
00:26:10,878 --> 00:26:13,488
Why must you be so adamant?

334
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:17,749
I had a nightmare last night.

335
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,138
Somewhere, in the eye of the storm...

336
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,898
You're shutting the doors and windows...

337
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,018
You're waiting

338
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,052
For Wali...

339
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,799
There's a knock on the door...

340
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,648
You open the door.

341
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,657
It's Wali...

342
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,020
You ask him to come in quickly,

343
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,181
And shut the door.

344
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,068
Wali's quiet...

345
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:55,958
Almost unusually...

346
00:26:56,129 --> 00:26:57,639
Shocked...

347
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,620
Distressed...

348
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,358
You take out a bottle of cold water from the fridge.

349
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:06,428
Give it to him...

350
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:09,918
He gestures a no...

351
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,338
Even though...

352
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,919
First thing he gets back, he has a glass...

353
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,369
You heard everything?

354
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,111
I thought you'd dozed off after taking the pill.

355
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:31,131
I'd actually dozed off.

356
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,881
I took the pill too.

357
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,641
Enough of your theatrics.

358
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,058
You heard <i>everything</i>!

359
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,338
I don't listen in on you and Wali.

360
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,858
Oh?

361
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,605
So you actually had this dream?

362
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,538
Go on, then.

363
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,658
I'll tell the rest to Nano.

364
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,649
So that's why you're going...

365
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:09,739
No.

366
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:14,342
I'm going to tell her I won't marry Maheen.

367
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:16,532
What rubbish!

368
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,303
Not rubbish...

369
00:28:20,004 --> 00:28:22,042
I saw that you

370
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,814
Were very worried.

371
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:27,774
The sister's mask had fallen off your face...

372
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,858
Revealing every bit of the mother.

373
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,320
The mother worried by every cough of her child's...

374
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,058
What've you become?

375
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,128
I've decided...

376
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,398
That I won't be the kid

377
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:58,179
Who'd ask his Mum for the moon to play with.

378
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:05,148
I just want the moonlight.

379
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,919
What'd he say?

380
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:57,779
He said he wants to get even with you.

381
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,399
He might've been joking.

382
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:02,778
He'd joke about marrying me?

383
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:04,409
Just ask him.

384
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,409
He may be serious.

385
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:08,750
I'll feed him his teeth!

386
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,939
That's what you ought to do.

387
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:11,990
What?

388
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,948
Feed him his teeth!

389
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,098
I do what I say, Mum.

390
00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:18,650
I guess

391
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,518
You're just waiting to finish breakfast, aye?

392
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,340
Do you have any idea what she'd do?

393
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,609
Aye.

394
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,461
What she ought to.

395
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,899
C'mon, finish your breakfast.

396
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,509
Hello?

397
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,709
Hello, Uncle Munshi.

398
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:12,989
Hello there.

399
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,470
Give the phone to Ali.

400
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,630
He's gone to school, Fajr.

401
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,899
Who goes to school on Doomsday?

402
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,219
Anyway...

403
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:22,786
Got a helmet?

404
00:31:22,786 --> 00:31:23,846
Helmet?

405
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:26,277
Find one, Uncle, pronto!

406
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,219
What'd you do with one?

407
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,800
Jeez...

408
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,610
Find one and give it to Waqar. Quick!

409
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,000
Has he...

410
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,978
Asked for one?

411
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,269
No!

412
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:41,640
It's a gift from me!

413
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,120
Good morning, Uncle Munshi.

414
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,948
'Morning.

415
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:03,129
Where's Nano?

416
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,838
In her room.

417
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:08,858
She doesn't come out very much these days.

418
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,589
Gulrez!

419
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,871
Waqar!

420
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,389
How are you?

421
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:41,559
Great.

422
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,944
But, blimey, mate,

423
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:46,179
Two months since I got here, but it's the second time we're seeing each other!

424
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:47,460
The third.

425
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,059
Not the second.

426
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,230
No way.

427
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,810
Just last night, in fact.

428
00:32:52,871 --> 00:32:56,072
I met you in my dream...

429
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,068
Good one.

430
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,559
It's not a joke, Waqar.

431
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,998
Although it sounds like one.

432
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,221
We don't need to meet those we want to meet.

433
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:13,352
We meet those

434
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,773
We think of.

435
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,299
Now, I've got to meet Nano,

436
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,688
But I can't meet her in my dreams.

437
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,188
Why?

438
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,498
I'd have to ask for her permission

439
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:29,049
Even to see her in my dreams.

440
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,890
Go.

441
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,588
She's in her room.

442
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,404
Who is it?

443
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,628
It's me, Nano.

444
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,138
Gulrez.

445
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,959
Come in, m'lad, come in.

446
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,488
Here to see me?

447
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:13,359
Aye, Nano.

448
00:34:14,517 --> 00:34:17,228
Skiving off work, eh?

449
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,049
I just did...

450
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:23,188
When did that happen?

451
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,599
I've never seen you

452
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:29,165
Skive off work.

453
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,278
Something's changed, Nano...

454
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,710
They say great men

455
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,578
Aren't bound by habits and rules.

456
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,868
Their habits keep changing,

457
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:47,858
As do their rules.

458
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,918
I've heard the same, too.

459
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,368
But...

460
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,978
Who told you

461
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,358
That skiving off work

462
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,128
Is gonna make you a great man?

463
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,348
Just thought

464
00:35:13,399 --> 00:35:15,399
I'd do something

465
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,759
That shows everyone

466
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,440
That Gulrez means business.

467
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,618
What are you up to?

468
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,731
I had a dream...

469
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:34,400
A bolt from the blue...

470
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,468
Bolt, eh, dear?

471
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,384
I'm already

472
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:47,118
In the eye of the thunderstorm.

473
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:50,598
You'd better do something

474
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:54,728
That gets me out of it.

475
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,478
That

476
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,919
Is just what I'm here for.

477
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,898
The dream was a sign...

478
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:03,829
What are you saying?

479
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,840
I'm honest, Nano.

480
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,220
I saw an old man with a long white beard.

481
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,261
He said,

482
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:15,701
'There's two kinds of lovers'.

483
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,767
'One, le peintre, working on his masterpiece of love'...

484
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,218
'Painter'!

485
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,268
Ah, yes...

486
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,310
'Painter'...

487
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,759
And the other?

488
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,379
'And two',

489
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,360
'The kind who buy masterpieces to adorn their walls with'.

490
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:43,890
So,

491
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,390
Which one

492
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,179
Would you be?

493
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:50,881
Certes, not the one

494
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:55,110
Who'd buy a painting to adorn my wall with...

495
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:00,949
Hmm...

496
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:03,938
So...

497
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,328
What'd you do?

498
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,900
I...

499
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,870
I'd just paint my masterpiece.

500
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,010
I'm done with it.

501
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:18,842
My story ends here.

502
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,728
And...

503
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,378
Who'd adorn his wall with your painting?

504
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:30,828
Waqar.

505
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,490
Waqar Ahmed.

506
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
