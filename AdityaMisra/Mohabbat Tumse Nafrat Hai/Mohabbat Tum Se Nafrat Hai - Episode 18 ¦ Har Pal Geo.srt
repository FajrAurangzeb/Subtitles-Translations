1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,828
Ready?

2
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,042
Aye.

3
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,090
Breaking news!

4
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,159
Not so fast. Keep an eye out.

5
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:31,083
Hey!

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,432
Please, Fajr.

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,433
If Mum saw me having tea and biscuits,

8
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,514
She'd think I'd give in to hunger.

9
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:40,483
You're not going to University again.

10
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,574
Don't even think about it!

11
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,624
It's my last semester.

12
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,014
Sorry! Mum's orders!

13
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:50,744
No way you're getting out of here.

14
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:52,073
Can it!

15
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,094
Told you! The game is on!

16
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:56,465
I say,

17
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:59,150
Instead of shouting or fighting back, just give in.

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,759
Forget your studies.

19
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,110
You off your head?

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,448
D'you know how much it'd cost me?

21
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,048
That's what they all say.

22
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,989
You don't think how much your decisions cost everyone.

23
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:11,988
Shut up!

24
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,969
You ought to bless me, Maheen!

25
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:17,269
I may be the last ray of hope for your doomed love!

26
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,102
<i>Soooo</i> sweet of you!

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,968
Done?

28
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,101
Not yet.

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,269
Mum's here! Quick! Hide!

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,848
Have something...

31
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:44,878
What have we here?

32
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,223
She hasn't had anything...

33
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:48,104
Good.

34
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,425
Good riddance of her

35
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:51,255
If she starves herself to death!

36
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,426
She's got this awful headache for the last one hour!

37
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:55,596
Big deal.

38
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,717
We've all had an awful headache since last night.

39
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:58,869
Out.

40
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,784
Lemme massage her head, Mum!

41
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,798
Just do as you're told.

42
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:05,699
And aye, where's the keys?

43
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:06,990
Keys?

44
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,191
Why d'you need them?

45
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:11,851
I've been ordered to lock the room.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,228
Very good!

47
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,218
Enough!

48
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,558
The only out... Is a pall!

49
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:20,877
Juliet's pall, I beg thee, must be <i>most</i> grand!

50
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:21,998
You blighter!

51
00:02:21,998 --> 00:02:22,820
And aye,

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,998
You're not going to University again.

53
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:26,350
I will.

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,891
Even if I have to jump out the window.

55
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,352
You don't know me, girl.

56
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:34,688
I'm Ammi Begum's daughter.

57
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:38,238
I'll char you with your obstinacy.

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,908
Speaking of her...

59
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,989
Could you tell Nano

60
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,669
She's making a big mistake

61
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,020
By taking up arms against love?

62
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,689
Those who hate love will be blown to bits.

63
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,891
At least have something before you go to bed, love, okay?

64
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,763
Ask him

65
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,844
Why he went with her.

66
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:38,569
I didn't.

67
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,510
She took me.

68
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:42,296
As if he's a kid

69
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,339
Who lost his way and went with whoever held his hand!

70
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,938
She was ashamed at what she did.

71
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,307
<i>Just</i>

72
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,948
Ashamed?

73
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,688
So she'd kill and say sorry

74
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,388
Because she's ashamed!

75
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,969
Who'd she kill?

76
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,355
Why, everyone standing there!

77
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,909
Wali,

78
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:07,130
Me,

79
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,630
You...!

80
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:12,095
At long last you name the one who actually died.

81
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,749
But I didn't lose my life to her.

82
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,302
They say you give your life for those who hold it dear.

83
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,338
Well said.

84
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:26,578
Wali,

85
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,368
Just tell him he's not seeing her again.

86
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,169
Why don't you say it?

87
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,581
I think he understands.

88
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,200
He won't see her again.

89
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,939
Good.

90
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:02,707
Logically, after so much insult, I thought, too,

91
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:05,027
That I'd never see her again.

92
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,766
But she's a girl...

93
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,718
And most like a girl...

94
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:17,348
She'd hide what lies in her heart so well

95
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:21,018
She wouldn't have the foggiest herself!

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,278
Thank goodness she found out.

97
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:28,448
In fact, thank goodness she found out in time.

98
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,317
I'm the only one insulted right now.

99
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,920
Love's been spared the ignominy.

100
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,931
Wait.

101
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,769
I'll go see.

102
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,998
Hi.

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,068
You're angry?

104
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,050
Won't you let me in?

105
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,968
Please go back.

106
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:11,898
We're mourning the recent death of his heart.

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,788
Praying for his soul.

108
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,358
It's best if the killer stayed at an arm's length.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,878
What's this?

110
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,860
A lunchbox.

111
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:10,909
What's in it?

112
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,019
Food.

113
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,288
For?

114
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:22,390
Yours truly.

115
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,870
Ours, who?

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,189
Don't you think

117
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,507
That makes no sense?

118
00:07:33,257 --> 00:07:36,121
It makes perfect sense to me.

119
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,147
Who you're about to give it to

120
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,757
Is truly not ours!

121
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,367
You've started talking like Ammi Begum!

122
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,527
He hasn't had anything since yesterday!

123
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:49,138
He refused to order anything.

124
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,697
The only thing he gets here is our wrath.

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,448
Send him as much as you like.

126
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,109
Where does he live?

127
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,958
I can't tell you that.

128
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:05,998
Whoa.

129
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:08,748
You refuse to tell your masters?

130
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:09,468
Here.

131
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,409
What are you doing?

132
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,328
Way to go, Mehrunnisa!

133
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:18,384
Could you be any more rebellious?

134
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:23,365
You'd cook food with your own hands

135
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:27,185
For the kids who've grown up to slander the family and bring it disgrace!

136
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,567
I won't marry anyone else, Mehrunnisa!

137
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,487
What was that?

138
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:37,968
Why'd you marry anyone else?

139
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,187
After you're gone, everyone's gonna ask me to.

140
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:44,906
I can turn them all down, but if Ammi Begum told me to...

141
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,580
Get a grip on yourself, M. Dastoor.

142
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,158
Mehrunnisa

143
00:08:50,158 --> 00:08:52,578
Ain't leaving you

144
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:53,789
Behind.

145
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:56,725
If Ammi Begum found out what you're up to,

146
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:59,040
She'd kill you for real!

147
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,277
She called me at work.

148
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:08,198
Asked me to send her

149
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,288
New cartridges.

150
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:13,760
If you don't want to be at the wrong end of the barrel,

151
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,748
Just let him starve to death!

152
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,708
Thought yourselves so clever, didn't you?

153
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,569
Ammi Begum was just outside, watching, hearing!

154
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,558
What are you looking for?

155
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:08,868
Here's your lunchbox. Get going!

156
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:11,354
Before the bugger starves to death!

157
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,518
You better sit too.

158
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,757
Spend your last few moments with me?

159
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,458
What are you looking at?

160
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,460
Munshi Alam...

161
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,371
I won't let him out of my sights.

162
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,087
Stay on my six!

163
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:51,838
Quickly!

164
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,367
Hello?

165
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,928
Hello, partner!

166
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,768
Make it quick. I'm being watched!

167
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:09,140
We're sending him food.

168
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,928
Don't tell me!

169
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:15,788
I've seen it myself! Munshi Alam packed a lunchbox for him!

170
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:17,318
Where does he live?

171
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,550
We'll find out tonight.

172
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,587
We're tailing Munshi Alam.

173
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:23,996
Who's tailing him?

174
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,327
Ammi Begum!

175
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:29,176
Although Mum and Dad think <i>they</i>'re tailing him.

176
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,907
I don't get it.

177
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,578
Have you got a black suit?

178
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,638
Aye.

179
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,440
Maheen does too, I'm sure?

180
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,390
Aye, but --

181
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,981
Put it on.

182
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,550
Why?

183
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:44,803
Waqar ain't comin' back alive.

184
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,100
Munshi Alam thought he could outfox us.

185
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,968
How d'you like them apples now?

186
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,657
I'll catch him red-handed,

187
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:09,612
And drop the London tramp

188
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,013
At the airport.

189
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,488
Hmm...

190
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,100
What about Maheen?

191
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,680
I mean, he was almost at the airport...

192
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:23,521
Maheen called to stop him.

193
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,058
If he deserves punishment for coming back,

194
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,118
What about the one who stopped him?

195
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:31,638
Don't worry. She won't be spared.

196
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,868
She's marrying Gulrez.

197
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,170
At last...

198
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,917
So you concede that marrying her off to Gulrez is a punishment.

199
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,868
Is that rebellion I catch a whiff of in your voice, Mehrunnisa?

200
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,938
Not just a whiff, M. Dastoor Ahmed...

201
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,398
More like a rank stench,

202
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,971
Not of rebellion,

203
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:01,591
But of the truth that rots in your heart as much as mine,

204
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,478
And I'm sure

205
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,205
Ammi Begum's.

206
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,721
Except she covers it up for the sake of Gulrez.

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,914
Like anyone else her age, she thinks she can stop lovers.

208
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:19,937
I dare her to!

209
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,939
I wonder if you can say any of that to Ammi Begum's face...

210
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,615
I can.

211
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,311
But I'd rather you not marry someone else.

212
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,460
But then...

213
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,418
If not me, who?

214
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:49,905
Could you?

215
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:53,698
Before you get her the new cartridges,

216
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,449
Gather your courage and say it.

217
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,398
There!

218
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:08,130
Your pointless banter made me lose sight of Munshi Alam!

219
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,451
No idea if he went right or left...

220
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,298
Left!

221
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,801
Hello?

222
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:49,831
You alone?

223
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:50,942
Aye.

224
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:52,661
HVT bagged!

225
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:54,331
Oh, God...

226
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,032
Where?

227
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,734
At the farmhouse.

228
00:14:57,784 --> 00:14:59,874
Who bagged him?

229
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,034
Mum, Dad, and Dado!

230
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,225
Poor kid.

231
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,805
I'll break the news and get back to you!

232
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,045
Okay.

233
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,131
Hello?

234
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,021
Bad news!

235
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,021
Yeah?

236
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,246
He's been done over.

237
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,770
Good!

238
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:34,051
Why do you 'good'-'very good' everything?

239
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,252
I'm delighted!

240
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:37,372
I mean,

241
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,533
The world's changed,

242
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,872
But not the loathing some people have for love!

243
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,792
It's always been this way.

244
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,262
Two fall in love,

245
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:46,913
And two hundred hate it!

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,831
That's how it is

247
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,651
In 2008, as in 1908...

248
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,933
Anyway, can't talk. Gotta write my diary!

249
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,038
All my fault...

250
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:40,839
I thought I could be friends with all...

251
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,567
It's cost me dearly...

252
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,860
I raised all my kids with so much love...

253
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,777
Only to see them grow into rebels...

254
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,501
They hate

255
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:08,579
And love who they want.

256
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:18,129
Their love does not rest until it's quaffed the blood out of others' love...

257
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:23,078
The quandary

258
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,468
For my unfortunate self

259
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,168
Is that the one quaffing the blood

260
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:32,291
Is a piece of myself,

261
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,398
And whose blood should he drink

262
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,381
But the one

263
00:17:40,496 --> 00:17:43,147
Who has a special place in my heart?

264
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:52,308
How can you stay in one piece when parts of yourself go up in arms against each other, Waqar Ahmed?

265
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:04,148
I heard the words of those who fear me just so they can please me.

266
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,248
What did you say?

267
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,820
'Not just a whiff, M. Dastoor Ahmed'...

268
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,057
'More like the rank stench'

269
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,178
'Of the truth that rots'

270
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,851
'Inside you, as inside me',

271
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:30,206
'Hoping to get out someday',

272
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,562
'As it does'

273
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:36,348
'Inside Ammi Begum, I'm sure',

274
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,657
'Except she covers it up'

275
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:44,333
'For the sake of Gulrez Akhtar'...

276
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,797
And also...

277
00:18:50,058 --> 00:18:56,918
'Like everyone her age, Ammi Begum thinks she can stand in the way of lovers'...

278
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,409
'I dare her to stop love if she's so powerful'!

279
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,642
What do I tell you...

280
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,030
If love could be stopped so easily,

281
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,808
Elders like ourselves

282
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,698
Wouldn't be watching over you young'uns.

283
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,090
Love is not stopped, Mehrunnisa.

284
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:32,626
The kids are.

285
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:36,396
They're told,

286
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,210
'Don't go this way',

287
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,110
'Don't look that way'...

288
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,681
But, alas, there's times we fail...

289
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:50,522
Sometimes, we can't stop them from going or looking...

290
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,780
You can't make a garland

291
00:19:56,841 --> 00:20:00,050
Without piercing flowers with a needle.

292
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,971
Likewise,

293
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:06,360
You have to pierce all relations with a cold but tearful spite

294
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:11,970
To hold them together like a wreath.

295
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,789
Elders like ourselves, Mehrunnisa,

296
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:24,788
Don't just

297
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:30,519
Brag about our place merely on account of our age...

298
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,567
It's a thorny throne of responsibilities up there.

299
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,978
Responsibilities

300
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:42,068
Force us to deal justly.

301
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,059
And justice...

302
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:50,229
Has a penchant for landing us in a fix...

303
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,458
There's one Maheen,

304
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,688
Coveted by two -

305
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,929
Both dearer to me than my life...

306
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,741
Tell me...

307
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,809
Who gets Maheen,

308
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:22,918
And who, bad news?

309
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,248
In that moment,

310
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:31,358
I just decided, thinking

311
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,348
That the Lord loves His creation

312
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:40,088
Far more than all of us combined,

313
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,538
Yet even He cannot please everyone...

314
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,740
You gonna get going, Dastoor Ahmed?

315
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,270
Or do you intend to look at my face

316
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,800
In this accursed place?

317
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,738
C'mon.

318
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,920
Let those who want

319
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,868
Stay here.

320
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,798
You!

321
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,339
Seraj Akbar?

322
00:23:31,123 --> 00:23:32,499
Aye?

323
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,149
Jiya.

324
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,809
From Mir Mehtab's office.

325
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:40,978
Mir Mehtab...

326
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,998
Come in.

327
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,528
Please.

328
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,778
Nine...

329
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:00,448
Ten...

330
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,393
Eleven...

331
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,338
Peace be upon you, Mlle Maheen!

332
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,448
And upon you, peace.

333
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:11,231
How are you?

334
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,052
Fine, by the Lord's grace.

335
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,433
Are you going to University?

336
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,053
Yeah.

337
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,414
May I, Mum?

338
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,828
What are you looking at?

339
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:29,004
The door ain't the only way out, you know.

340
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,024
Bye!

341
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,698
Eleven...

342
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:41,880
Go on...

343
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:44,254
Twelve...

344
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:45,515
Thirteen...

345
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,084
Fourteen...

346
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,401
Fifteen 'ere...

347
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:50,692
And...

348
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,268
Sixteen.

349
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,098
That's sixteen in all.

350
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:57,572
I say you'll...

351
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:00,582
Get it back in five days.

352
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,386
Haven't you got family?

353
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:06,917
I mean --

354
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:08,917
D'you live all alone?

355
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:11,767
Haven't gotten married.

356
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,398
No wife. No kids.

357
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,589
Just loved once...

358
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,667
That experience taught me

359
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:28,958
You love one

360
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,000
And marry another.

361
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,058
I thought I could go on with love...

362
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,880
But to be honest, with nothing in your pocket,

363
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,168
Love hardly makes any difference.

364
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,738
I talk a lot, don't I?

365
00:25:52,238 --> 00:25:55,199
M. Jamshedi told me

366
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,940
You're a handwriting expert.

367
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,775
I'm a poet! A poet!

368
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,856
A writer.

369
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:07,765
But when that doesn't work,

370
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,000
I have to do some of these odd jobs on the side.

371
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,936
By the way, someone who can copy handwriting is no handwriting expert.

372
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:19,354
Get it?

373
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,178
As in, copy it exactly?

374
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,891
I could write what I want

375
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,183
And you'd think you've written it yourself.

376
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,168
But

377
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,853
I don't write less than ten pages.

378
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,919
Don't worry. You'll be writing much more.

379
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,339
But

380
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,768
I don't want the slightest mistake.

381
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,098
Here.

382
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,730
Write something here.

383
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:02,770
Lemme show you.

384
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,900
Go on. Write something...

385
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,920
Peace be upon you!

386
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,528
Here.

387
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:48,608
Have a look.

388
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,620
'I positively loathe Maheen'
'I positively loathe Maheen'

389
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,348
Here.

390
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,798
10 gee. Your advance.

391
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,598
10 gee... Advance?

392
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,918
Maheen!

393
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:12,679
Maheen?

394
00:29:13,258 --> 00:29:14,808
He's here!

395
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:15,550
Who?

396
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,368
Your killer!

397
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,421
D'you know Mir Mehtab?

398
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,940
Aye.

399
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,648
Very well.

400
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:36,099
You'll get an additional 40 gee in three days.

401
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:42,143
Feel free to ask me if you need more.

402
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,502
Anytime.

403
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,908
As long as you live.

404
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,628
Okay?

405
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,559
But there's one condition...

406
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,662
And what would that be?

407
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,488
You're taking this secret with you...

408
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:01,518
You're taking this secret with you... Into your grave.

409
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,767
Agreed.

410
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,247
Peace, Aunt.

411
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,071
Upon you too.

412
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:22,950
Thought I'd come here when I heard the news.

413
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,757
Aye.

414
00:30:23,757 --> 00:30:24,578
Come.

415
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:25,879
Sit.

416
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,968
Want some tea?

417
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,248
No.

418
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:37,968
Like I care.

419
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,520
Actually... I think I'd have a cuppa...

420
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,857
Zeenat!

421
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:45,578
Zeenat!

422
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:48,597
Get some tea for Waqar.

423
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:49,934
Ma'am.

424
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,319
How's she, Aunt?

425
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,028
Never been better.

426
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,808
The shooter had a lousy aim.

427
00:30:57,808 --> 00:30:59,179
If I got hold of him,

428
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,349
I'm gonna fix him with my boots!

429
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,288
I'm sure she's scared.

430
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm sure you know now

431
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,913
She doesn't fear bullets.

432
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,797
I hear

433
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,249
You left everything behind?

434
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,838
And now... You're back?

435
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,059
Aye.

436
00:31:19,438 --> 00:31:21,122
I was in hiding, but

437
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:22,852
Dado found me.

438
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:26,156
When she got to me, I felt she wanted me to come back. So I did.

439
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:29,715
There goes your plan to run off to London...

440
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:30,995
Aye.

441
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:32,986
I ain't going to London now.

442
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,779
What are you looking at?

443
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,450
Nothing, Aunt.

444
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,870
Nothing, really...

445
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,840
Her room's upstairs.

446
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,088
Aye.

447
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,428
I know.

448
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:48,908
Don't even look her way.

449
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,970
I just thought I'd check on her --

450
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,158
Don't even think about it.

451
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:53,818
Ask me all you want.

452
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:56,159
You just told me she's fine.

453
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,428
Of course. So she is.

454
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,368
Any idea who the shooter could be?

455
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,208
What good is it?

456
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:10,258
He failed miserably.

457
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,508
What?

458
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,349
Forget it.

459
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,886
Nothing you should be bothered about.

460
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,978
If I got my hands on him,

461
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,606
I'll sort him out!

462
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,148
How?

463
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,088
And why?

464
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,378
My blood's boiling, Aunt!

465
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,788
Just shut up,

466
00:32:28,788 --> 00:32:30,188
Have your cuppa,

467
00:32:30,188 --> 00:32:31,979
And go back.

468
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,578
May I see her once?

469
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:35,540
What d'you mean?

470
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,888
I mean --

471
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:39,402
I'd see her and ask her how she is.

472
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:41,803
If you don't mind, of course.

473
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,557
Take the cup!

474
00:32:46,023 --> 00:32:47,997
I'm asking Zeenat!

475
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,997
Take the cup away and leave.

476
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,118
And what are <i>you</i> looking at?

477
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:01,188
Get up.

478
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,408
Say goodbye and get out.

479
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,928
Okay...

480
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,451
Peace indeed, Aunt...

481
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,419
Aye?

482
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:51,906
Hope you didn't hit!

483
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:54,527
Good.

484
00:33:55,877 --> 00:33:57,637
That's enough.

485
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,824
What it is is, she's a friend.

486
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,120
My life.

487
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,938
I won't kill her so easily.

488
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,421
Bullets don't nearly hurt as much as grief.

489
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:17,382
Grief does not kill

490
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,430
In one

491
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,190
Swift shot...

492
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,900
Bye.

493
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
