1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ready?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Breaking news!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast. Keep an eye out.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Fajr.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Mum saw me having tea and biscuits,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd think I'd give in to hunger.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going to University again.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's my last semester.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry! Mum's orders!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way you're getting out of here.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you! The game is on!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say,

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Instead of shouting or fighting back, just give in.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget your studies.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know how much it'd cost me?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what they all say.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't think how much your decisions cost everyone.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ought to bless me, Maheen!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the last ray of hope for your doomed love!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Soooo sweet of you!</i>

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not yet.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum's here! Quick! Hide!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have something...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What have we here?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She hasn't had anything...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good riddance of her

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she starves herself to death!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got this awful headache for the last one hour!

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've all had an awful headache since last night.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme massage her head, Mum!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just do as you're told.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye, where's the keys?

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keys?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you need them?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been ordered to lock the room.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very good!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only out... Is a pall!

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Juliet's pall, I beg thee, must be most grand!</i>

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blighter!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye,

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not going to University again.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if I have to jump out the window.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know me, girl.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm Ammi Begum's daughter.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll char you with your obstinacy.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speaking of her...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you tell Nano

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's making a big mistake

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By taking up arms against love?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who hate love will be blown to bits.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least have something before you go to bed, love, okay?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why he went with her.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She took me.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if he's a kid

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who lost his way and went with whoever held his hand!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was ashamed at what she did.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ashamed?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she'd kill and say sorry

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because she's ashamed!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd she kill?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, everyone standing there!

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali,

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me,

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You...!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At long last you name the one who actually died.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I didn't lose my life to her.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say you give your life for those who hold it dear.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well said.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali,

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell him he's not seeing her again.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say it?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think he understands.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't see her again.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Logically, after so much insult, I thought, too,

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd never see her again.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she's a girl...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And most like a girl...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd hide what lies in her heart so well

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wouldn't have the foggiest herself!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness she found out.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, thank goodness she found out in time.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the only one insulted right now.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love's been spared the ignominy.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go see.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're angry?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you let me in?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please go back.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're mourning the recent death of his heart.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Praying for his soul.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's best if the killer stayed at an arm's length.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A lunchbox.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's in it?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Food.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yours truly.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ours, who?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That makes no sense?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It makes perfect sense to me.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who you're about to give it to

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is truly not ours!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've started talking like Ammi Begum!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He hasn't had anything since yesterday!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He refused to order anything.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only thing he gets here is our wrath.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send him as much as you like.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where does he live?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't tell you that.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You refuse to tell your masters?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to go, Mehrunnisa!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you be any more rebellious?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd cook food with your own hands

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the kids who've grown up to slander the family and bring it disgrace!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't marry anyone else, Mehrunnisa!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you marry anyone else?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After you're gone, everyone's gonna ask me to.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can turn them all down, but if Ammi Begum told me to...

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get a grip on yourself, M. Dastoor.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't leaving you

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Behind.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Ammi Begum found out what you're up to,

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd kill you for real!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She called me at work.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asked me to send her

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
New cartridges.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't want to be at the wrong end of the barrel,

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just let him starve to death!

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought yourselves so clever, didn't you?

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum was just outside, watching, hearing!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking for?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your lunchbox. Get going!

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before the bugger starves to death!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better sit too.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Spend your last few moments with me?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam...

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let him out of my sights.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Follow me!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, partner!

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make it quick. I'm being watched!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're sending him food.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tell me!

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen it myself! Munshi Alam packed a lunchbox for him!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where does he live?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll find out tomorrow.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're following Munshi Alam.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's following him?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although Mum and Dad think they're following him.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't get it.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you got a black suit?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen does too, I'm sure?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but --

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put it on.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar ain't comin' back alive.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam thought he could outfox us.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How d'you like them apples now?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll catch him red-handed,

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And drop the London tramp

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the airport.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about Maheen?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, he was almost at the airport...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen called to stop him.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he deserves punishment for coming back,

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about the one who stopped him?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. She won't be spared.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's marrying Gulrez.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At last...

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you concede that marrying her off to Gulrez is a punishment.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that rebellion I catch a whiff of in your voice, Mehrunnisa?

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not just a whiff, M. Dastoor...

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
More like a rank stench,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not of rebellion,

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of the truth that rots in your heart as much as mine,

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'm sure

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except she covers it up for the sake of Gulrez.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like anyone else her age, she thinks she can stop lovers.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dare her to!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wonder if you can say any of that to Ammi Begum's face...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'd rather you not marry someone else.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If not me, who?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before you get her the new cartridges,

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gather your courage and say it.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your pointless banter made me lose sight of Munshi Alam!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea if he went right or left...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Left.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You alone?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HVT bagged!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, God...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the farmhouse.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who bagged him?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum, Dad, and Dado!

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor kid.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll break the news and get back to you!

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bad news!

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been done over.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you 'good'-'very good' everything?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm delighted!

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The world's changed,

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not the loathing some people have for love!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's always been this way.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two fall in love,

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And two hundred hate it!

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how it is

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In 2008, as in 1908...

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, can't talk. Gotta write my diary!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All my fault...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I could be friends with all...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's cost me dearly...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I raised all my kids with so much love...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only to see them grow into rebels...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They hate

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And love who they want.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Their love does not rest until it's quaffed the blood out of others' love...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The quandary

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my unfortunate self

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that the one quaffing the blood

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is a piece of myself,

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And whose blood should he drink

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the one

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who has a special place in my heart?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can you stay in one piece when parts of yourself go up in arms against each other, Waqar Ahmed?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard the words of those who fear me just so they can please me.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you say?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Not just a whiff, M. Dastoor'...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'More like the rank stench'

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Of the truth that rots'

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Inside you, as inside me',

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Hoping to get out someday',

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'As it does'

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Inside Ammi Begum, I'm sure',

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Except she covers it up'

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'For the sake of Gulrez Akhtar'...

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And also...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Like everyone her age, Ammi Begum thinks she can stand in the way of lovers'...

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I dare her to stop love if she's so powerful'!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell you...

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If love could be stopped so easily,

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elders like ourselves

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wouldn't be watching over you young'uns.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is not stopped, Mehrunnisa.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The kids are.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're told,

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't go this way',

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't look that way'...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, alas, there's times we fail...

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, we can't stop them from going or looking...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't make a garland

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without piercing flowers with a needle.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Likewise,

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to pierce all relations with a cold but tearful spite

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To hold them together like a wreath.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elders like ourselves, Mehrunnisa,

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't just

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brag about our place merely on account of our age...

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a thorny throne of responsibilities up there.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Responsibilities

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Force us to deal justly.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And justice...

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has a penchant for landing us in a fix...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's one Maheen,

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coveted by two -

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Both dearer to me than my life...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who gets Maheen,

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And who, bad news?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that moment,

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just decided, thinking

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the Lord loves His creation

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Far more than all of us combined,

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yet even He cannot please everyone...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna get going, Dastoor Ahmed?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or do you intend to look at my face

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In this wretched place?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let those who want

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay here.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You!

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seraj Akbar?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From Mir Mehtab's office.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mir Mehtab...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nine...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ten...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eleven...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Mlle. Maheen!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine, by the Lord's grace.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you going to University?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I, Mum?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The door ain't the only way out, you know.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eleven...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on...

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Twelve...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thirteen...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fourteen...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fifteen 'ere...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sixteen.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's sixteen in all.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say you'll...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it back in five days.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you got family?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you live all alone?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't gotten married.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No wife. No kids.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just loved once...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That experience taught me

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love one

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And marry another.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I could go on with love...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But to be honest, with nothing in your pocket,

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love hardly makes any difference.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I talk a lot, don't I?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M. Jamshedi told me

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a handwriting expert.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a poet! A poet!

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A writer.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when that doesn't work,

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have to do some of these odd jobs on the side.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, someone who can copy handwriting is no handwriting expert.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, copy it exactly?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could write what I want

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you'd think you've written it yourself.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't write less than ten pages.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. You'll be writing much more.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want the slightest mistake.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Write something here.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme show you.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on. Write something...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a look.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
10 gee. Your advance.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
10 gee... Advance?

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your killer!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know Mir Mehtab?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very well.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get an additional 40 gee in three days.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to ask me if you need more.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anytime.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as you live.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But there's one condition...

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what would that be?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're taking this secret with you...

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're taking this secret with you... Into your grave.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Agreed.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd come here when I heard the news.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want some tea?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like I care.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually... I think I'd have a cuppa...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zeenat!

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Zeenat!

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get some tea for Waqar.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's she, Aunt?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never been better.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The shooter had a lousy aim.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I got hold of him,

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna fix him with my boots!

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she's scared.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you know now

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't fear bullets.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You left everything behind?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now... You're back?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was in hiding, but

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado found me.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she got to me, I felt she wanted me to come back. So I did.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There goes your plan to run off to London...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't going to London now.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, Aunt.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really...

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her room's upstairs.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even look her way.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just thought I'd check on her --

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me all you want.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just told me she's fine.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. So she is.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any idea who the shooter could be?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What good is it?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He failed miserably.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing you should be bothered about.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I got my hands on him,

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sort him out!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And why?

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My blood's boiling, Aunt!

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just shut up,

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have your cuppa,

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And go back.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I see her once?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd see her and ask her how she is.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't mind, of course.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the cup!

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm asking Zeenat!

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the cup away and leave.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what are <i>you</i> looking at?</i>

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say goodbye and get out.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace indeed, Aunt...

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hope you didn't hit!

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's enough.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is is, she's a friend.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My life.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't kill her so easily.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bullets don't hurt as much as grief.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grief does not kill

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In one swift shot...

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
