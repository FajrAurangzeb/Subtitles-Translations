1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case, I admit that I love you.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't pay the bill; I've left my wallet at home.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pay the bill.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Muck!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He hasn't lost the match.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blighter's lost his heart.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I look like I'm lying?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I'm trying to forget his disappearance

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And think about his running away.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you remember how he'd darted?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like Santosh after Laila in Ishq'e Laila [old movie]!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one quandary sorted out.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quandary?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meaning?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean he's found someone too.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not like that.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then what's he like?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What times!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you'd tell Kaneez Begum who's like what!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you see my hair?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The greys reflect experience.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew it when the lad ran

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where he was headed.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't go there.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can give it in writing.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not as if these blacks reflect inexperience.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame, you're talking to Ammi Begum.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't intervene; we're having a gang meeting.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You stay out of it.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're all equals in the gang.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you, Chief?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I also knew when the lad ran

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where he was headed.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did she say as she left?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same as you were.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, my dear.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I was saying was different.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The meeting is adjourned.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like one thing about you.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're a boy, yet you don't believe in part-time affairs.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if --

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're from London, aren't you?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to live in London; I've left it since.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you have affairs there?

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To be frank, there sure was this itch in the beginning.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, it was almost as if someone had whispered to me,

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Love the one you talk love to'.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't besmirch the name of love through 'affairs'.'

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I never use this term 'love affair'.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Affair can never be love

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And love can never be an affair.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the time? I think I'm getting late.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you a girl?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls in Pakistan talk like this.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'It's getting late',

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Dad will be back',

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Please let me go'.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like your sense of humour.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen will never understand.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What will she not understand?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you don't despise her.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, mate.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't despise her; she despises me.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could've hit a six on the first ball.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But just kept on batting through her balls.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just want her to win, but

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want her to despise me.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't despise you, Waqar.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loves you.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, mate.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she starts loving me, Gulrez's curses will kill me.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It just can't be.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she can be forgiven for one murder, she'd kill me right away.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can be forgiven for one murder, who would you kill?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't even kill an ant.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You killed an ant.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just said something trivial and you crushed it under its weight.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Huh!

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways, tell me.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you are convinced that Maheen doesn't love you

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who would you love?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this guff?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you love someone?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course I would.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just waiting, Jiya.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you know what,

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get a feeling that love is in the air...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With whom?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just got this feeling...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not the name.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's headed for me.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you don't believe it.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I believe it.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright then.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No more conversations about Maheen.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I can give it in writing, it can't be Maheen.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean she's Gulrez's.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen to me.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not having an affair with Jiya.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you telling me?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's important that you know.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't give a hoot what you do or don't do.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I would like to say one thing

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you make a place for yourself in a girl's heart, learn to stay there.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't learn this so easily in London

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But girl's hearts are not leaseholds

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you can leave at your leisure.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I'm afraid of you, Gulrez.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad said,

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'When he turns 24, get him married'.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you smiling?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm 25.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you'll be 26 this December.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And 27 the next December.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So will I just keep counting your years?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I do?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to Maheen today itself

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or look for another girl.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This --

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is Wali reading a book sitting here?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to you if he's reading here?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything's according to a plan, right?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali doesn't usually read here.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You scallywag!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you dragging me in?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's quite the mouthful.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now he's going to start too.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please let me finish it by saying one thing.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't have the option of another girl.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if she has a second option?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the big deal, bud?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll attend her wedding.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dancing, singing, feasting all the way!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then you won't marry.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blooming Devdas! [tragic lover]

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll convince her.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tomorrow, if not today; if not tomorrow --

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If not tomorrow, never.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a moment after tomorrow.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Convince her

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or tell me a second option.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't utter a word.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not having an affair with Jiya.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya Madam had talked to me on the interphone.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said that she's outside, and asked me to tell Waqar Sir that she's coming in if he doesn't come out in two minutes.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read them?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are countless others.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, what do I do?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's simple.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell him to talk to Maheen.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And get married to her.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not a joke.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I agree

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is indeed no joke.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what's happening is a complete farce.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're surrounded by threats.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're his sister.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You claim to know him well.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the truth is

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know him better than you.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We laugh at his love for his Foxy.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Deep down, we don't laugh.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're ashamed

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That our commitment to love isn't as pure.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd die for Maheen

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you create this illusion of another girl to keep him alive

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trying to change his heart.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But only he knows

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you can only love one.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And her name is Maheen Aurangzeb.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None but her.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love is an affliction

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This vaurien often seeks a place

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where it is de trop.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have always learnt something new from him.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, loving like him,

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And sometimes, beaming in pain like him,

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And sometimes

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Weeping like him,

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without a trace of a tear from the eyes.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid of him, Neelam.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
People like him

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Always get love.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't get

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one they love.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can it be anger over the match?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado had said that Maheen's team won.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's she angry about?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your little escapade with Jiya

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Probably that.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think she's angry because you left the match and ran away.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But that's Fajr's point of view.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scares you, doesn't it?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you have to ruffle her then?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There were just two balls left.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've just batted

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or hit sixes

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then gone with her.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways what's done's been done.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her --

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can play a match again today.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget the chance of her playing cricket with you.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb doesn't play cricket with deserters.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but this is her line.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no interest either.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be careful while speaking.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, someone might just tell her.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who will tell her? Who's listening other than you?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, I would, of course.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't keep a secret for more than two days.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up,

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said get up!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another mistake

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking the Chief's right hand man to get out?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Meh!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir 'Chief's right hand'!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sissy's wimpish skivvy.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get out.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're taking me lightly.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're talking.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wh --

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was Fajr saying?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is she angry?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, really.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was just guessing.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you know what?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen says,

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr is the less intelligent between the two of us.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, now!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What brings you here?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The same as you.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh really. I come here everyday.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What am I seeing today?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have thoughts of me brought you here?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think of those who have become distant.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see you around here every now and then.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Mum?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Left for Nano's.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But today's Sunday!

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not about Sunday.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's because she took Waqar along.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Jiya.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Nano's thought

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About both of them.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was saying, 'The girl's nice and beautiful'.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Why not get the couple married'?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could happen?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was thinking --

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya's such a nice girl --

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Waqar's a Londoner tramp.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't quite fit.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether it fits or not,

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The two love each other.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't; I know.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya has no interest in him.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just -- his friend.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long does it take for a friend to become a wife?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The journey starts with just one attempt.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Attempt?

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One utterance of 'I love you', of course!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else do you call it?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let them get married.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I give a hoot.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it well.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, Jiya and Waqar look wonderful together.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's good.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two weddings in this season.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How fun will it be!

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two? Who else?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You, of course.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I 'shut up'? Won't you get married?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if that's so, why don't you tell everyone?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you standing here like that?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Standing here like this'?

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blabbering blighter!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pull my leg all you want.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This way, you're proving your friendship with her.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry mate.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You took it seriously.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not me; she's serious, you fool.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About whom?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya, please. Don't start.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't a time for jokes.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not joking.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's engaged to Gulrez. He'd die for her!

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That witch is after me like crazy!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you don't deserve it!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you even know what happened?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You slapped her.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she told the world about it!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea about the world.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm her closest friend. I know everything.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya... I thought you were sensible.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Were'?

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, if you knew everything,

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you tell her how wrong she was?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy, mate. Kids make mistakes.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kids?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she was an infant four years ago!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been four years but she remembers as if it was just yesterday!

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask you something?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you feel bad that she still remembers the slap,

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or that she ignores you?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me, who is she?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I care if she ignores me?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's emboldened her, or else...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Else?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or another slap would bring her back to her senses.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least let me vent out in words, mate...

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Loser!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She may be a bit on the impish side...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bit on the rowdy side, too...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, our Maheen's on the rowdy side too...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plus, she's Maheen's friend...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks good.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd do.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do what?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd do for Waqar like you did for Mehrunnisa.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's what it's about.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever you think.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't ask you.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm asking Suraiyya and Mehrunnisa.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say she'd do.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And guess who's here!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hiya, Dado.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good morning to you, too.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get anything you want, my dear.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd even get

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever you want.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are we talking about that?

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're just talking about her...

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been seeing her, meeting her, my dear...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tell me if you've talked about it.</i>

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, nothing, just the gewgaws of marriage...

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose marriage?

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My lad's learnt acting in London.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me talk.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me her address.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better. Or I'll ask Maheen.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her what?

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Dado, tell me something.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's talking about Jiya.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that it's in the open,

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me her address and number.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me talk to her

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before her parents.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'll you talk about?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that coyness

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or you trying to fool everyone?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado, by the L --
-Don't swear.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like her.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've even looked at your stars.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seen the omens, too.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a match made in Heaven.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you even hearing what you say?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did I say I want to marry Jiya?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So are you just gadding about with her?

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think Karachi's anything like London, you twit?

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is how it is.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When a girl would be caught enjoying herself with someone,

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The elders would get her married to him.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In short,

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been caught.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Caught'? If she's my friend -- and she grabbed my hand -- you'd say I've been 'caught gadding about'?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not the type!

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way I'm marrying Jiya.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who, then?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyone but Jiya.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on to the railing.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step up onto the railing.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why was Nano rubbing her hands?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't ask.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali just said she started rubbing her hands when it was all over.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her face was drained of all colour.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turn up the volume.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me think.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he says he won't marry Jiya...

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the problem?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must be after some English rose.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd marry her.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. That's why Ammi Begum's troubled.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with that?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can bring his English rose if he wants.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all about the heart, Fajr.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all about Ammi Begum's honour, Maheen.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's as good as dead if he brought his English rose.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How come?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wouldn't she die if she heard English all day?

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd much rather kill someone!

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, though,

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he wasn't interested in Jiya,

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why was he dating her?

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey! She's his friend.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Boys and girls are never just friends.</i>

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never knew you were so conservative.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me tell you.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who tell the truth are conservative.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boys are always ready to prowl in 'friendship'.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment she gets weak, she goes down.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Jiya.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What she'd do if Waqar proposed to her.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd accept it, of course.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just ask her.

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me the phone.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The number you've dialled is busy...

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's busy.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Must be talking to him.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We were on the plane together. Had a chat, became friends.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What then?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We know about your friendship. Go on.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on about what?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't fallen in love yet, eh?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But of course...

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must've told you he's in touch with the ladies of London.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He isn't in touch with anyone.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's your ordinary boy-next-door. He just says that to tease you.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better tell me the truth.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very happy. Otherwise...

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, be happy.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's very good.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he is...

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marry him.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, you'd look so good with him.

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm playing matchmaker.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he never --

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It never felt that...

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a blighter, just like the East India Company.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could see they were here to plunder everything?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just caught him red-handed.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could see he's got his eyes on you.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who have you got with you?

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Dad.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me his number.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need to see him tomorrow.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ammi Begum. It's nothing like that.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you ask him?

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me about yourself.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him first.

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he agrees,

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So will I.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, let me tell you.

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I accept it on his behalf.

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me your Dad's number.

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't believe it, right?

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm coming with the ring tomorrow.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll put it on you before leaving.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would?

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame, dear. Back in our day, Mums and Grannies used to do these things.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll give you his number.

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me...

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll bring him.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may put the ring on me,

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But do so before him.

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise you. I'll put the ring on you before him.

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what you say.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send you the number.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed!

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa! Where are you?

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got news.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Ammi Begum?

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything alright?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Not just alright!</i>

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take a seat.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may just trip and fall if you heard it.

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said yes.

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you ask me?

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Ammi Begum? Who?

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya.

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did she say yes to?
-The proposal about her and Waqar's marriage!

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if theirs is any match!

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's that guff?

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was swearing

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he isn't interested in Jiya.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't marry Jiya.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he agreed?

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't, Ammi Begum.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was stressing it so much.

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I understood him.

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over there.

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's coming.

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him yourself.

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See whether he stands firm or agrees to marry Jiya.

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait a minute, my sweetie.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me give you the news too.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talked to Jiya?

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't she call you?

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She did.

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been calling for the last 15 minutes.

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, young man, talk to her, will you?

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Must be something important.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody tries continuously for 15 minutes for nothing.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did she grow so much on you?

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's such a close friend of Maheen's.

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That makes her

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like Maheen to me.

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast, you twit.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Spouting English and running away, eh?

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're going to her place tomorrow.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's her Dad's number.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked for her hand in marriage.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her Dad tomorrow and formalise it.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he accepts it,

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll come back after I've put the ring on her.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before you.

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may do it yourself if you want.

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have no issues.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What in the world is your problem?

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think I am?

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A blimming circus-monkey who'd dance to your tunes?

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think I'd start loving Jiya because you ordered me to?

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd marry her if you put a ring on her?

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart doesn't need your permission to beat.

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My love doesn't await your orders.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I said I won't marry Jiya, I mean I won't!

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are we clear?

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
