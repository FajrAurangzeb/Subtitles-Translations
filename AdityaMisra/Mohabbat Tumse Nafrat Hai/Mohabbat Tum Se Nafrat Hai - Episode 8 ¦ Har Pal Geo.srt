1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,227
In that case, I admit that I love you.

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,950
I can't pay the bill; I left my wallet at home.

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,177
Don't worry.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,443
I'll pay the bill.

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,578
Muck!

6
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,201
He hasn't lost the match.

7
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,028
The blighter's lost his heart.

8
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,498
Hey.

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,400
Do I look like I'm lying?

10
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,254
I swear, I'm trying to forget his disappearance

11
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,244
And think about his running away.

12
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,659
Remember how he darted?

13
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,711
Just...

14
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,974
Like Runaway Groom, you get it?

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,048
Anyway.

16
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,070
That's one quandary sorted out.

17
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,241
Quandary?

18
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,741
As in?

19
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,191
He's found someone too.

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,007
He's not like that.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,108
Then what's he like?

22
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,489
Blow me pink!

23
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:22,289
So <i>you</i>'d tell Kaneez Begum who's like what!

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,278
Do you see my hair?

25
00:02:27,498 --> 00:02:28,690
Aye.

26
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,710
The greys reflect experience.

27
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:36,522
I knew it when the lad ran

28
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,791
Where he was headed.

29
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,241
He won't go there.

30
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,572
I can give it in writing.

31
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:44,043
It's not as if these blacks reflect inexperience.

32
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:47,154
Have some shame, you're talking to Ammi Begum.

33
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:51,484
Please don't intervene; we're having a Gang meeting.

34
00:02:51,645 --> 00:02:53,025
Aye.

35
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,520
Stay out of it.

36
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:58,731
We're all equals in the Gang.

37
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,880
And you, Chief?

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,657
What do you think?

39
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,028
I also knew when the lad ran

40
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:09,931
Where he was headed.

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,218
What did she say as she left?

42
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,429
The same as you.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,937
No, my dear.

44
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:29,837
I meant something else entirely.

45
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,328
Anyway.

46
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,420
The meeting is adjourned.

47
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,752
I like one thing about you.

48
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:55,394
You're a boy, yet you don't believe in part-time affairs.

49
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,766
By George!

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,497
You're from London, aren't you?

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,640
I used to live in London,

52
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,711
But I'm back now.

53
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,730
So,

54
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,991
Didn't you have affairs there?

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,920
To be frank, there sure was this itch in the beginning.

56
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,974
Then, it was almost as if someone had whispered to me,

57
00:04:18,974 --> 00:04:22,098
'Love the one you talk love to'.

58
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,502
'Don't besmirch the name of love with your "affairs".'

59
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,802
And I never use this term 'love affair'.

60
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,429
I think

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,700
Affairs can never be love

62
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,168
And love can never be an affair.

63
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,880
Sit down.

64
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,848
Jiya...

65
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,928
What's the time? I think I'm getting late.

66
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,865
Are you a girl?

67
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,588
Girls in Pakistan talk like this.

68
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,248
'It's getting late',

69
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,690
'Dad will be back',

70
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,851
'Please let me go'.

71
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,631
I like your sense of humour.

72
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,924
Maheen will never understand.

73
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,852
What?

74
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,918
That you don't despise her.

75
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:15,148
Come on, mate.

76
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,638
I don't despise her; she despises me.

77
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,629
I could've hit a six on the first ball.

78
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,749
But I just kept on batting through her balls.

79
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,686
I just want her to win, but

80
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,365
I don't want her to despise me.

81
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,206
She doesn't despise you, Waqar.

82
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,737
She loves you.

83
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,833
Shut up, mate.

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,976
If she starts loving me, Gulrez's curses will kill me.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,648
It just can't be.

86
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:55,120
If she's forgiven one murder, she'd kill me right away.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,410
And you?

88
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,991
If you're forgiven one murder, who would you kill?

89
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,792
Don't even <i>think</i> about it.

90
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,163
I can't even kill an ant.

91
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,304
You just did.

92
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,337
I said something trivial and you crushed this ant under its weight...

93
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,507
Blimey...

94
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,808
Anyway, tell me...

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,998
If you're convinced that Maheen doesn't love you,

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,298
Who would you love?

97
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,058
What's this guff?

98
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,349
Tell me.

99
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:39,150
Would you love someone?

100
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,038
Of course, mate.

101
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,690
I'm just waiting, Jiya.

102
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,788
And you know what,

103
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,007
I get a feeling that love is in the air...

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,348
Who is it?

105
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:54,849
I just got this feeling...

106
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,739
Not the name.

107
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:58,900
I think

108
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,908
She's headed for me.

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,138
I think you don't believe it.

110
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:09,828
I believe it.

111
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,021
Alright then.

112
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,896
No more conversations about Maheen.

113
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,320
And I can give it in writing, it can never be Maheen.

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,682
I mean she's Gulrez's.

115
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,937
Maheen!

116
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:37,989
Listen to me.

117
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,818
I'm not having an affair with Jiya.

118
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,260
Why are you telling <i>me</i>?

119
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,478
Thought you ought to know.

120
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,619
Listen...

121
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,828
I don't give a hoot what you do or don't do.

122
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,183
But aye, I'd like to tell you one thing -

123
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,021
If you make a place for yourself in a girl's heart, learn to stay there.

124
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,661
You don't learn this so easily in London,

125
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,862
But girl's hearts are not leaseholds

126
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:06,734
That you can leave at your leisure.

127
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,949
Sometimes, I'm afraid of you, Gulrez.

128
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,418
Why?

129
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,028
Dad said,

130
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,043
'When he turns 24, get him married'.

131
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,610
Why are you smiling?

132
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,601
Because I'm 25.

133
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,672
And you'll be 26 this December.

134
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:52,672
And 27 the next December.

135
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,001
So d'you want me to just keep counting years?

136
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,647
Tell me.

137
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,227
What can I do?

138
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:04,667
Talk to Maheen today itself

139
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:07,564
Or look for another girl.

140
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,867
Why --

141
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,611
Why is Wali <i>here</i> reading a book?

142
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,490
What's it to you if he's reading here?

143
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,128
Everything's according to a plan, right?

144
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,989
Wali doesn't usually read here.

145
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,733
You scallywag!

146
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,939
Why are you dragging me in?

147
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,726
That's quite the mouthful.

148
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,141
Now he's going to start too.

149
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:37,432
But please let me finish it by saying one thing.

150
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:40,082
I haven't got a second option.

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,748
Okay.

152
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:45,440
But what if

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,808
<i>She</i>'s got one?

154
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,538
Big deal, bud!

155
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:52,740
We'll attend her wedding.

156
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,830
Dancing, singing, feasting all the way!

157
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,839
What else d'you want?

158
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,880
And <i>you</i> won't get married.

159
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,641
Blooming Mark Antony!

160
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,332
I'll convince her.

161
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:06,149
Tomorrow, if not today; if not tomorrow --
-Never. If not tomorrow, <i>never</i>.

162
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,841
Not a moment after tomorrow.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,961
Convince her

164
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,968
Or give me a second option.

165
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,598
See?

166
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,151
I didn't utter a word.

167
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,588
Maheen...

168
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,879
I'm not having an affair with Jiya.

169
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,299
Mlle Jiya rang up the intercom

170
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,590
And said she's outside.

171
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,830
She asked me to tell Waqar

172
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,968
That if he didn't come out in two minutes,

173
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,938
She's coming in...

174
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,650
Read them?

175
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,067
Aye.

176
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,551
There's countless more.

177
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,238
Tell me, what do I do?

178
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,798
It's simple.

179
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,308
Just tell him to talk to Maheen.

180
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,828
And get married to her.

181
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,540
It's no joke.

182
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,128
I agree

183
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:28,178
It's no joke.

184
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:33,518
But what's happening is a complete farce.

185
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:38,109
We're surrounded by threats.

186
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,140
You're his sister.

187
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:44,644
You claim to know him well.

188
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,567
But the truth is

189
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,928
<i>I</i> know him far better than you.

190
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,338
We laugh at his love for his Foxy.

191
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,570
Deep down, we don't laugh.

192
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,688
We're ashamed

193
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,928
That our commitment to love isn't as pure.

194
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,354
He'd die for Maheen,

195
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,760
And you create this illusion of another girl to keep him alive

196
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,111
Trying to change his heart.

197
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,330
But he knows only too well

198
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,858
That you can only love one.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,807
And her name is Maheen Aurangzeb.

200
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,518
None but her.

201
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,531
Love is an affliction...

202
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,968
This vaurien often seeks a place

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,558
Where it is de trop.

204
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,187
I have always learnt something new from him.

205
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,860
Sometimes,

206
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,769
Loving like him,

207
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:32,993
And sometimes, beaming in pain like him,

208
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,179
And sometimes...

209
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,480
Weeping like him,

210
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,512
Without the trace of a tear in the eyes...

211
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,088
I'm afraid of him, Neelam.

212
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,719
People like him

213
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,131
Always get love,

214
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,358
But rarely, if ever,

215
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,458
The one they love.

216
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,178
How can it be anger over the match?

217
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:16,678
Dado had said that Maheen's team won.

218
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,898
So?

219
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,208
What's she angry about?

220
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:24,163
Your little escapade with Jiya

221
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:25,903
Probably that.

222
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,759
I think she's angry because you left the match and ran away.

223
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,700
But Fajr has another point of view.

224
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,728
Scares you, doesn't it?

225
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,569
Aye.

226
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,797
Why did you have to ruffle her then?

227
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:49,573
What with just two balls left?

228
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,224
You could've just played 'em... Gone for the sixes!

229
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,004
Before going for her.

230
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:56,225
Anyways what's done's been done.

231
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,305
Tell her --

232
00:16:57,305 --> 00:16:59,356
We can play again today.

233
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,791
Forget the chance of her playing cricket with you.

234
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:07,316
Maheen Aurangzeb doesn't play cricket with deserters.

235
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,729
I'm sorry but that's her line.

236
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:13,898
Alright.

237
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,978
As if I'm too interested!

238
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,878
Watch what you say.

239
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,789
Who knows, someone might just tell her.

240
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,360
Who will tell her? Who's here except you?

241
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,509
Why, I would, of course.

242
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,490
I can't keep a secret for more than two days.

243
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,300
Get up.

244
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,442
Get up,

245
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,273
Get out.

246
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,644
I said get up!

247
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:40,190
Big mistake!

248
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,839
Asking the Chief's right hand man to get out?

249
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,120
Meh!

250
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,822
Sir 'Chief's right hand'!

251
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,580
Sissy's wimpish skivvy.

252
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,878
Bog off!

253
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,428
You're taking me lightly.

254
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,009
Wait.

255
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,870
Now you're talking.

256
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,078
Wh --

257
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,387
What'd Fajr say?

258
00:18:02,387 --> 00:18:03,957
Why's she angry?

259
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,577
Nothing, really.

260
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,228
She was just guessing.

261
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,569
But you know what?

262
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:10,030
Maheen says,

263
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,231
Between the two of us, Fajr's the less intelligent!

264
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:15,237
Oh.

265
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,439
Go, now!

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,778

272
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,313
Hi!

273
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,520
Hi!

274
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,768
What brings you here?

275
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,968
The same as you.

276
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,892
Oh really. I come here everyday.

277
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,170
What am I seeing today?

278
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,090
My thoughts brought you here?

279
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,096
You think of those who have become distant.

280
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,869
I see you around here every now and then.

281
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,409
C'mon.

282
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,008
Good morning!

283
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:42,648
Good morning.

284
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,948
Where's Mum?

285
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,140
She left for Nano's.

286
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,208
But today's Sunday!

287
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,418
It's not about Sunday.

288
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,518
It's because <i>she</i> took Waqar along.

289
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:55,209
Your Jiya.

290
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,399
So Nano's thought

291
00:19:57,399 --> 00:19:58,978
About both of them.

292
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,368
What?

293
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,041
She said, 'The girl's nice and beautiful'.

294
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,786
'Why not get the couple married'?

295
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,088
What happened?

296
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,808
What could happen?

297
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,928
I was thinking --

298
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,072
Jiya's so nice...

299
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,787
And Waqar's a proper London tramp.

300
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,536
It doesn't quite fit.

301
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:28,047
Whether it fits or not, they love each other!

302
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:30,390
They don't; I know.

303
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,668
Jiya's not interested in him.

304
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,859
She's just -- his friend.

305
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,280
How long does it take for a friend to become a wife?

306
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,380
It takes just one attempt.

307
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,615
Attempt?

308
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,430
Just one 'I love you', Sherlock!

309
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,349
What else do you call it?

310
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,746
Oh.

311
00:20:47,272 --> 00:20:48,652
Let them get married.

312
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,592
As if I give a hoot.

313
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,596
I know it very well.

314
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,340
Honestly, Jiya and Waqar look wonderful together.

315
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,568
That's good.

316
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:59,519
That's two weddings this season.

317
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,168
It's gonna be <i>so</i> fun!

318
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:02,898
Who's the other one?

319
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,989
You, of course.

320
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,090
Shut up!

321
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,418
Why? Won't you get married?

322
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,458
And if so, why don't you tell everyone?

323
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,465
Why are you standing here like that?

324
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,429
What?

325
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:14,960
'Standing here like this'?

326
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,981
You blabbering blighter!

327
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,018
Pull my leg all you want.

328
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:38,039
You're just proving your friendship with her.

329
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,359
Sorry mate.

330
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,969
You took it seriously.

331
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:43,140
Not me; she's serious, you twit.

332
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,219
About who?

333
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,150
You?

334
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,860
Jiya, please. Don't start.

335
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,110
This isn't a time for jokes.

336
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,329
I'm not joking.

337
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,161
She's engaged to Gulrez. He'd die for her!

338
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:55,826
That witch is after me like crazy!

339
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:58,617
You say it like you don't deserve it!

340
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:00,138
Do you even know what happened?

341
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:01,009
I do.

342
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,449
You slapped her.

343
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:05,050
And she told the world about it!

344
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,938
No idea about the world.

345
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:10,249
But I'm her closest friend. I know everything.

346
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,239
Jiya... I thought you were sensible.

347
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,040
'<i>Thought</i>'?

348
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,120
I mean, if you knew everything,

349
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,108
Why didn't you tell her how wrong she was?

350
00:22:20,153 --> 00:22:24,064
Easy, mate. Kids make mistakes.

351
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:25,347
Kids?

352
00:22:25,347 --> 00:22:28,893
As if she was an infant four years ago!

353
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,590
It's been four years but she remembers it as if it was just yesterday!

354
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,638
What are you looking at?

355
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,559
Mind if I ask you something?

356
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:41,930
Not at all.

357
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,088
Do you feel bad that she still remembers the slap,

358
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,769
Or that she ignores you?

359
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,348
Excuse me, who is she?

360
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:54,967
What do I care if she ignores me?

361
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,078
Dado's emboldened her, or...

362
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,331
Or?

363
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,913
Or another slap would bring her back to her senses.

364
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,787
Really?

365
00:23:04,878 --> 00:23:06,720
Lemme vent it out in words, mate...

366
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,989
Loser!

367
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,539
She may be a bit on the impish side...

368
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,988
A bit on the rowdy side, too...

369
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:22,379
Our Maheen's on the rowdy side too...

370
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,439
Plus, she's Maheen's friend...

371
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,010
She looks good.

372
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,898
I think...

373
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,857
She'd do.

374
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,907
Do what?

375
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,528
There, now...

376
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:52,459
She'd do for Waqar like you did for Mehrunnisa.

377
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,049
Oh...

378
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,599
So that's what it's about.

379
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,259
What do you think?

380
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,657
Whatever you think.

381
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,501
I didn't ask <i>you</i>.

382
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,008
I'm asking Suraiyya and Mehrunnisa.

383
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,018
I say she'd do.

384
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,130
And guess who's here!

385
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,240
Come here.

386
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,018
Hiya, Dado.

387
00:24:22,688 --> 00:24:25,348
Good morning to you, too.

388
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,338
Tea?

389
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,140
You'll get anything you want, m'lad.

390
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,888
In fact...

391
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:44,798
You'd even get

392
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:47,198
Whoever you want.

393
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:49,629
Why are we talking about that?

394
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,688
We're just talking about her...

395
00:24:55,239 --> 00:25:00,880
You've been seeing her, meeting her, my dear...

396
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:03,080
Just...

397
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:06,380
Tell me

398
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,798
If you've had <i>the talk</i>.

399
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:12,188
What talk?

400
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,510
Oh, nothing, just the gewgaws of marriage...

401
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,475
Whose marriage?

402
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,026
Splendid.

403
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,507
My lad's learnt acting in London.

404
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:29,437
Dado...

405
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:30,889
Oh, please...

406
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,748
Let me talk.

407
00:25:35,378 --> 00:25:37,878
Give me her address.

408
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:43,498
You'd better. Or I'll ask Maheen.

409
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,699
Ask her what?

410
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,890
Please, Dado, tell me something.

411
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,858
She's talking about Jiya.

412
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,857
Dastoor Ahmed!

413
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,618
Alright...

414
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:03,227
Now that it's in the open,

415
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:06,557
Give me her address and number.

416
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:09,838
Let me talk to her

417
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:12,608
Before her parents.

418
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,007
What'll you talk about?

419
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:19,047
Is that coyness

420
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:22,649
Or you trying to fool everyone?

421
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,918
Dado, by the L --
-Don't swear.

422
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,298
I like her.

423
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,829
I've even looked at your stars.

424
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:40,360
Seen the omens, too.

425
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:43,239
It's a match made in Heaven.

426
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,830
Are you even hearing what you say?

427
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,058
When did I say I want to marry Jiya?

428
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:52,778
So are you just gadding about with her?

429
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,038
You think Karachi's anything like London, you twit?

430
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,867
It is how it is.

431
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:07,858
When a girl would be caught enjoying herself with someone,

432
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:12,458
The elders would get her married to him.

433
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,088
In short,

434
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,058
You've been caught.

435
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:28,089
'Caught'? If she's my friend -- and she grabbed my hand -- you'd say I've been 'caught gadding about'?

436
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,530
No!

437
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,170
I'm not the type!

438
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,490
So?

439
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,877
No way I'm marrying Jiya.

440
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,668
Who, then?

441
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,628
Anyone but Jiya.

442
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,020
Hold on to the railing.

443
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,748
Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.

444
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:10,829
I'm not.

445
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,087
Step up onto the railing.

446
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,628
Why was Nano rubbing her hands?

447
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,027
I didn't ask.

448
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:27,178
Ali just said she started rubbing her hands when it was all over.

449
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,018
Her face was drained of all colour.

450
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:33,568
Splendid...

451
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:36,588
Turn up the volume.

452
00:28:36,678 --> 00:28:37,779
No.

453
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,680
Let me think.

454
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,908
If he says he won't marry Jiya...

455
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,838
What's the problem?

456
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,780
He must be after some English rose.

457
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,490
He'd marry her.

458
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,218
Aye. That's why Ammi Begum's troubled.

459
00:28:52,278 --> 00:28:52,988
Hey!

460
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:54,308
What's wrong with that?

461
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:57,249
He can bring his English rose if he wants.

462
00:28:57,608 --> 00:28:59,499
It's all about the heart, Fajr.

463
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,980
It's all about Ammi Begum's honour, Maheen.

464
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,250
Ammi Begum's as good as dead if he brought his English rose.

465
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,591
How come?

466
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,690
Wouldn't she die if she heard English all day?

467
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,571
She'd much rather kill someone!

468
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:14,461
Honestly, though,

469
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,550
If he wasn't interested in Jiya,

470
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,698
Why was he dating her?

471
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,858
Hey! She's his friend.

472
00:29:22,858 --> 00:29:23,869
Oh, please.

473
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,920
Boys and girls are never <i>just</i> friends.

474
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,058
Oh?

475
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,260
Never knew you were so conservative.

476
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,949
Let me tell you.

477
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,741
Those who tell the truth are conservative.

478
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,028
Boys are always ready to prowl in 'friendship'.

479
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:42,848
The moment her guard's down, she goes down.

480
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,148
Call Jiya.

481
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,178
Why?

482
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,326
Ask her

483
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,387
What she'd do if Waqar proposed to her.

484
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:53,120
She'd accept it, of course.

485
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,839
Let's just ask her.

486
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,489
Give me the phone.

487
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,228
The number you've dialled is busy...

488
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:04,759
It's busy.

489
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,130
Bet she's talking to him.

490
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:25,551
We were on the plane together. Had a chat, became friends.

491
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,269
And?

492
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:30,919
We know about your friendship.

493
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,259
Go on.

494
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,100
Go on about what?

495
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,981
Haven't fallen in love yet, eh?

496
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:40,102
No!

497
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,851
But of course...

498
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:51,430
He must've told you he's in touch with the ladies of London.

499
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,571
He isn't in touch with anyone.

500
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,779
He's your ordinary boy-next-door.

501
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:59,959
He just says that to tease you.

502
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,368
Look...

503
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,308
You better tell me the truth.

504
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:06,811
I'm very happy.

505
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,309
Otherwise...

506
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,409
Please, be happy.

507
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,528
He's very good.

508
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,888
If he is...

509
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,238
Marry him.

510
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,040
I swear, you look so good with him.

511
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,121
What are you saying?

512
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm playing matchmaker.

513
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,519
But he never --

514
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:34,780
I mean...

515
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:37,320
It never felt that...

516
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,111
The blighter's like the East India Company.

517
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,639
Who could see they were here to plunder everything?

518
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:52,328
I just caught him red-handed.

519
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,790
I could see he's got his eyes on you.

520
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,558
So,

521
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,088
Who have you got with you?

522
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,458
My Dad.

523
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,878
Give me his number.

524
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,808
I need to see him tomorrow.

525
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:15,418
No, Ammi Begum. It's nothing like that.

526
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,458
Did you ask him?

527
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,219
Tell me about yourself.

528
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,188
What do you think?

529
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,509
Ask him first.

530
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:30,239
If he agrees,

531
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,410
So will I.

532
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,411
Then, let me tell you.

533
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,958
I accept it on his behalf.

534
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,939
Give me your Dad's number.

535
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,471
You can't believe it, can you?

536
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,401
Not at all.

537
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,469
I'm coming with the ring tomorrow.

538
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,390
I'll put it on you myself!

539
00:32:56,404 --> 00:32:58,344
<i>You</i> would?

540
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:06,315
Have some shame, dear. Back in our day, Mums and Grannies used to do these things.

541
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,380
I'll give you his number.

542
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:09,912
Promise me...

543
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:12,103
You'll bring him.

544
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,959
You may put the ring on me,

545
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:18,629
But do so before him.

546
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,488
Alright.

547
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:25,379
I promise you. I'll put the ring on you before him.

548
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,748
So,

549
00:33:28,077 --> 00:33:29,969
Tell me what you say.

550
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:32,210
I'll send you the number.

551
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,948
Dastoor Ahmed!

552
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,738
Mehrunnisa! Where are you?

553
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,638
Over here!

554
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:13,788
I've got news.

555
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,328
What happened, Ammi Begum?

556
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,860
Everything alright?

557
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:30,237
Not <i>just</i> alright!

558
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,928
Take a seat.

559
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:40,088
You may just trip and fall if you heard it.

560
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,858
She said yes.

561
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:55,058
Who?

562
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,669
Why don't you ask me?

563
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:01,400
Yes, Ammi Begum?

564
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,974
Who?

565
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,763
Jiya.

566
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,430
What did she say yes to?

567
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,408
The proposal about her and Waqar's marriage!

568
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:15,148
As if theirs is any match!

569
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,929
What's that guff?

570
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,018
He was swearing

571
00:35:24,128 --> 00:35:26,793
That he isn't interested in Jiya.

572
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,779
He won't marry Jiya.

573
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,900
Is he having second thoughts?

574
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,978
He won't, Ammi Begum.

575
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:44,838
He was stressing it so much.

576
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:47,398
I understood him.

577
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,008
Over there.

578
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,377
He's coming.

579
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,060
Ask him yourself.

580
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,787
See whether he stands firm or agrees to marry Jiya.

581
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,318
Wait a minute, my sweetie.

582
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,927
Come here.

583
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,378
Let me give you the news too.

584
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,779
Aye?

585
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,538
Talked to Jiya?

586
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,901
I mean...

587
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,981
Didn't she call you?

588
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,032
She did.

589
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:20,910
She's been calling for the last 15 minutes.

590
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:24,118
So, m'lad, just talk to her, will you?

591
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,328
Must be something important.

592
00:36:28,308 --> 00:36:32,588
Nobody tries continuously for 15 minutes for nothing.

593
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,940
When did she grow so much on you?

594
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,261
She's such a close friend of Maheen's.

595
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:41,141
That makes her

596
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,885
Just like Maheen to me.

597
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:46,768
Good night.

598
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:49,049
Not so fast, you twit.

599
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,627
Spouting English and running away, eh?

600
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,842
We're going to her place tomorrow.

601
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:02,082
And...

602
00:37:02,391 --> 00:37:05,962
Here's her Dad's number.

603
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,718
I've asked for her hand in marriage.

604
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:15,688
I'll talk to her Dad tomorrow and formalise it.

605
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,030
If he accepts the proposal,

606
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,010
I'll put the ring on her myself!

607
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,754
Before you.

608
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,770
You may do it yourself if you want.

609
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,360
I won't mind it one bit.

610
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,791
What in the world is your problem?

611
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,340
What do you think I am?

612
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:40,389
A blimming circus-monkey who'd dance to your tunes?

613
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,998
Do you think I'd start loving Jiya because you ordered me to?

614
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:48,789
That I'd marry her if you put a ring on her?

615
00:37:50,429 --> 00:37:52,150
As if hearts beat

616
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,758
Or love by your will!

617
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,918
When I said I won't marry Jiya, I mean I won't!

618
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,207
Are we clear?

619
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,910
Ammi Begum!

620
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
