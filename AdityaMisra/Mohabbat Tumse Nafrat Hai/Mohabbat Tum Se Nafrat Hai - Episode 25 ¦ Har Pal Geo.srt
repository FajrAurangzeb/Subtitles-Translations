1
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:17,456
She even read the letter,

2
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:22,815
And read it out, too.

3
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,816
But

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:30,801
Not a tear fell from her eyes.

5
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,430
Just...

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,956
Ammi Begum...

7
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:40,566
She didn't weep, either,

8
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,284
But it felt as if

9
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:48,518
The light had gone out of her.

10
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,638
Nano?

11
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,468
It's nothing, Nano...

12
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,732
He must be mithering!

13
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:02,295
He'll be coming anytime.

14
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,427
Ammi Begum!

15
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,504
Right, I'm fine...

16
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:17,356
He's --

17
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:21,997
Saying he'll be coming.

18
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:30,330
Where's he gone?

19
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,985
He won't be going anywhere!

20
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,814
Don't ask such absurd questions!

21
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:40,393
The blighter's just up to some buffoonery!

22
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:42,251
Nano,

23
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,946
Get up!

24
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:48,494
It appears you've been run out!

25
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:55,063
Surely, she's laughing, Ammi Begum?

26
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,804
She's crying, you twit!

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,950
She's just putting up a show of laughter.

28
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:15,896
What's this letter?

29
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:19,287
He's sent me a letter.

30
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,029
A love letter!

31
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:22,905
Show me.

32
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,607
No way!

33
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:31,355
You'd read your daughter's love letters now?

34
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:35,855
Is this the time to write love letters?

35
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:46,267
Get the guests something to eat.

36
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,767
He'll be -- A tad late.

37
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:54,493
That's what he's written?

38
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:00,569
Should I call him?

39
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,186
His phone's switched off...

40
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:11,775
Honestly, Maheen,

41
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,232
What has happened?

42
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:17,182
It kills me!

43
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:24,588
May I tell the truth, Nano?

44
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:29,150
It kills me, too.

45
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,573
The blighter's fled, leaving me...

46
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:43,660
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,347
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

48
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:57,801
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

49
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:06,161
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i>

50
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:11,597
<i>Who break our heart</i>

51
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:14,517
Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum?

52
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:06,042
We apologise for hurting you with this indecorum;

53
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:07,949
The fact is

54
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,526
A problem's come up.

55
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,182
My groom,

56
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:15,920
Waqar Mashood Ahmed,

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,468
Has left me and fled.

58
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:34,052
It's almost 11 p.m.

59
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,762
We'll wait for him till 12.

60
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:41,318
Don't misconstrue this wait to mean that we're looking for him.

61
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:45,164
Not at all!

62
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:52,394
To look for recreant deserters is not a custom we practice.

63
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,646
One who's gone

64
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,693
Is gone.

65
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:59,050
We just say,

66
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,878
'May God keep him happy'.

67
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:11,462
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

68
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:14,558
I know he's not coming.

69
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:18,091
But, just in case...

70
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:22,865
Therefore, we'll wait until 12.

71
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,948
You may wait until 12 if you please,

72
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:30,650
Or have dinner and leave.

73
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,008
I'm saying all of this

74
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:46,055
On behalf of Kaneez Begum.

75
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,693
What it is is,

76
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,024
She's a tad woeful,

77
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:57,443
So she can't talk.

78
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:12,632
This apology of mine with folded hands...

79
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:18,773
Take it that Kaneez Begum is apologising.

80
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,877
Dastoor Uncle,

81
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:33,714
Ask Munshi Alam to serve the guests dinner in the lawn.

82
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:37,740
I'll be coming shortly.

83
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,817
Listen, Maheen!

84
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,552
Why did you say,

85
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:14,490
'We won't be looking for him'?

86
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,536
Because we won't be looking for him.

87
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:21,709
Alright, tell me,

88
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,177
Does love need one to look for someone?

89
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:27,317
And, if you do go looking,

90
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:31,696
Do you ever find someone?

91
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:37,609
You tried looking and lost;

92
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:40,158
I was right there by you,

93
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,599
But you couldn't get me.

94
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:49,798
That's not how it is, partner!

95
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:53,212
If one deserts in love,

96
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:56,914
Or loses his way,

97
00:08:56,914 --> 00:09:02,454
Then, one who searches for him is a sinner!

98
00:09:56,989 --> 00:10:02,551
Apparently you've turned into a Molvi the moment that twit's left!

99
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,933
Pronouncing judgements like that!

100
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:06,568
It's truly exhilarating, Nano!

101
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:11,175
What a twist it is he's given this story!

102
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:19,897
You're weeping, aren't you?

103
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:22,176
Not at all, Nano!

104
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:25,620
He'd be cursed if I wept.

105
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,333
I'd actually fallen for the dastard!

106
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,276
No!

107
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:37,437
May he

108
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,792
Remain happy wherever he is.

109
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:42,792
What about you?

110
00:10:44,789 --> 00:10:46,497
He'd said the same!

111
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:50,311
'What about you, Maheen'?

112
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:52,074
That's brilliant, partner.

113
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:53,459
You do

114
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,180
Exactly what you say!

115
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,796
What are you looking at?

116
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:13,908
Sit.

117
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,188
Have some juice

118
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,008
And tell me

119
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:20,473
What I should do.

120
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,270
Please, Ammi Begum, sit.

121
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,320
Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum!

122
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:23,043
What happened when the clock finally struck 12, Munshi Alam?

123
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,306
Please, go on.

124
00:12:27,592 --> 00:12:31,706
She never let the clock strike 12.

125
00:12:31,706 --> 00:12:32,710
Suddenly,

126
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,713
'Climp, clomp',

127
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:38,505
Echoed her footfalls as she descended the stairs.

128
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:41,978
Everybody's eyes were on her.

129
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,273
Who knows

130
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:49,362
Who it was that she was looking at!

131
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:52,659
Perhaps she was searching for someone.

132
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:56,833
Who are you searching for, Maheen?

133
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,406
Gulrez.

134
00:12:58,406 --> 00:12:59,784
Where is he?

135
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,489
In Ali's room.

136
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,713
He's sitting with Ali and Fajr.

137
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:07,587
Uncle,

138
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:11,959
Please don't go anywhere.

139
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,631
And ask Molvi Sahab to sit.

140
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:20,441
The bridegroom's coming.

141
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:47,057
If I may say so, Gulrez,

142
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:52,007
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl.

143
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,168
She'd clobber him proper!

144
00:13:54,168 --> 00:14:00,168
How would one who couldn't forget a slap forget deserting her on the wedding day?

145
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,525
Why this corner meeting?

146
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:22,521
I'd heard

147
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:25,718
You're set to become the Chief.

148
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:27,936
Splendid.

149
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:29,703
Sitting in the Opposition,

150
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,162
Dreaming of ruling!

151
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
You can't.

152
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:43,282
I won't.

153
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,487
Good boy.

154
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:47,383
So, pray tell,

155
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:51,679
What were you talking about?

156
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,821
What are you looking at?

157
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:56,055
I'm your chief.

158
00:14:56,055 --> 00:15:00,085
Tell me what was going on.

159
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:03,541
I was saying

160
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:08,843
That he'd picked a fight with the wrong girl.

161
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:12,297
Yes!

162
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:15,744
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl, Fajr.

163
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:19,379
I'd clobber him proper!

164
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:20,470
Relax, Maheen.

165
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,814
Why don't you relax, mate?

166
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:23,599
And --

167
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,504
Be done with this corner meeting!

168
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:29,424
So what, if the enemy's fled?

169
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,711
You'll see when he shows up again,

170
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:35,164
I'll give him a piece of what he deserves!

171
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:38,499
I'll leech his blood!

172
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,064
I know.

173
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:49,441
I haven't forgotten his slap,

174
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:55,672
How could I forget him deserting me on the wedding day?

175
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:59,329
Will you help me?

176
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,642
Me?

177
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:03,928
Are you asking me?

178
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:05,738
Of course, partner!

179
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:07,111
Tell me,

180
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:08,688
Will you help me?

181
00:16:08,688 --> 00:16:12,685
You don't need to ask!
-Yes.

182
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,935
I will.

183
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:21,400
I haven't let the guests leave.

184
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,899
I've stopped Molvi Sahab too.

185
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,055
I've said, 'Wait',

186
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,977
'The bridegroom's coming'.

187
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,368
You got a call from him?

188
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,930
I didn't.

189
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,929
I got an idea.

190
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,906
Idea?

191
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,548
Have you had dinner?

192
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,769
Come on, Maheen?

193
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,173
As if I'd have anything with all the gloom in the ambience!

194
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:56,970
Surely, you would in an ambience of merrymaking?

195
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,787
Of course.

196
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:09,062
Hold my hand, then.

197
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,057
Take me to Molvi Sahab.

198
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,056
Ah, right,

199
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:28,610
I'd said I'd take you to him.

200
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:31,593
No, my sweet spoony,

201
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:35,291
I'm not having you sit by Molvi Sahab.

202
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:39,280
You'll be sitting by my side,

203
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,056
And saying,

204
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,509
'Molvi Sahab',

205
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:48,807
'Commence the nuptials'.

206
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:10,554
What are you thinking about?

207
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:15,755
Don't you love me?

208
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:20,814
Please help me, mate.

209
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:22,446
Let the blighter be stupefied

210
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:25,100
When he lands in London

211
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,728
As if

212
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:30,228
The life has gone out of him!

213
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:50,282
Do you love me?

214
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:51,607
You?

215
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:53,442
I don't even despise you.

216
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,976
Let alone the question of love, Monsieur.

217
00:18:54,976 --> 00:18:58,484
I'll ravish you from here.

218
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:37,944
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

219
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:47,382
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

220
00:18:47,382 --> 00:18:56,694
<i>I will remember you then,</i>

221
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:06,131
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

222
00:19:06,131 --> 00:19:10,866
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

223
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:20,244
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination,</i>

224
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:29,631
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

225
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:39,070
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

226
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:47,539
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i>

227
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:52,658
<i>Who break our heart</i>

228
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,304
Molvi Sahab,

229
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:20,724
Commence the nuptials.

230
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:30,222
Has the groom arrived?

231
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,379
He sits before you.

232
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:01,038
Madam,

233
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,727
Do I have your permission?

234
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,568
You may begin, Molvi Sahab.

235
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:15,201
Begin in the Lord's name.

236
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,461
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

237
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:37,476
All praise be to Him, the Lord of the worlds.

238
00:22:37,476 --> 00:22:39,587
And the consequence of the righteous

239
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:42,663
And peace and blessings be upon the Prophets and Messengers

240
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:47,054
The Prophet Mohammad and his family and companions.

241
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,159
That's good.

242
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,599
That's what was supposed to happen.

243
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,026
What?

244
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:03,784
What did you say?

245
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:08,900
Do you know, Munshi Alam, that she never wanted to marry me in the first place?

246
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,301
She loved Gulrez.

247
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:14,765
She just wanted to get even with me.

248
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:17,231
Ammi Begum very aptly said

249
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,746
That you inherit half her property

250
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:24,730
And the entirety of her odium.

251
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:29,253
I'm serving you an ultimatum until tomorrow.

252
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,254
Take the papers of the will,

253
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:36,966
And flit back to where you came from!

254
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,640
Munshi Alam!

255
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,237
Munshi Alam!

256
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,207
Look at this.

257
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,943
Read this.

258
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,990
I have proof.

259
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,254
Yes, she's left.

260
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:36,695
Vivified me

261
00:24:36,695 --> 00:24:40,893
With her touch, and left.

262
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,238
Yes.

263
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:47,974
Right.

264
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,302
Now I'm just waiting

265
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:55,433
To get up and start walking.

266
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,257
Come here sometime.

267
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:02,037
Show your face around here.

268
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,054
Leave that be.

269
00:25:06,054 --> 00:25:08,697
You say it,

270
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:12,616
And I listen quietly.

271
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,380
Alright, listen,

272
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,261
That blighter's around here these days.

273
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:28,948
Got wind of the will being drafted somehow,

274
00:25:28,948 --> 00:25:32,914
And showed up the very next day.

275
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,823
No.

276
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:38,703
Would I let him get in?

277
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:44,554
'Around here' as in, he's arrived in Karachi.

278
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:46,443
Yes,

279
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:51,542
He must be staying in one of those hotels.

280
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,268
He must have.

281
00:25:57,268 --> 00:26:00,377
He must have kids too.

282
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:12,493
What do you think I am?

283
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:15,815
Even if he showed up with his kids,

284
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:21,413
I won't let him get past the gates of Kaneez Mahal.

285
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,519
I've told the guards

286
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,828
That I don't care if a dog or a cat gets in,

287
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:32,424
But he must never be allowed in.

288
00:26:33,736 --> 00:26:37,719
Listen to the next one.

289
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:41,284
He paid a visit to me in my dream last night.

290
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:49,223
He fell at my feet, apologising; I, too, kicked him right in the stomach, saying,

291
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:55,986
'Don't you dare pay me a visit even in my dreams'!

292
00:26:55,986 --> 00:26:59,891
I'm talking to Fajr.

293
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,610
I'm going tomorrow.

294
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:28,606
Please, Munshi Alam, just tell me one thing.

295
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:32,868
She's happy, isn't she?

296
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,852
I mean,

297
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:40,265
The two of them are happy, aren't they?

298
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:46,836
Gulrez, too, sees me as the culprit?

299
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,060
There.

300
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:58,980
He knew that I was doing the right thing.

301
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,452
She's very good, too, Munshi Alam, but...

302
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:07,983
Putting up this façade of a marriage

303
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:12,417
To exact her revenge...

304
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:16,875
It was simply not cricket.

305
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:20,577
Trust me, Munshi Alam,

306
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:24,791
She was doing something very wrong.

307
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:29,784
Thank goodness I found out about it in time.

308
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:33,420
I felt like

309
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,947
Telling Gulrez everything,

310
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:43,525
But to be quite honest,

311
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:45,540
I'd begun suspecting

312
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,825
That Gulrez was in on it with Maheen.

313
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,290
At the very least, I can meet Gulrez, can't I?

314
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:11,228
First,

315
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:13,551
Have your tea.

316
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,489
We'll talk later.

317
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:18,473
Munshi Alam, why can't I meet Gulrez?

318
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:23,488
Because Gulrez is dead!

319
00:31:23,912 --> 00:31:27,191
Forgive me, mate.

320
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:29,530
Come on, Waqar,

321
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,333
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

322
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,401
That's not what it is.

323
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:40,645
I'm thoroughly delighted.

324
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:55,856
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

325
00:31:55,856 --> 00:32:10,549
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

326
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,500
Thank you.

327
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:35,478
What happened?

328
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,946
I'm seeing you smile after so many years.

329
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:43,571
How many years?

330
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:49,850
I felt as if I've never seen you smile widely or laugh.

331
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:53,648
I'm laughing now.

332
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:55,542
Why?

333
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,445
What's happened now?

334
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,653
I think you should go and pick up Daji from the school.

335
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:05,197
It's almost 12.

336
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:23,599
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

337
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,570
Is anybody there in the room?

338
00:34:41,506 --> 00:34:44,824
Give me your hand.

339
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:53,497
I want to touch and feel you.

340
00:34:55,637 --> 00:35:01,782
Did the two of us actually get married?

341
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:06,896
Did you say

342
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:11,837
'Yes' to my name?

343
00:35:11,837 --> 00:35:15,583
Did you say,

344
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,880
'I accept'

345
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,645
'Gulrez Akhtar',

346
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:26,192
'Son of Mehmood Akhtar'?

347
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:38,206
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

348
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,120
Yes...

349
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:48,263
This is the same hand

350
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:53,372
With which you'd write your diary;

351
00:35:50,640 --> 00:36:02,804
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

352
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:07,412
To me, it felt

353
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:11,758
As if you're writing my destiny...

354
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,537
I used to think

355
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:22,406
That my life would've been one well-spent

356
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:28,288
Once I held your hand,

357
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,694
And

358
00:36:30,694 --> 00:36:34,991
Sometimes, I'd feel

359
00:36:34,991 --> 00:36:40,836
That Death won't dare come near me

360
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:46,100
If I just seized your hand firmly.

361
00:36:57,188 --> 00:36:58,927
If you

362
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:02,625
Ever chance upon him --

363
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:05,405
Him --

364
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:10,036
Waqar Ahmed,

365
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:13,799
Tell him,

366
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,187
That as he departed,

367
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:22,712
Gulrez said 'Thank you' to him.

368
00:37:28,702 --> 00:37:32,979
Don't let go...

369
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,960
I'd die if you did...

370
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
