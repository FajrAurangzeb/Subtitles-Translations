1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,203
She read the letter,

2
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:19,779
Read it out, too.

3
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,619
But

4
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,259
Not a tear fell from her eyes.

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,038
Just...

6
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:34,019
Ammi Begum...

7
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:39,138
She didn't weep, either,

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,399
But it felt as if

9
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:45,928
The light had gone out of her.

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,345
Nano?

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,507
It's nothing, Nano...

12
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:58,347
He must be mithering us!

13
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,687
He'll be here anytime.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,302
Ammi Begum!

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,558
Right, I'm fine...

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,121
He's --

17
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,941
Saying he'll be coming.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,120
Where's he gone?

19
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,790
He won't be going anywhere!

20
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,450
Don't ask such absurd questions!

21
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,650
The blighter's just up to some buffoonery!

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,821
Nano,

23
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,601
Get up!

24
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:46,674
It appears you've been run out!

25
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,248
Surely, she's laughing, Ammi Begum?

26
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:57,380
She's crying, you twit!

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
She's just putting up a show of laughter.

28
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,989
What's this letter?

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,910
He's sent me a letter.

30
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,649
A love letter!

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,243
Show me.

32
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,131
No way!

33
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,321
You'd read your daughter's love letters now?

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,708
Is this the time to write love letters?

35
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,377
Get the guests something to eat.

36
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:48,697
He'll be -- A tad late.

37
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,649
That's what he's written?

38
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,310
Should I call him?

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,038
His phone's switched off...

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,008
Honestly, Maheen,

41
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:12,931
What has happened?

42
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,412
It kills me!

43
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,548
In truth, Nano...

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,708
It kills me, too.

45
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,030
The blighter's fled, leaving me...

46
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,719
The blighter's fled, leaving me...

Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum?

53
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,570
We apologise for hurting you with this indecorum;

54
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,631
The fact is

55
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,941
A problem's come up.

56
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:11,901
My groom,

57
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,471
Waqar Mashood Ahmed,

58
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,904
Has left me and fled.

59
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:31,255
It's almost 11 p.m.

60
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,820
We'll wait for him till 12.

61
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,098
Don't misconstrue this wait to mean that we're looking for him.

62
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:42,838
Not at all!

63
00:05:44,948 --> 00:05:49,198
To look for recreant deserters is not a custom we practice.

64
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,470
One who's gone

65
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,980
Is gone.

66
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,830
We just say,

67
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,451
'May God keep him happy'.

68
00:06:00,451 --> 00:06:01,791
'May God keep him happy'.
♪ <i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you...</i> ♪

69
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:11,169
♪ <i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you...</i> ♪

70
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,921
I know he's not coming.

71
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,061
But we'll wait until 12...

72
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,080
Just in case...

73
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,728
You may wait until 12 if you please,

74
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:28,500
Or have dinner and leave.

75
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,733
I'm saying all of this

76
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,758
On behalf of Kaneez Begum.

77
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,200
What it is is,

78
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,631
She's a tad woeful,

79
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:55,419
So she can't talk.

80
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:07,950
This apology of mine with folded hands...

81
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,739
Take it that Kaneez Begum is apologising.

82
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,758
Uncle Dastoor,

83
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,680
Ask Munshi Alam to serve the guests dinner in the lawn.

84
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,938
I'll be coming shortly.

85
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,333
Listen, Maheen!

86
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,658
Why did you say,

87
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:12,868
'We won't be looking for him'?

88
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,968
Because we won't be looking for him.

89
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,608
Alright, tell me,

90
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:23,949
Does love need one to look for someone?

91
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:26,109
And, if you do go looking,

92
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,428
Do you ever find someone?

93
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,928
You tried looking and lost;

94
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:39,692
I was right there by you,

95
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,402
But you couldn't get me.

96
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:47,802
That's not how it is, partner!

97
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:52,192
If one deserts in love,

98
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,949
Or loses his way,

99
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,711
The one who searches for him is a sinner!

100
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:02,088
So you've turned into a Reverend the moment that twit's left!

101
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,603
Pronouncing judgements like that!

102
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,378
It's truly exhilarating, Nano!

103
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:09,308
What a twist he's given this story!

104
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,837
You're weeping, aren't you?

105
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,767
Not at all, Nano!

106
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,760
He'd be cursed if I wept.

107
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,339
I'd actually fallen for the dastard!

108
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,410
No!

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,359
May he

110
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,370
Remain happy wherever he is.

111
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,971
What about you?

112
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,311
Blimey...

113
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,360
That's what he said too!

114
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,919
'What about you, Maheen'?

115
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,790
Way to go, partner.

116
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,317
You do

117
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,468
Exactly what you say!

118
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,567
What are you looking at?

119
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,700
Sit.

120
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,961
Have some juice

121
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,831
And tell me

122
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,966
What I should do.

123
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,021
Please, Ammi Begum, sit.

124
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,902
Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum!

125
00:12:18,758 --> 00:12:22,038
What happened when the clock finally struck 12, Munshi Alam?

126
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,798
Please, go on.

127
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:30,499
She never let the clock strike 12.

128
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:32,578
Suddenly,

129
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:33,569
'Climp, clomp',

130
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:37,160
Echoed her footfalls as she descended the stairs.

131
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,270
Everybody's eyes were fixed on her.

132
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,030
Who knows

133
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,921
Who it was that she was looking at...

134
00:12:49,152 --> 00:12:52,072
Perhaps she was searching for someone.

135
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,818
Who are you searching for, Maheen?

136
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:58,085
Gulrez.

137
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,618
Where is he?

138
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,210
In Ali's room.

139
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,644
He's sitting with Ali and Fajr.

140
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,897
Uncle,

141
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:09,448
Please don't go anywhere.

142
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,049
And ask the Reverend to wait.

143
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,698
The bridegroom's coming.

144
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,698
If I may say so, Gulrez,

145
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:49,918
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl.

146
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,998
She'd clobber him proper!

147
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:58,978
How would one who couldn't forget a slap forget deserting her on the wedding day?

148
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,658
Why this corner meeting?

149
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,031
I'd heard

150
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,694
You're set to become the Chief.

151
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,908
Splendid.

152
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,578
Sitting in the Opposition,

153
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,739
Dreaming of ruling!

154
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:36,079
You can't.

155
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,700
I won't.

156
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,750
Good boy.

157
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,139
So, pray tell,

158
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,324
What were you talking about?

159
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,300
What are you looking at?

160
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,623
I'm your Chief.

161
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,410
Tell me what was going on.

162
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,910
I was saying

163
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,300
That he's picked a fight with the wrong girl.

164
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,812
Yes!

165
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:15,380
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl, Fajr.

166
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,661
I'd clobber him proper!

167
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,311
Relax, Maheen.

168
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:22,501
Why don't you relax, mate?

169
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:23,521
And --

170
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,337
Be done with this corner meeting!

171
00:15:25,337 --> 00:15:27,921
So what, if the enemy's fled?

172
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,502
You'll see when he shows up again,

173
00:15:32,502 --> 00:15:34,945
I'll give him a piece of what he deserves!

174
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,353
I'll leech his blood!

175
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,738
I know.

176
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,428
I haven't forgotten his slap,

177
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,569
How could I forget him deserting me on the wedding day?

178
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,890
Will you help me?

179
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,753
Me?

180
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,790
Are you asking me?

181
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,500
Of course, partner!

182
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,910
Tell me,

183
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:08,533
Will you help me?

184
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:11,394
You don't need to ask!
-Yes.

185
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,053
I will.

186
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:20,467
I haven't let the guests leave.

187
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,777
I've stopped the Reverend too.

188
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,687
I've said, 'Wait',

189
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:30,310
'The bridegroom's coming'.

190
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,777
You got a call from him?

191
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,810
I didn't.

192
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,548
I got an idea.

193
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:44,251
Idea?

194
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:47,787
Have you had dinner?

195
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,127
Come on, Maheen?

196
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,050
As if I'd have anything with all the gloom in the ambience!

197
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,069
Surely, you would in an ambience of merrymaking?

198
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,368
Of course.

199
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,080
Then... Take my hand...

200
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,480
Take me to the Reverend.

201
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,429
Ah, right,

202
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,269
I'd said I'd take you to him.

203
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,630
No, my sweet spoony,

204
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,529
You're not just seating me by the Reverend.

205
00:17:34,951 --> 00:17:37,552
You'll be sitting by my side,

206
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,301
And saying,

207
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,250
'Reverend',

208
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,856
'Commence the nuptials'.

209
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,939
What are you thinking?

210
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:12,691
Don't you love me?

211
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:18,021
Please help me, mate.

212
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,281
Let the blighter be stupefied

213
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,462
When he lands in London

214
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,358
As if

215
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,340
The life has gone out of him!

216
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,689
The life has gone out of him!

Reverend,

234
00:21:17,008 --> 00:21:19,099
Commence the nuptials.

235
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,078
Has the groom arrived?

236
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,409
He sits before you.

237
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,829
Madam,

238
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,159
Do I have your permission?

239
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,389
You may begin, Reverend.

240
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,848
Begin in the Lord's name.

241
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,319
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

242
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:37,400
All praise be to Him, the Lord of the worlds.

243
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,478
And the consequence of the righteous

244
00:22:39,478 --> 00:22:42,525
And peace and blessings be upon the Prophets and Messengers

245
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:46,948
The Prophet Mohammad and his family and companions.

246
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,110
Great.

247
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:59,398
That's what was supposed to happen.

248
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:00,798
What?

249
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,888
What did you say?

250
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:08,438
Do you know, Munshi Alam, that she never wanted to marry me in the first place?

251
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:11,048
She loved Gulrez.

252
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,628
She just wanted to get even with me.

253
00:23:14,628 --> 00:23:17,048
Ammi Begum very aptly said

254
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:19,638
That you deserve half her property

255
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:23,099
And the entirety of her odium.

256
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,128
I'm serving you an ultimatum until tomorrow.

257
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:31,160
Take the papers of the will,

258
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,448
And flit back to where you came from!

259
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,968
Munshi Alam!

260
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,528
Munshi Alam!

261
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,692
Look at this.

262
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,678
Read this.

263
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:06,248
I have proof.

264
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,551
Aye, she's left.

265
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,290
Vivified me

266
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,850
With her touch, and left.

267
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,370
Aye.

268
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,708
Right.

269
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,159
Now I'm just waiting

270
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,628
To get up and start walking.

271
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,818
Come here sometime.

272
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,908
Show your face around here.

273
00:25:02,677 --> 00:25:05,018
Leave that be.

274
00:25:05,818 --> 00:25:08,228
You say it,

275
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:11,378
And I listen quietly.

276
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:17,659
Alright, listen,

277
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:22,198
That blighter's here these days.

278
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:28,749
Got wind of the will being drafted somehow,

279
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:31,669
And showed up the very next day.

280
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,448
No.

281
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:37,808
D'you think I'd let him in?

282
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,698
'Here' as in, he's arrived in Karachi.

283
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,106
Aye,

284
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:50,267
He must be staying in one of those hotels.

285
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,218
He must have.

286
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,638
He must have kids too.

287
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,158
What do you think I am?

288
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:15,499
Even if he showed up with his kids,

289
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,730
I won't let him get past the gates of Kaneez Mahal.

290
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:24,041
I've told the guards

291
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,980
That I don't care if a dog or a cat gets in,

292
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,431
But <i>he</i> must never be allowed inside.

293
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,308
Listen to the next one.

294
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:41,028
He paid a visit to me in my dream last night.

295
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:48,988
He fell at my feet, apologising; I, too, kicked him right in the stomach, saying,

296
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:53,128
'Don't you dare pay me a visit even in my dreams'!

297
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:58,758
I'm talking to Fajr.

298
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,398
I'm leaving tomorrow.

299
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,278
Please, Munshi Alam, just tell me one thing.

300
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,608
She's happy, isn't she?

301
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,198
I mean,

302
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,018
They're both happy, aren't they?

303
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,389
Gulrez, too, sees me as the culprit?

304
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,737
There.

305
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,478
He knew I was doing the right thing.

306
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:04,051
She's very good, too, Munshi Alam, but...

307
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,751
Putting up this façade of a marriage

308
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:10,211
To exact her revenge...

309
00:28:12,103 --> 00:28:14,497
It was simply not cricket.

310
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,993
Trust me, Munshi Alam,

311
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,097
She was doing something very wrong.

312
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,208
Thank goodness I found out about it in time.

313
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,178
I felt like

314
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:36,058
Telling Gulrez everything,

315
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,668
But to be quite honest,

316
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,320
I'd begun suspecting

317
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,863
That Gulrez was in on it with Maheen.

318
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,229
At the very least, I can meet Gulrez, can't I?

319
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,278
First,

320
00:29:11,044 --> 00:29:12,999
Have your tea.

321
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,328
We'll talk later.

322
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:18,278
Munshi Alam, why can't I meet Gulrez?

323
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:21,710
Because Gulrez is dead!

324
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,980
'Gulrez Akhtar, son of Akhtar Mahmoud'
'Akhtar Mahmoud, son of Shahab Ahmed'
'Feriha Akhtar'

325
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,757
'Gulrez Akhtar, son of Akhtar Mahmoud'

326
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,939
Forgive me, mate.

327
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,068
Come on, Waqar,

328
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:34,802
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

329
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,078
That's not what it is.

330
00:31:37,158 --> 00:31:39,208
I'm thoroughly delighted.

331
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:55,440
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

332
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:09,619
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

333
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,807
Thank you.

334
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,808
What happened?

335
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:40,649
I'm seeing you smile after so many years.

336
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,921
How many years?

337
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,868
I felt as if I've never seen you smile widely or laugh.

338
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,308
I'm laughing now.

339
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:54,899
Why?

340
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,468
What happened now?

341
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,228
I think you should go and pick up Daji from school.

342
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:04,309
It's almost 12.

343
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:22,851
♪ <i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance?</i> ♪

344
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,643
Anybody there in the room?

345
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,938
Give me your hand.

346
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,659
I want to touch and feel you.

347
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:59,379
Did we actually get married?

348
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,499
Did you say

349
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,218
'Yes' to my name?

350
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:13,688
Did you say,

351
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,778
'I accept'

352
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:21,533
'Gulrez Akhtar',

353
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,740
'Son of Mahmoud Akhtar'?

354
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,640
'Son of Mahmoud Akhtar'?
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it...</i> ♪

355

♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it...</i> ♪

356
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,499
Aye...

357
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,957
This is the same hand

358
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:50,550
With which you'd write your diary;

359
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,558
With which you'd write your diary;
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

360

♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

361
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:04,999
To me, it felt

362
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,410
As if you're writing my destiny...

363
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,178
I'd think

364
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:20,998
That my life would've been one well-spent

365
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:25,768
Once I held your hand,

366
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,730
And

367
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,012
Sometimes, I'd feel

368
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:38,868
That Death won't dare come near me

369
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:44,748
If I just seized your hand firmly.

370
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,527
If you

371
00:36:58,658 --> 00:37:00,879
Ever chance upon him --

372
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,937
Him --

373
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,709
Waqar Ahmed,

374
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:11,808
Tell him,

375
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,630
That as he departed,

376
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,698
Gulrez said 'Thank you' to him.

377
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,877
Don't let go...

378
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,638
I'd die...

379
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
