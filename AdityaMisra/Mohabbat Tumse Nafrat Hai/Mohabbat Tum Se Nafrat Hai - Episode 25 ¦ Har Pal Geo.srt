1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She even read the letter,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And read it out, too.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a tear fell from her eyes.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't weep, either,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it felt as if

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The light had gone out of her.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing, Nano...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must be mithering!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be coming anytime.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right, I'm fine...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's --

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saying he'll be coming.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he gone?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't be going anywhere!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ask such absurd questions!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's just up to some buffoonery!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano,

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It appears you've been run out!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, she's laughing, Ammi Begum?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's crying, you twit!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just putting up a show of laughter.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this letter?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's sent me a letter.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A love letter!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd read your daughter's love letters now?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is this the time to write love letters?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get the guests something to eat.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be -- A tad late.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what he's written?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I call him?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His phone's switched off...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, Maheen,

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What has happened?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I tell the truth, Nano?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me, too.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's fled, leaving me...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i>

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who break our heart</i>

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We apologise for hurting you with this indecorum;

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The fact is

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A problem's come up.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My groom,

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Mashood Ahmed,

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has left me and fled.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's almost 11 p.m.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll wait for him till 12.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't misconstrue this wait to mean that we're looking for him.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To look for recreant deserters is not a custom we practice.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One who's gone

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is gone.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We just say,

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'May God keep him happy'.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know he's not coming.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, just in case...

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Therefore, we'll wait until 12.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may wait until 12 if you please,

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or have dinner and leave.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm saying all of this

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On behalf of Kaneez Begum.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it is is,

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's a tad woeful,

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So she can't talk.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This apology of mine with folded hands...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it that Kaneez Begum is apologising.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Uncle,

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Munshi Alam to serve the guests dinner in the lawn.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be coming shortly.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen, Maheen!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you say,

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'We won't be looking for him'?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because we won't be looking for him.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me,

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does love need one to look for someone?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, if you do go looking,

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you ever find someone?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You tried looking and lost;

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was right there by you,

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you couldn't get me.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not how it is, partner!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If one deserts in love,

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or loses his way,

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, one who searches for him is a sinner!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Apparently you've turned into a Priest the moment that twit's left!

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pronouncing judgements like that!

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's truly exhilarating, Nano!

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a twist he's given this story!

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're weeping, aren't you?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all, Nano!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd be cursed if I wept.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd actually fallen for the dastard!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May he

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remain happy wherever he is.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about you?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd said the same!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'What about you, Maheen'?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's brilliant, partner.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You do

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exactly what you say!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some juice

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell me

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I should do.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Ammi Begum, sit.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever will happen to you, Kaneez Begum!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened when the clock finally struck 12, Munshi Alam?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, go on.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never let the clock strike 12.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suddenly,

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Climp, clomp',

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Echoed her footfalls as she descended the stairs.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everybody's eyes were on her.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who it was that she was looking at!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps she was searching for someone.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you searching for, Maheen?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is he?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In Ali's room.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's sitting with Ali and Fajr.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle,

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't go anywhere.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And ask the Reverend to sit.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bridegroom's coming.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I may say so, Gulrez,

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd clobber him proper!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How would one who couldn't forget a slap forget deserting her on the wedding day?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why this corner meeting?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd heard

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're set to become the Chief.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sitting in the Opposition,

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dreaming of ruling!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good boy.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, pray tell,

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were you talking about?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your chief.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what was going on.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was saying

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'd picked a fight with the wrong girl.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's picked a fight with the wrong girl, Fajr.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd clobber him proper!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Relax, Maheen.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you relax, mate?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be done with this corner meeting!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what, if the enemy's fled?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see when he shows up again,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll give him a piece of what he deserves!

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll leech his blood!

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't forgotten his slap,

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I forget him deserting me on the wedding day?

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you help me?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you asking me?

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, partner!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me,

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you help me?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to ask!
-Yes.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't let the guests leave.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've stopped the Reverend too.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've said, 'Wait',

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The bridegroom's coming'.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got a call from him?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got an idea.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Idea?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you had dinner?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, Maheen?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'd have anything with all the gloom in the ambience!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, you would in an ambience of merrymaking?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold my hand, then.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me to the Reverend.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, right,

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd said I'd take you to him.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, my sweet spoony,

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not having you sit by the Reverend.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be sitting by my side,

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And saying,

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Reverend',

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Commence the nuptials'.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you thinking about?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you love me?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please help me, mate.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let the blighter be stupefied

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When he lands in London

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The life has gone out of him!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you love me?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even despise you.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let alone the question of love, Monsieur.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ravish you from here.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then,</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then, and then I will forget you</i>

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And then I will forget you</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination,</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i>

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who break our heart</i>

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Reverend,

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Commence the nuptials.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has the groom arrived?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He sits before you.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Madam,

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I have your permission?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may begin, Reverend.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Begin in the Lord's name.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All praise be to Him, the Lord of the worlds.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the consequence of the righteous

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And peace and blessings be upon the Prophets and Messengers

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Prophet Mohammad and his family and companions.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's good.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what was supposed to happen.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What did you say?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know, Munshi Alam, that she never wanted to marry me in the first place?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She loved Gulrez.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just wanted to get even with me.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum very aptly said

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you inherit half her property

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the entirety of her odium.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm serving you an ultimatum until tomorrow.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the papers of the will,

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And flit back to where you came from!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at this.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read this.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have proof.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, she's left.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Vivified me

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With her touch, and left.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now I'm just waiting

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To get up and start walking.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here sometime.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show your face around here.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave that be.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say it,

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I listen quietly.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, listen,

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blighter's around here these days.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got wind of the will being drafted somehow,

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And showed up the very next day.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would I let him get in?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Around here' as in, he's arrived in Karachi.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes,

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must be staying in one of those hotels.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must have.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must have kids too.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think I am?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if he showed up with his kids,

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't let him get past the gates of Kaneez Mahal.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've told the guards

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I don't care if a dog or a cat gets in,

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he must never be allowed in.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen to the next one.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He paid a visit to me in my dream last night.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He fell at my feet, apologising; I, too, kicked him right in the stomach, saying,

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't you dare pay me a visit even in my dreams'!

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking to Fajr.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going tomorrow.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Munshi Alam, just tell me one thing.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's happy, isn't she?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The two of them are happy, aren't they?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez, too, sees me as the culprit?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He knew that I was doing the right thing.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's very good, too, Munshi Alam, but...

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Putting up this façade of a marriage

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To exact her revenge...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was simply not cricket.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trust me, Munshi Alam,

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was doing something very wrong.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank goodness I found out about it in time.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt like

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Telling Gulrez everything,

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But to be quite honest,

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd begun suspecting

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez was in on it with Maheen.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the very least, I can meet Gulrez, can't I?

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First,

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have your tea.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll talk later.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam, why can't I meet Gulrez?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because Gulrez is dead!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, mate.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, Waqar,

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not what it is.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm thoroughly delighted.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm seeing you smile after so many years.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many years?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt as if I've never seen you smile widely or laugh.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm laughing now.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's happened now?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you should go and pick up Daji from the school.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's almost 12.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is anybody there in the room?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me your hand.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to touch and feel you.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did the two of us actually get married?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you say

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Yes' to my name?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you say,

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I accept'

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Gulrez Akhtar',

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Son of Mehmood Akhtar'?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the same hand

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With which you'd write your diary;

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To me, it felt

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you're writing my destiny...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to think

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That my life would've been one well-spent

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once I held your hand,

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, I'd feel

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Death won't dare come near me

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I just seized your hand firmly.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever chance upon him --

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Him --

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed,

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him,

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That as he departed,

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez said 'Thank you' to him.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let go...

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die if you did...

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
