1
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,719
Thank you!

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,950
Here.

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,377
What's with the keys?

4
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:26,755
Aren't you gonna start her?

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,668
She won't...

6
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:34,257
Don't miss your daily ritual though!

7
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,858
She's revving!

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,187
Neelam! She's revving!

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,926
Peace, sir.

10
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,926
Upon you too.

11
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,648
Hey!

12
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,775
Waqar!

13
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,015
Gulrez!

14
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,647
What's this for?

15
00:01:56,713 --> 00:02:00,643
Second time I'm at your place. Second time I'm getting your flowers.

16
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,668
There's also a tie for you. Heard you like 'em.

17
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,259
Don't you?

18
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,940
Sorry, I don't know how to tie one!

19
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,669
Uhh,

20
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,957
Come in?

21
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:15,459
You didn't seriously want to keep me waiting here?
-C'mon.

22
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,000
Waqar!

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,847
Hold it for a sec, will you?

24
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,357
C'mon.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,779
Ever thought why I did any of it?

26
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:44,460
I was dismissed as the Gang Chief four years ago.

27
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,140
And now, four years later, I find she's got your hearts under her claws!

28
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,899
I never thought you'd grow to love her so much!

29
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,074
Did you see Dado?

30
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,595
She doesn't bless you like that.

31
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,337
Ever envy her?

32
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,518
Go on...

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,888
I'm green with envy.

34
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:08,609
I was singularly focused on derailing her Government.

35
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,960
Just think I was waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

36
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,128
And?

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,860
When did you get your moment?

38
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,011
When I found out she asked for some time to think about Gulrez's proposal.

39
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,310
My Spidey-Sense started tingling.

40
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,558
I was like,

41
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:37,568
'You won't get a better opportunity, Waqar Ahmed. Carpe diem'!

42
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:40,338
I felt if I said I wanted to marry her,

43
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:42,988
She'd accept your proposal instantly!

44
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,758
So how does that unseat her?

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,458
Simple!

46
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:52,982
Married folks can be members. But not the Chief!

47
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,489
So that's why she accepted the proposal so quickly!

48
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,928
Of course.

49
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,038
Really?

50
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,859
Did she mention my name?

51
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,440
By the Lord! I heard it myself!

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,300
And after what I did to Dado,

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,538
I'm sure she'd still be writhing with agony!

54
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,081
Stay tuned,

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,509
Because nothing but getting her married off to you pronto will ease her now!

56
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,928
And you?

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,237
Who'd you marry?

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,378
I'll be the Chief for now,

59
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:31,763
And jet off to London the moment I see my term ending.

60
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:35,094
I've got no shortage of English roses dying for me!

61
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,360
We've got too many brown kids here.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,130
Don't want mine to be like <i>them</i>!

63
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,500
Wali! Peace be upon you.

64
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,519
Upon you too. When'd you get here?

65
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,528
I'm on my way out.
-No way, sir.

66
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,924
You're having a cuppa with me.

67
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:58,704
I think I'll pass. But I'll spend some time with you. I can't say no to you.

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,678
Heard you waged war against Ammi Begum?

69
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,899
Oh, World War III, more like!

70
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,319
I swear she would've thrown my things out by now!

71
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:15,009
Who knows, she may even be drafting a disownment declaration.

72
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,040
You haven't had your tea.

73
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,510
No, Wali...

74
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,370
It'll keep me awake...

75
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,697
And I want to sleep peacefully tonight.

76
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,398
I hope you've found a place to sleep.

77
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,958
What was that?

78
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,512
I mean...

79
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,860
Ammi Begum must've thrown his things out by now...

80
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,351
He can't waltz in when he wants now.

81
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,098
It's nothing like that, Wali...

82
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:49,450
I'm Mashood Ahmed's only son...

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,348
I'm sure she'd have some mercy.

84
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,699
Unlike you.

85
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,081
Why? What've I done?

86
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:00,025
I heard you

87
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,528
Called Ammi Begum a 75-year-old cow?

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,059
I hit her where it hurts...

89
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:12,088
Because it's still a few months before she turns 75!

90
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,759
The slap doesn't seem to be working...

91
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,569
Oh, that...

92
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,971
Smite is more like it.

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,551
Beat the laughter out of me.

94
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,121
Can't believe you're still laughing.

95
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,259
I've got no choice.

96
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,601
It was so... Frail...

97
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,302
I can see that.

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,209
A slap hits with five fingers.

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,949
I can see only two on your face.

100
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,450
Oh, Wali...

101
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:42,090
That one

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,930
Ain't Dado's.

103
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,971
Whose is it?

104
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,109
His Maheen.

105
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,592
I'll get going.

106
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,018
I'll drop you outside.

107
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,828
Come.

108
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,330
What happened, Gulrez?

109
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,930
What's with the formalities?

110
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,247
You've brought such good news.

111
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,608
It's the least I could do...

112
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,226
I want to do something for you.

113
00:07:41,406 --> 00:07:42,956
Like?

114
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,227
Teach you how to tie a tie.

115
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,018
I'll get going.

116
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,814
Know why he was here?

117
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,320
To tell that Maheen's ready to marry Gulrez?

118
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,484
No.

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,570
He wanted to tell us

120
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:16,678
That he's ready to give Maheen to Gulrez.

121
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,540
Dastoor Ahmed... Find out where he is...

122
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,849
At Gulrez's.

123
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,749
Just left...

124
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,819
If he just left...

125
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:07,640
I hope he's coming straight back.

126
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:11,390
Call him and let Ammi Begum talk...

127
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,939
Who'd she call?

128
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:17,627
Waqar Ahmed.

129
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:20,856
Ask him where he is yourself.

130
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,941
Ask him yourself.

131
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:27,778
I wouldn't dare, Ammi Begum.

132
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,796
As if I would...

133
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,569
Not after the wretch disgraced me in that one moment...

134
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,327
Hello there, Romeo!

135
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,271
Lunch time.

136
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,348
Come. Double time.

137
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,068
Hey...

138
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,858
Look at me...

139
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,208
You know everything, don't you?

140
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,691
What?

141
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,858
About his benefaction?

142
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,988
No!

143
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,524
He's given you your treasure.

144
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,588
Perhaps he actually doesn't love her!

145
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,028
Don't mind my saying this, Neelam...

146
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,178
But <i>no one</i> puts up such an act in the name of love.

147
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:39,848
Maheen's not off her head.

148
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,482
If she mentioned your name with hers,

149
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:46,031
She's speaking her heart out.

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,930
A girl thinks a hundred times before speaking her heart out.

151
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,910
So, safe to say, if she says Gulrez, she means Gulrez.

152
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,610
She means you.

153
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,888
So please, no more thinking!

154
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,608
Come down, quick. Before your food gets cold!

155
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,357
C'mon!

156
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,887
I'll be waiting!

157
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,868
Sorry, this number is switched off.

158
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,560
This nu --

159
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,360
His phone's off.

160
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,079
Good.

161
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,352
Know how long I've been sleeping?

162
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,511
Eight hours?

163
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,841
And no one roused me.

164
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,632
They fear you. All of them.

165
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,038
Why?

166
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,921
Word on the street is, you don't think before you slap.

167
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,561
Where's Mum?

168
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,218
Sleeping.

169
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:20,169
Why are you playing this game?

170
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:22,652
Because everyone's playing a game here.

171
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,554
What was that, Fajr?

172
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:27,760
You'll find out

173
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,601
I don't say just anything.

174
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,873
I'm quite discerning, you know.

175
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,522
What's for lunch?

176
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,431
Quite a lot.

177
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,951
Go on.

178
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,760
Heart soup,

179
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,721
Heart soup, plot plov,

180
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,823
Heart soup, plot plov, and yes,

181
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,604
Heart soup, plot plov, and yes, barbecued dreams!

182
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,233
What'd you have?

183
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,630
A burger... Nothin' too fancy...

184
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,890
I see a surprising transformation, by the way.

185
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,982
Yeah?

186
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,558
You fight to win.

187
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,731
So?

188
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:09,466
Except

189
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,719
When you fight yourself.

190
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,687
You don't know, silly girl.

191
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,803
I just won that one too.

192
00:14:17,803 --> 00:14:19,930
You don't know, smart girl...

193
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,161
You've been routed.

194
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,251
You've been brought to your knees.

195
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,978
They're gonna fix the date of the engagement soon.

196
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,531
I hear he

197
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,890
Went straight to Gulrez?

198
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,290
Don't even mention <i>him</i>.

199
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,617
Isn't he invited?

200
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,642
Ask him

201
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,112
If he'd come.

202
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,252
Ask me.

203
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,503
I know.

204
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,671
That blighter will be here.

205
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,971
But only

206
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,082
For one last time.

207
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,020
You gonna stand in my way now?

208
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,138
I ain't in your way,

209
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,031
Waqar Ahmed...

210
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,591
I'm laying

211
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,951
The red carpet for you.

212
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,779
No more politics. Please.

213
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,527
Politics...

214
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,358
To the dickens with politics...

215
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,031
Politics peters out and love triumphs.

216
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,369
Big words.

217
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:53,893
Do I see the mightiest abdicating?

218
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,070
Help me up?

219
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,228
Hmm...

220
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,580
I thought the mightiest didn't need anyone's help.

221
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,918
What good is one's might

222
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,360
If one's got to use it on the likes of you?

223
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,988
Take me to your room.

224
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,738
I'll sit with you a while.

225
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,688
Caress your cheek...

226
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,910
I'm sure I've hurt you so bad...

227
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,880
Forget it, Dado...

228
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,046
Those hands ain't that mighty now.

229
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,179
Don't call me Dado.

230
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,671
Say...

231
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:49,171
'75-year-old cow'!

232
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,940
Easy there...

233
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,993
C'mon...

234
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,230
Help me up?

235
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,787
Ahh...

236
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,807
Aye.

237
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,740
Over here...

238
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,915
I'll dye my hair from now on...

239
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,328
Greys ought to reflect experience.

240
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,958
Ahh...

241
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,788
I've been so blind...

242
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:48,207
I could know neither you nor her...

243
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,208
She...

244
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:57,478
Grew up before my eyes and I never knew when she was towering over me...

245
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,908
And...

246
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,359
I never knew when you left m'boy Mashood Ahmed behind...

247
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,497
You upset the board and all the pieces...

248
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,958
You love her so much, don't you?

249
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,992
Who, that brat?

250
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,887
Aye.

251
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,008
That brat.

252
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,879
Dado...

253
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,971
Only a Gulrez could love <i>her</i>.

254
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,958
If Gulrez symbolises the purest of love...

255
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,528
You should start calling yourself that.

256
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:56,253
Don't mind if someone said you're not the full shilling.

257
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,927
No.

258
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,768
I won't mind it one bit.

259
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,358
I know, Waqar Ahmed...

260
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,918
When one's bent on sacrificing everything,

261
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,959
He tries everything to prove

262
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,748
That he's the only one

263
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,269
Whose sacrifice means something.

264
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,729
How do I tell you, Dado -- It was all a game...

265
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,349
A ploy.

266
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:31,689
Out of fury. Or perhaps obstinacy.

267
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:36,676
And -- Saying I want to marry her before everyone... It was all an act...

268
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,638
And what if...

269
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,319
She took it seriously?

270
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,880
Then...

271
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,090
I would've got up her nose for real!

272
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,006
Do you actually hate her so much?

273
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,721
Or is this another one of your many acts for everyone to see?

274
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,117
Gee, Dado...

275
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,376
Alright, laddie...

276
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:13,938
Have it your way...

277
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,689
We'll talk

278
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,489
When the curtain falls...

279
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,884
Need my help?

280
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,807
I ain't in <i>that</i> bad a shape yet!

281
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,330
I can still walk without anyone's help.

282
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,846
Gather yourself.

283
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,397
Looking into your eyes, anyone can see what lies in your heart.

284
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,096
I've never dyed my hair...

285
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,607
I'm allergic to dyes...

286
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:18,500
♪ <i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i> ♪

287
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:27,790
♪ <i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i> ♪

288
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:36,349
♪ <i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i> ♪

289
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:41,270
♪ <i>Who break our heart...</i> ♪

290
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,175
Just one regret, though.

291
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,519
I know...

292
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,379
You shouldn't have said you're marrying Gulrez.

293
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,069
No.

294
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,390
I shouldn't have slapped him.

295
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,822
I'm sure he doesn't regret being slapped.

296
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,480
He ought to.

297
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,613
Hmm... Touché...

298
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:17,317
But I guess being booted out hurts much more.

299
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:19,723
Who booted him out?

300
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:20,818
You.

301
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:23,457
You booted him in the face, more or less.

302
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,990
But he's a good actor.

303
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,398
He didn't let anyone know.

304
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,238
Don't you think he'd go back

305
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,422
To his English roses?

306
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,477
He can go to Hell. Like I care.

307
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:44,145
Who knows, he may even marry Jiya in his fury!

308
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:45,882
So?

309
00:23:46,422 --> 00:23:48,512
Don't you care?

310
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:50,703
I don't give two boots.

311
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,553
Why d'you lie?

312
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,490
That's what happened during the match.

313
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,298
Everything was fine.

314
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:58,600
Until

315
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,206
The bell rang and he didn't come back.

316
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:05,491
Turned out Jiya took him along.

317
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,803
You were waiting for half an hour.

318
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,851
He got late, but he got back.

319
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,241
Your face was too red by then though.

320
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:21,453
You turned the match into a proper mismatch.

321
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,836
What d'you mean?

322
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,951
That's the problem with you.

323
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,368
You ask others the meaning of what's in your heart.

324
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,788
Look at yourself.

325
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,304
You're not angry. You're regretful.

326
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,758
If you were angry, you'd do anything you think of -- Like break random stuff...

327
00:24:41,867 --> 00:24:43,307
But in regret...

328
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:46,177
You don't have a clue what you can do.

329
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:49,799
Your heart wants to apologise to him,

330
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,427
But your ego says

331
00:24:52,427 --> 00:24:55,068
Quiet regret is much better.

332
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,808
And if you ask me,

333
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:00,209
Just an ounce of ego

334
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:02,952
Can ruin this 5'5 girl called Maheen.

335
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,911
Remember...

336
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:08,869
He's suffered two wounds by your hand.

337
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,181
One on his face,

338
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,202
And one on his heart.

339
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,747
The one on his heart

340
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:20,651
Is the one that pains you.

341
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,990
Why'd it pain me?

342
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,227
Who's he to me?

343
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,575
But it's Wednesday, Ammi Begum! Not the weekend.

344
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:51,150
Would you argue with me if I said it's Sunday?

345
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,466
No.

346
00:25:52,747 --> 00:25:54,638
Then, just think

347
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,580
It's Sunday.

348
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:58,138
Fair enough...

349
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,679
Why'd you take off your coat?

350
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:12,540
I ain't going to work today.

351
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:14,739
Why?

352
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,950
Didn't you hear?

353
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,667
It's Sunday.

354
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,163
You called me here?

355
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,747
Aye...

356
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,957
I almost forgot...

357
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:30,067
Why don't you

358
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:33,032
Change and come to the lawn?

359
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,442
Why?

360
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,557
We're playing today.

361
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,341
You too.

362
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,451
I don't know how to play, Ammi Begum.

363
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:51,312
Who said <i>you</i>'re playing?

364
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,058
Our umpire, Munshi Alam, had to go out...

365
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:58,810
Someone's got to fill in...

366
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:02,932
You didn't ask about the teams playing today.

367
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,568
May I?

368
00:27:04,718 --> 00:27:05,988
Pray tell.

369
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:09,557
It's Maheen's Losers vs Waqar's Winners!

370
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,389
Who named the teams?

371
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:18,939
Me and Fajr.

372
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:21,850
Did Maheen make the team? Maheen's Losers?

373
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,097
She's the star!

374
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:25,646
But how?

375
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,936
Like Sunday on Wednesday!

376
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:30,064
Under Dado's reign,

377
00:27:30,064 --> 00:27:31,686
Days will change,

378
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:33,760
Dates will change,

379
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,849
And so will hearts.

380
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:37,380
Hmm!

381
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,248
Aye...

382
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:43,241
That 'hmm' reminds me...

383
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:46,033
Family dinner tonight...

384
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,020
So, after the match...

385
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,157
Don't slip away, okay?

386
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:54,448
Why?

387
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:58,921
We'll fix the date for Maheen and Gulrez's engagement.

388
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,622
Hmm!

389
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,511
That 'hmm' also reminds me...

390
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,529
What are we waiting for?

391
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:09,841
The poor lad's playin' out there all by himself!

392
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,037
Mehrunnisa, I don't know

393
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,340
If what Ammi Begum's doing

394
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,308
Is right,

395
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:47,889
But even if not,

396
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,620
There can be no righter way to do something wrong.

397
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,318
Someone's overstayed her welcome!

398
00:29:24,174 --> 00:29:29,005
Your Dad forbade me from leaving, no matter what you say.

399
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,530
He's been here since yesterday?

400
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,561
Aye.

401
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:41,059
He says he ain't going anywhere until you hear him out.

402
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,097
Give him something to eat

403
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,187
And tell him

404
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,993
I'll hear his story after breakfast.

405
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,820
Get in, Fajr.

406
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,954
I don't think she's coming.

407
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:16,077
She is.

408
00:30:16,077 --> 00:30:17,837
Nano's asked her to.

409
00:30:17,837 --> 00:30:19,893
She won't say no to her.

410
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,991
Actually, that's just an excuse.

411
00:30:21,991 --> 00:30:25,140
She really wants to play cricket this time.

412
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:28,482
I thought she said Nano's place stings at her.

413
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:30,060
And

414
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,533
That she's never playing cricket again?

415
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:35,146
D'you know what it means to play cricket?

416
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,950
Decisions change every moment.

417
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,005
That's what she's been doing all this time.

418
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,877
You better be talking about cricket.

419
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:46,948
No.

420
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:49,277
I'm talking about second thoughts.

421
00:30:49,277 --> 00:30:50,988
Like in cricket.

422
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,030
One ball you hit a six,

423
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,290
And the next one bowls you out.

424
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,640
The situation changes every moment.

425
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,351
You can lose a match you've almost won.

426
00:31:00,351 --> 00:31:01,458
So,

427
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:04,360
Until the last ball's been thrown,

428
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,689
You never think you've won.

429
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:08,205
And...

430
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,842
Look who we have here!

431
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,539
What's she having second thoughts about?

432
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,102
Let's just say... Our star player's out of retirement!

433
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:25,899
Go.

434
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,928
C'mon! Double time!

435
00:31:40,205 --> 00:31:42,436
C'mon, let's go!

436
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,916
Here!

437
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:47,246
Second time I'm on leave.

438
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:51,225
Sometimes, you got to. For the one you love.

439
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,975
So...

440
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,073
Doesn't Wali love you?

441
00:31:57,242 --> 00:31:59,233
We've got married,

442
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,704
That ain't that good an option now.

443
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:04,334
You comin' or arguing about it here?

444
00:32:05,786 --> 00:32:07,134
You know

445
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,875
I'm not a good cricketer.

446
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,957
They all play to win.

447
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:13,505
They all lose when they don't play.

448
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:14,756
Come!

449
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,297
By the way,

450
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:17,958
How do I look?

451
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,789
Like a cricketer!

452
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:23,530
Come on now!

453
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,788
It's going to be fun! You've got to beat everyone!

454
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,858
Tell me any story you want and be done with it.

455
00:32:49,158 --> 00:32:50,981
I've decided

456
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:54,192
To listen to everything you say today.

457
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,328
What do you think?

458
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,348
All this pleading before you

459
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,790
Is

460
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,040
Just to tell you some story?

461
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,098
The truth is

462
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,678
Even now, my heart does not want

463
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,802
To dig up

464
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:24,079
Your mother's grave before you.

465
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,988
Her reckoning is out of my control now.

466
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:32,680
But I can't bear

467
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,747
To stand before my daughter

468
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,748
As the culprit.

469
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,377
Act 1, scene 1... Go on...

470
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,167
What's that?

471
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,468
They're the letters

472
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:09,579
Your mother wrote to her beloved.

473
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,267
You need to read them

474
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,817
Before we go on...

475
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,338
Waqar Ahmed,

476
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:36,690
Fajr Aurangzeb,

477
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,170
Mehrunnisa Dastoor, and Ali Dastoor.

478
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,181
Announcing now the lineup for Maheen's Losers,

479
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:45,951
Who named my team?

480
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,321
It's the jury's decision.

481
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:51,552
You're 'Maheen's Losers' until you win.

482
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,741
We'll see about that. Announce the lineup.

483
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:56,470
Gulrez will be playing for me.

484
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,860
You don't need to ask.

485
00:34:58,962 --> 00:35:01,431
Gulrez will be on your team.

486
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:04,143
Announce the names.

487
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,937
Maheen Aurangzeb,

488
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,867
Gulrez Akhtar,

489
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:12,038
Neelam Wali Ahmed, and...

490
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:15,598
And... Kaneez Maruf Ahmed.

491
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,230
Imagine you're playing against the British Empire.

492
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:29,318
But I'm not as great a cricketer as he's making it sound like.

493
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,938
Toss the coin.

494
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,260
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

495
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,491
May I go from our side?

496
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,824
No.

497
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,840
I got this one.

498
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
