1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
foo

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I look?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like a cricketer!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on now! It's going to be fun! You've got to beat everyone!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me any story you want and be done with it.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To listen to everything you say today.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All this pleading before you

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is just to tell you some story?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The truth is

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart does not want even now

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I dig up

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother's grave before you.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That is out of my control now.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't bear to stand before my daughter

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As the culprit.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Start narrating...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's in it?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those letters

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That your mother wrote to her beloved.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before starting the story,

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need to read these.

25
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,610
Waqar Ahmed,

26
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,730
Fajr Aurangzeb,

27
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:39,575
Mehrunnisa Dastoor, and Ali Dastoor.

28
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:43,075
Announcing now the lineup for Maheen's Losers,

29
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:45,967
Who named my team?

30
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,577
It's the jury's decision.

31
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:51,334
Your team will be 'Maheen's Losers' until you win.

32
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:54,627
We'll see about that. Announce the lineup.

33
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:56,501
Gulrez will be playing for me.

34
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,872
You don't need to ask.

35
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:01,219
Gulrez will be on your team.

36
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:04,249
Announce the names.

37
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:05,679
Maheen Aurangzeb,

38
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,919
Gulrez Akhtar,

39
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:13,380
Neelam Wali Ahmed, and... And...

40
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,591
Kaneez Maruf Ahmed.

41
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:24,534
Imagine you're playing against the British Empire.

42
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:29,884
But the fact is that I'm not as great a cricketer as he's making my name sound like.

43
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:37,074
Toss the coin.

44
00:35:38,864 --> 00:35:41,664
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

45
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,685
May I go from our side?

46
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,124
No.

47
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,768
I will go.

48
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:03,515
