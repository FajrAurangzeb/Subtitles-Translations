1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the keys?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you gonna start her?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't...

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't miss your daily ritual though!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's revving!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam! She's revving!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, sir.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this for?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Second time I'm at your place. Second time I'm getting your flowers.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's also a tie for you. Heard you like 'em.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, I don't know how to tie one!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come in?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't seriously want to keep me waiting here?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold it for a sec, will you?

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought why I did any of it?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was dismissed as the Gang Chief four years ago.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, four years later, I find she's got your hearts under her claws!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought you'd grow to love her so much!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see Dado?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't bless you like that.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever envy her?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on...

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm green with envy.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was singularly focused on derailing her Government.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think I was waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did you get your moment?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I found out she asked for some time to think about Gulrez's proposal.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Spidey-Sense started tingling.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was like,

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You won't get a better opportunity, Waqar Ahmed. Carpe diem'!

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt if I said I wanted to marry her,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd accept your proposal instantly!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So how does that unseat her?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Simple!

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Married folks can be members. But not the Chief!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's why she accepted the proposal so quickly!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did she mention my name?

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord! I heard it myself!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And after what I did to Dado,

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'd still be writhing with agony!

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned,

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because nothing but getting her married off to you pronto will ease her now!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you?

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd you marry?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be the Chief for now,

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And jet off to London the moment I see my term ending.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no shortage of English roses dying for me!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got too many brown kids here.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Don't want mine to be like them!</i>

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali! Peace be upon you.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too. When'd you get here?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on my way out.
-No way, sir.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're having a cuppa with me.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'll pass. But I'll spend some time with you. I can't say no to you.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard you waged war against Ammi Begum?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, World War III, more like!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear she would've thrown my things out by now!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, she may even be drafting a disownment declaration.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't had your tea.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Wali...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll keep me awake...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I want to sleep peacefully tonight.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you've found a place to sleep.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum must've thrown his things out by now...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can't waltz in when he wants now.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that, Wali...

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm Mashood Ahmed's only son...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'd have some mercy.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unlike you.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why? What've I done?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard you

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Called Ammi Begum a 75-year-old cow?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hit her where it hurts...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it's still a few months before she turns 75!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The slap doesn't seem to be working...

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, that...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Smite is more like it.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Beat the laughter out of me.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't believe you're still laughing.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no choice.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was so... Frail...

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see that.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A slap hits with five fingers.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see only two on your face.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Wali...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That one

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't Dado's.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose is it?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Maheen.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll drop you outside.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Gulrez?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the formalities?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've brought such good news.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the least I could do...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to do something for you.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Teach you how to tie a tie.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why he was here?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To tell Maheen's accepted Gulrez's proposal?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wanted to tell us

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's ready to give Maheen to Gulrez.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed... Find out where he is...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Gulrez's.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just left...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he just left...

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope he's coming straight back.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him and let Ammi Begum talk...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd she call?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him where he is yourself.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him yourself.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare, Ammi Begum.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I would...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not after he disgraced me in that one moment...

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello there, Romeo!

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lunch time.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come. Double time.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at me...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know everything, don't you?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About his benefaction?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No!

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's given you your treasure.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps he actually doesn't love her!

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't mind my saying this, Neelam...

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But no one puts up such an act in the name of love.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's not off her head.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Maheen mentioned your name with hers,

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's speaking her heart out.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A girl thinks a hundred times before speaking her heart out.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, safe to say, if she says Gulrez, she means Gulrez.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She means you.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So please, no more thinking!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come down, quick. Before your food gets cold!

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be waiting!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry, this number is switched off.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This nu --

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His phone's off.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know how long I've been sleeping?

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eight hours?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And no one roused me.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They fear you. All of them.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Word on the street is, you don't think before you slap.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Mum?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sleeping.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you playing this game?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because everyone's playing a game here.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that, Fajr?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find out

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't say just anything.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm quite discerning, you know.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's for lunch?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite a lot.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heart soup, plot plov, and yes, barbecued dreams!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you have?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A burger... Nothin' too fancy...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see a surprising transformation, by the way.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You fight to win.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you fight yourself.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know, silly girl.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just won that one too.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know, smart girl...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been routed.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been brought to your knees.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're gonna fix the date of the engagement soon.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear he

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Went straight to Gulrez?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even mention him.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't he invited?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he'd come.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask me. I know.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blighter will be here.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But only

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For one last time.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna stand in my way now?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't in your way,

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm laying

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The red carpet for you.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No more politics. Please.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Politics...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the dickens with politics...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Politics peters out when love triumphs.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big words.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I see the mightiest abdicating?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help me up?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought the mightiest didn't need anyone's help.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What good is one's might

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If one's got to use it on the likes of you?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take me to your room.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll sit with you a while.

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Caress your cheek...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure I've hurt you so bad...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Dado...

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those hands ain't that mighty now.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't call me Dado.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'75-year-old cow'!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy there...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help me up?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll dye my hair from now on...

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Greys ought to reflect experience.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been so blind...

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could know neither you nor her...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grew up before my eyes and I never knew when she was towering over me...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never knew when you left m'boy Mashood Ahmed behind...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You upset the board and all the pieces...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You love her so much, don't you?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who, that brat?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That brat.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Only a Gulrez could love her.</i>

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If Gulrez symbolises the purest of love...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should start calling yourself that.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't mind if someone said you're not the full shilling.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't mind it one bit.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know, Waqar Ahmed...

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When one's bent on sacrificing everything,

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He tries everything to prove

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's the only one

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose sacrifice means something.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I tell you, Dado -- It was all a game...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A ploy.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of fury. Or perhaps obstinacy.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- Saying I want to marry her before everyone... It was all an act...

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what if...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She took it seriously?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've got up her nose for real!

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you actually hate her so much?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or is this another one of your many acts for everyone to see?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gee, Dado...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, laddie...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll talk

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the curtain falls...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Need my help?

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't in that bad a shape yet!

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can still walk without anyone's help.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gather yourself.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking into your eyes, anyone can see what lies in your heart.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never dyed my hair...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm allergic to dyes...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones</i>

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who break our heart...</i>

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one regret, though.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have said you're marrying Gulrez.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I shouldn't have slapped him.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he doesn't regret being slapped.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ought to.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm... Touché...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I guess being booted out hurts much more.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who booted him out?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You booted him in the face, more or less.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he's a good actor.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't let anyone know.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think he'd go back

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To his English roses?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May he go to Hell. Like I care.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, he may even get married to Jiya in his fury!

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you care?

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't give two boots.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you lie?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what happened during the match.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything was fine.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bell rang and he didn't come back.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When we found out Jiya took him along?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were waiting for half an hour.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got late, but he got back.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your face was too red by then though.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You turned the match into a proper mismatch.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's the problem with you.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ask others the meaning of what's in your heart.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at yourself.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not angry. You're regretful.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you were angry, you'd do anything you think of -- Like break random stuff...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But in regret...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have a clue what you can do.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your heart wants to apologise to him,

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But your ego says

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Regret is much better.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if you ask me,

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just an ounce of ego

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can ruin this 5'5 girl called Maheen.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember...

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's suffered two wounds by your hand.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One on his face,

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And one on his heart.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one on his heart

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the one that pains you.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd it pain me?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's he to me?

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's Wednesday, Ammi Begum! Not the weekend.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you argue with me if I said it's Sunday?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then, just think

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Sunday.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you take off your coat?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't going to work today.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you hear?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Sunday.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me here?

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost forgot...

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Change and come to the lawn?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're playing today.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You too.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how to play, Ammi Begum.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who said you're playing?</i>

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our umpire, Munshi Alam, had to go out...

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's got to fill in...

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't ask about the teams playing today.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I?

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pray tell.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Maheen's Losers vs Waqar's Winners!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who named the teams?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me and Fajr.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Maheen make the team? Maheen's Losers?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like Sunday on Wednesday!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Under Dado's reign,

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Days will change,

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dates will change,

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And so will hearts.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That 'hmm' reminds me...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Family dinner tonight...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, after the match...

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't slip away, okay?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll fix the date for Maheen and Gulrez's engagement.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That 'hmm' also reminds me...

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are we waiting for?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor lad's playin' out there all by himself!

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa, I don't know

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If what Ammi Begum's doing

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is right,

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But even if not,

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There can be no righter way to do something wrong.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's overstayed her welcome!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Dad forbade me from leaving, no matter what you say.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been here since yesterday.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says he ain't going anywhere until you do as he says.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give him something to eat

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell him

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hear his story after breakfast.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get in, Fajr.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think she's coming.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She is.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's asked her to.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't say no to her.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually, that's just an excuse.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She really wants to play cricket this time.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought she said Nano's place stings at her.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she's never playing cricket again?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know what it means to play cricket?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Decisions change every moment.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what she's been doing all this time.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better be talking about cricket.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about second thoughts.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like in cricket.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One ball you hit a six,

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the next one bowls you out.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The situation changes every moment.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can lose a match you've almost won.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So,

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until the last ball's been thrown,

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You never think you've won.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look who we have here!

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's she having second thoughts about?

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say... Our star player's out of retirement!

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon! Double time!

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, let's go!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Second time I'm on leave.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, you got to. For the one you love.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Doesn't Wali love you?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've got married,

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ain't that good an option now.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You comin' or arguing about it here?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not a good cricketer.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They all play to win.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They all lose when they don't play.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way,

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do I look?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like a cricketer!

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on now!

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's going to be fun! You've got to beat everyone!

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me any story you want and be done with it.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To listen to everything you say today.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you think?

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All this pleading before you

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just to tell you some story?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The truth is

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even now, my heart does not want

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To dig up

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother's grave before you.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her reckoning is out of my control now.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I can't bear

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To stand before my daughter

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As the culprit.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Act 1, scene 1... Go on...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's that?

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're the letters

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother wrote to her beloved.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need to read them

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before I begin.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed,

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr Aurangzeb,

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa Dastoor, and Ali Dastoor.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Announcing now the lineup for Maheen's Losers,

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who named my team?

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the jury's decision.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're 'Maheen's Losers' until you win.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see about that. Announce the lineup.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez will be playing for me.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to ask.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez will be on your team.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Announce the names.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb,

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez Akhtar,

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam Wali Ahmed, and... And...

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kaneez Maruf Ahmed.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine you're playing against the British Empire.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm not as great a cricketer as he's making it sound like.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Toss the coin.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I go from our side?

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got this one.

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
