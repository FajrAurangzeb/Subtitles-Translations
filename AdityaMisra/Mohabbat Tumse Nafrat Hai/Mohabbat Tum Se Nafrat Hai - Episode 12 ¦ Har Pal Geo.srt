1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,361
I mean it, Nano.

2
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,711
I saw her with my own eyes.

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:18,735
Maheen was behind the white-bearded man.

4
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,358
For a moment, I felt

5
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,504
Like my world had been upended.

6
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:29,235
Until... She approached me.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,488
Maheen?

8
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,628
Of course.

9
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:37,428
Maheen.

10
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:40,938
She said,

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,410
'The painter remembers his painting, Gulrez',

12
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:48,222
'But not the other way around'.

13
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,751
'The painting but looks for an art gallery'

14
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,823
'That would adorn its ornamented wall with her beauty'.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,011
So

16
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,561
You

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,559
Are here to tell me

18
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,800
That you

19
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,998
Aren't gonna marry Maheen?

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,689
Don't mistake me for one of your English roses,

21
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:31,862
Who'd fall for the hollow words of a London tramp!

22
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,638
If I talk nicely to you,

23
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,818
Just know it's my love for Uncle Mashood!

24
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,444
As for you, I loathe you so much

25
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:44,019
I'd spit in your face any day!

26
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,231
But <i>you</i>!

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,588
You dare say you want to marry Maheen Aurangzeb?

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,150
D'you think Your Highness is at a departmental store?

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,921
D'you think you can pull out your riches and buy everything under the sun?

30
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,848
Have some shame!

31
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,940
You're friends with God-knows-how-many girls!

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,428
And now, you've got your eyes on <i>me</i>!

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,638
Your Royal Highness would do well to remember

34
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:27,908
I won't think twice before chopping those filthy hands off!

35
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:30,448
Stop it, Maheen!

36
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:32,139
Don't stop me, Aunt.

37
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,669
It's best for him

38
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,695
If he packed his bags and jetted off to London before this instant!

39
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,619
You can't stay here!

40
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,510
So get going!

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,428
And aye,

42
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:51,414
If you dared say so much as my name,

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,240
I'd ruin you!

44

Dado's right...

57
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,291
It isn't proper to marry

58
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,689

He got hurt?

67
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,061
How?

68
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,871
She threw

69
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,921
Whatever she could get her hands on.

70
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,011
He's a proper man too.

71
00:06:08,011 --> 00:06:10,791
He didn't move an inch.

72
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,058
What'd he think?

73
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:19,691
That's what you wanted, innit?

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,528
Go...

75
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:30,948
Check on him...

76
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,622
Gulrez...

77
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:39,679
Not every dream mirrors your fate.

78
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:42,988
Sometimes, your fate

79
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:45,670
Is the opposite of your dreams.

80
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,720
So...

81
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,361
Would you care more about the dream... Or your fate?

82
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,245
Hello?

83
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,509
It's Suraiyya, Mehrunnisa.

84
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,940
Aye?

85
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,866
Was Maheen there?

86
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,410
No.

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,246
A storm is more like it.

88
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,828
What happened?

89
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,949
She thundered down on Waqar Ahmed.

90
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:46,100
Threw whatever she could see at him!

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,129
What?

92
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,770
Don't even ask about it.

93
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,328
She left him a wreck.

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,809
I saw his lip bleed.

95
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,429
Good Lord...

96
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,241
Why didn't you stop her?

97
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,490
We could.

98
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,809
Except she wouldn't.

99
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,387
Honestly?

100
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,493
She's been <i>very</i> cruel.

101
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:09,488
He'd done nothing to earn Maheen's punishment.

102
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,360
Why don't you ask Ammi Begum?

103
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,611
I feel like asking her for real this time.

104
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,988
If he wants to marry Maheen,

105
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:23,249
I don't see how it's wrong to think about it or express his wish.

106
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,669
What can I do, Mehrunnisa?

107
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,699
I'm very worried myself.

108
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,039
I thought

109
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,009
There'd be a minor row before everything's over.

110
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,047
But Maheen!

111
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,259
Mind if I said something?

112
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,329
I'm sorry but...

113
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,008
You're just as guilty.

114
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,918
Mind if I said something, too, Mehrunnisa?

115
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:49,979
Granted

116
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:52,339
It was most unfortunate,

117
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,210
I know just as well as everyone else

118
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,069
That there's no one like Waqar Ahmed in the family.

119
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,338
But when it's about promises...

120
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:05,143
Your honour depends on keeping it.

121
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,215
Ammi Begum ain't gonna take the world's million insults

122
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,060
For this one silly love story.

123
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,132
I'd never want

124
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,458
To sacrifice Gulrez Akhtar

125
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:20,913
For the sake of one Waqar Ahmed's wish.

126
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,957
Who told you to do any of this?

127
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,778
We talked about breaking his face.

128
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,478
So you'd actually do it?

129
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:41,608
I do

130
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,259
What I say!

131
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,890
What'd he think?

132
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,950
Oh!

133
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,501
You're worried about what <i>he</i> thinks!

134
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,631
I told him

135
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,740
To pack his bags and get going!

136
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:52,861
From?

137
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,621
Nano's place, of course!

138
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:56,726
You calling the shots there now?

139
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,001
Well, then, lemme be clear...

140
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:01,721
I ain't setting foot there

141
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,971
As long as that man's around!

142
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:06,732
You broke his face or all ties with him?

143
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,641
Who's he to me?

144
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,625
Whoa.

145
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,026
So now, you're not on talking terms.

146
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,846
No going over in life and death...

147
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,507
You ended everything, didn't you?

148
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,597
I haven't got time for hollow ties.

149
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,127
So you'd rather gibbet a man

150
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:22,757
For desiring to marry you?

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,580
I don't know about anyone else, but <i>he</i> deserves every bit of it!

152
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,678
Very cruel.

153
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,248
If he dared say another word,

154
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,489
You're all gonna see this ain't even close to the worst of me!

155
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,177
And what are <i>you</i> doing here?

156
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,423
Learning the art of disguise!

157
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,880
Who's in disguise?

158
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,428
Who isn't?

159
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:53,661
I'm amusing myself with the spectacle.

160
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:57,649
I mean, Jesus Christ, each actor is better than the next!

161
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,179
Blimey, Neelam...

162
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,650
I didn't know what an earthquake was until I saw her.

163
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,873
She upturned everything before you could blink!

164
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,001
I swear,

165
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:20,911
If she had a gun,

166
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,402
She would've shot Waqar Ahmed dead!

167
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:25,342
That's rude.

168
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,912
Waqar's family. Her Uncle's son.

169
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:30,391
It's okay between cousins!

170
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,966
He didn't go to <i>her</i> with the proposal.

171
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,568
He just talked to Ammi Begum.

172
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,558
The least he had was that right.

173
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,998
What next?

174
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:50,938
Everyone's gonna curse her. Pull her up.

175
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:55,817
Although, to be quite frank, it is a bit unbelievable. She's very decent.

176
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,108
She does have a thing for pranks, but... Nothing like <i>this</i>...

177
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:02,399
As if I'm lying!

178
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,638
I'm just a bit surprised

179
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,181
That she wreaked this havoc and Waqar stood there quietly...

180
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,228
By the Lord,

181
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,651
He didn't move an inch.

182
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,398
She'd have to apologise for that.

183
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,978
She ain't all <i>that</i> decent!

184
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:30,678
You can have it in writing, Gulrez Akhtar,

185
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,088
She'd beg forgiveness.

186
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,768
What are you looking at?

187
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:40,654
Just thinking.

188
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,663
About?

189
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,548
Thinking about what kind of man

190
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:49,482
Would stand firm in his place as an earthquake wreaks havoc all around

191
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,388
Without moving an inch...

192
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,398
Go see where he's going!

193
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,988
If one look could tell...

194
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,578
Go after him!

195
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,182
He took his car and left.

196
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,699
He left?

197
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,961
Who?

198
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:57,929
Waqar.

199
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:01,060
Big deal.

200
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm very worried, Ammi Begum.

201
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,258
Don't worry.

202
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:07,988
He can drive.

203
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:12,049
You haven't seen the fury on his face, Mum!

204
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,348
It's only fair!

205
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,718
That puny pixie

206
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:20,948
Almost swallowed him whole!

207
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:23,864
What if he went straight to her?

208
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,070
The phone...

209
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,632
Quickly! Here!

210
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,678
Call her...

211
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,048
Hello?

212
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,274
It's Ammi Begum.

213
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:55,889
Yes, Ammi Begum?

214
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,320
Bolt the doors and shut the windows!

215
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,478
He's coming!

216
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:00,508
Who?

217
00:15:00,554 --> 00:15:03,935
The man with the broken face!

218
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,998
Okay!

219
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,371
Hi, Aunt!

220
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,930
How are you, Jiya?

221
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,128
Dreadful.

222
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:29,040
She's such a cheat I feel like I'd kill her!

223
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,489
Kill her!

224
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:31,713
Where's she?

225
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,313
Upstairs. Be careful.

226
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:34,963
She's in a temper.

227
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:36,353
Why?

228
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,259
Something... Happened.

229
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:41,700
Nothing much. Waqar, you know...

230
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,851
He proposed to her.

231
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,093
And?

232
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:49,859
She disposed of him.

233
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,881
Umm...

234
00:15:54,881 --> 00:15:56,771
I'll go see her.

235
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,831
Why'd you have to tell her?

236
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:04,012
I know who to tell what and when!

237
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,268
Bolt the door. He's coming.

238
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,891
Who?
-Waqar.

239
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:09,470
Won't you let him in?

240
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,318
I hear he left in a fury.

241
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:13,149
Don't bolt the door.

242
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,840
Ask Khushi Mohammad to put anything that can break away!

243
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,237
Khushi Mohammad!

244
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:21,468
Khushi Mohammad!

245
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,325
Too late...

246
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,047
Waqar...

247
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,603
Forgive her, m'boy.

248
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,117
I'm here to say sorry.

249
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,520
I hurt her for no reason.

250
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,008
She's hurt you real bad...

251
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,408
It's nothing.

252
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,548
She just got even for the old slap.

253
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,208
So...

254
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,298
Where's she?

255
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,188
Upstairs. In her room.

256
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:05,068
Don't do anything...

257
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:06,909
It's okay, Aunt.

258
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:08,849
Back off.

259
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,119
Back. Off!

260
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,328
I

261
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:12,728
I said

262
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:13,118
I said BACK

263
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:15,129
I said BACK OFF!

264
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,955
Don't you dare come upstairs.

265
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,271
Please, Mum...

266
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:22,460
Tell him

267
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,900
He's not welcome when I'm around!

268
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,111
And <i>you</i>! You better hear this...

269
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,602
Your theatrics won't work here!

270
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,432
Go back where you came from!

271
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:33,130
What are you doing, Maheen?

272
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,048
Nothing this blighter doesn't deserve!

273
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:37,810
And aye,

274
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,218
I've decided for real this time...

275
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,288
Won't you ask me

276
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:49,630
What it's about?

277
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,958
I thought you were so excited about it.

278
00:17:52,048 --> 00:17:54,148
What d'you mean?

279
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:57,689
I've decided

280
00:17:58,169 --> 00:17:59,459
To marry

281
00:17:59,459 --> 00:18:01,599
Gulrez.

282
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,568
I did the right thing, didn't I?

283
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,966
You gave him the boot.

284
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,005
I didn't really want to.

285
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,499
Don't be apologetic, mate.

286
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,722
Those who break hearts

287
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,298
Ought to live with heartbreak.

288
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,909
Whose heart did he break?

289
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:07,287
Those who make friends are connatural heartbreakers.

290
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,020
They make careless promises,

291
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,686
Swear hollow vows...

292
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,980
But when they come to,

293
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:20,141
They go back on them both.

294
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,981
Just pray he leaves.

295
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,836
Why are you so afraid of his being here?

296
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,334
I don't think I can face him.

297
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,128
Is that regret I hear?

298
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,780
It's nothing like that.

299
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:36,926
He's guilty...

300
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,176
But I don't know

301
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:42,836
What he's guilty of.

302
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,944
Isn't it enough he said, 'I'm gonna marry Maheen' before everyone?

303
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,854
Aye, but it isn't exactly wrong, is it, Jiya?

304
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,327
It's okay between cousins...

305
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,216
Sometimes, you begin to like someone...

306
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:00,900
I mean, he didn't tell me.

307
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,427
He told Nano.

308
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,908
Nano's order would've been enough to stop him.

309
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,211
With so many people to refuse...

310
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,597
Me giving him the boot...

311
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:14,577
Doesn't seem fair...

312
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,624
But you did... And for real...

313
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:21,467
He slapped me...

314
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,628
But I gave him the boot...

315
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:27,899
Everyone's gonna doubt you if you regret what you did!

316
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,539
Doubt me?

317
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,820
We can all doubt you're not all right upstairs.

318
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,821
Mind if I turned in?

319
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,015
No.

320
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,872
I'll call you at night.

321
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,272
And aye...

322
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,124
If you can't sleep,

323
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:48,760
Write your diary.

324
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,656
Pour your heart out.

325
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,727
It'll give you some peace.

326
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,320
She went to bed.

327
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,266
Take care of her, Aunt.

328
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:26,851
Take care, love.

329
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,427
Bye.
-Bye.

330
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,606
Let's go, shall we?

331
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:55,918
Where?

332
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,897
Over to Neelam's.

333
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,127
Why?

334
00:22:59,193 --> 00:23:01,843
Tell her she's agreed.

335
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:03,464
Ask her again

336
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:04,903
If she means it.

337
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:06,810
She announced it out loud.

338
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,903
No room for questions now.

339
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:11,633
She named Gulrez too.

340
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,090
You wanted her to nod quietly.

341
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,099
But - God bless her - she said his name out loud!

342
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:22,479
But I wonder what this delay's about.

343
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:24,950
You call them every other moment.

344
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,640
Here's an idea. I'll call her.

345
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,730
Nano would be delighted!

346
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,108
Wait, Fajr.

347
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,461
Let her wake up.

348
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,841
I'll ask her.

349
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:36,422
She'd change her decision when she gets up.

350
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:39,081
Don't waste this chance.

351
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:41,062
Now that she's said it,

352
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:44,022
Just break the news to everyone!

353
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:44,980
Actually...

354
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,361
No need...

355
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:48,280
Just tell Ammi Begum.

356
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,460
She'll take care of the rest.

357
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,095
You're overstepping your limits, Fajr!

358
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,278
Hey!

359
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:56,358
My sister's agreed to marry him.

360
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:58,668
So many people got their wish.

361
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:01,018
We can finally fulfil our promises.

362
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:02,842
Our honour's intact.

363
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,833
Can't I be just a bit delighted?

364
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,397
Ohhhh...

365
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,297
I get it...

366
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:13,517
What?

367
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:14,880
I get it.

368
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,140
As always, you want to tell Nano yourself.

369
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,570
Lemme call her.

370
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,271
Just a sec.

371
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,591
What happened?

372
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,628
I hope you didn't say anything!

373
00:25:00,718 --> 00:25:03,058
She's just a silly girl.

374
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,830
She's got a mind of her own.

375
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:08,602
Takes two and two together to get twenty.

376
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:11,012
Hope you didn't slap her or something.

377
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,400
She's ready.

378
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,200
Ready?

379
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,620
She said yes?

380
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,938
Aye.

381
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,057
At the slight inconvenience of getting a few broken teeth, it's done.

382
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,479
She still said yes?

383
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,341
You all plot here, don't you?

384
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:37,994
Especially <i>you</i>, Dado...

385
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,772
Life's a bleedin' chessboard to you, isn't it?

386
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,610
Pawn to F7,

387
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,792
Queen takes Rook...

388
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,047
Checkmate.

389
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,490
You just don't want to be on the wrong end of it.

390
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,660
But there's greater grandmasters than you 'round here.

391
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,850
Such as this London tramp.

392
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,868
A loafer, aye. A wastrel, too, aye. But one...

393
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:10,820
Who's mastered the art of the checkmate with his English roses...

394
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,378
What'd she say?

395
00:26:13,443 --> 00:26:17,444
I'm sure you'd get the news... But tell me...

396
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,790
How d'you intend to tan your hide?

397
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,861
Before I do that,

398
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,917
I'm gonna skin her alive! Claw her eyes out and cut that tongue of hers!

399
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,212
Why?

400
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,668
Why'd you claw her eyes out and cut her tongue

401
00:26:41,728 --> 00:26:44,156
For speaking her heart out?

402
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:47,775
You seem to have got old blood with love.

403
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,216
I expected no better from you.

404
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,578
I knew the spark that rages within you would burn us all down.

405
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,429
Grab a pew, Dastoor Ahmed...

406
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,147
Enjoy

407
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,975
The heat...

408
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,047
You know Uncle Dastoor enjoying the heat ain't gonna cool you down, Dado!

409
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:24,892
KNOW YOUR LIMITS!

410
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,970
Hear those who limit the desires of hearts

411
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,959
Cry out, 'Know your limits'!

412
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,142
The times have changed, Dado.

413
00:27:43,308 --> 00:27:47,705
No longer will the Nanos and Dados chain hearts...

414
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,477
Love brings them all to their knees.

415
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,608
Well...

416
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:02,978
You don't know me, Waqar Ahmed...

417
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:05,961
I know <i>you</i> inside out, Dado.

418
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:10,079
You play politics in love.

419
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:15,528
What are you saying?
-Just a second, Uncle Dastoor...

420
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,630
I ain't even started yet.

421
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,150
Consumed in the intoxication of power,

422
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,302
This so-called lady of 65...

423
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:34,062
This 75-year-old <i>cow</i>, I say...

424
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,503
Thinks the palaces of love are but sandcastles!

425
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,607
I dare her to take up arms.

426
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,290
She'll be dust in no time.

427
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,314
She'll be dust in no time. Poof!

428
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,648
Aye...

429
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,356
The phone...

430
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,857
Do it nice and proper.

431
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,830
Clean it everyday. I don't want this getting dirty.

432
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,397
And the dust over there! Goodness!

433
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,968
Hello?

434
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,237
Give your Mum the phone.

435
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,398
Mum!

436
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,270
What is it?

437
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,758
Nano...

438
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,528
Aye, Ammi Begum?

439
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:08,698
Maheen said yes?

440
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,936
Aye.

441
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,924
Where were you?

442
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,037
Right by her.

443
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:16,969
And Waqar?

444
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,660
With us.

445
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,089
And you looked on quietly?

446
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:26,515
What could I do?

447
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,422
Slap properly!

448
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,981
Slap who?

449
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,932
The twit who broke everything here to punish that blighter!

450
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,197
Know what,

451
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:42,644
I wouldn't tire of kissing his face,

452
00:31:42,689 --> 00:31:46,163
Yet even he barked like mad at me today!

453
00:31:46,223 --> 00:31:47,460
He said,

454
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:49,950
'Consumed in the intoxication of power',

455
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,647
'This 75-year-old cow'

456
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:57,479
'Thinks the palaces of love are but sandcastles'!

457
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,234
'I dare her to take up arms'!

458
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,921
'She'll be dust in no time'.

459
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,782
'She'll be dust in no time. Poof'!

460
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:07,002
Why'd he say that?

461
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,440
Because your sweet little girl said yes!

462
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,589
Where's he?

463
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,508
He left when I slapped him.

464
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:17,298
Good Heavens...

465
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,388
You pitying him?

466
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,205
You would too.

467
00:32:23,648 --> 00:32:27,165
He's been humiliated here too.

468
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:30,417
Maheen said before him...

469
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,360
That she's ready to marry Gulrez.

470
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,918
There's just one way out.

471
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,033
Kill me one of these days.

472
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,958
Which father in the world

473
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,490
Can leave

474
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,540
His daughter alone in the wild world

475
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,780
And live in peace?

476
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,190
You've got to decide...

477
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,380
Would you rather kill me,

478
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,361
Or listen

479
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:30,281
To my side of the story someday.

480
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,591
I'm leaving this job, Mademoiselle.

481
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,217
I can't make a girl's father wait outside her door like that.

482
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,097
Don't leave her.

483
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,538
She's

484
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,973
Changed, of late...

485
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,849
She left herself

486
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,368
Without asking me to leave.

487
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,576
If you're done cleaning your Foxy, come inside?

488
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:51,409
Your cuppa's ready.

489
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,710
Could I have it here?

490
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,983
I'll thank you.
