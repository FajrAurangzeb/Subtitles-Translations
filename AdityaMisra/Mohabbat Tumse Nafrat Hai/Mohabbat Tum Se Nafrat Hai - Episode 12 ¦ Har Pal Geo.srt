1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it, Nano.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw her with my own eyes.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen was behind the white-bearded man.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For a moment, I felt

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like my world had been upended.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until... She approached me.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said,

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The painter remembers his painting, Gulrez',

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'But not the other way around'.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The painting but looks for an art gallery'

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'That would adorn its ornamented wall with her beauty'.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are here to tell me

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't gonna marry Maheen?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't mistake me for one of your English roses,

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd fall for the hollow words of a London tramp!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I talk nicely to you,

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just know it's my love for Uncle Mashood!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As for you, I loathe you so much

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd spit in your face any day!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you!</i>

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You dare say you want to marry Maheen Aurangzeb?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think Your Highness is at a departmental store?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think you can pull out your riches and buy everything under the sun?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're friends with God-knows-how-many girls!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, you've got your eyes on me!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Royal Highness would do well to remember

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't think twice before chopping those filthy hands off!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Maheen!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't stop me, Aunt.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's best for him

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he packed his bags and jetted off to London before this instant!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't stay here!

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So get going!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye,

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you dared say so much as my name,

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd ruin you!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't mistake me for one of your English roses,

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd fall for the hollow words of a London tramp!

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're friends with God-knows-how-many girls!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now, you've got your eyes on me!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Royal Highness would do well to remember...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you dared say so much as my name,

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd ruin you!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you see what a force to reckon with girls can be, Waqar Ahmed...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado's right...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't proper to marry

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A friend.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me...</i>

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And feast on my heart...</i>

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got hurt?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She threw

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever she could get her hands on.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a proper man too.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't move an inch.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he think?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what you wanted, innit?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go...

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check on him...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not every dream mirrors your fate.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, your fate

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the opposite of your dreams.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you care more about the dream... Or your fate?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Suraiyya, Mehrunnisa.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was Maheen there?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A storm is more like it.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She thundered down on Waqar Ahmed.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Threw whatever she could see at him!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even ask about it.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She left him a wreck.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw his lip bleed.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you stop her?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We could.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Except she wouldn't.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She's been very cruel.</i>

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd done nothing to earn Maheen's punishment.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you ask Ammi Begum?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel like asking her for real this time.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he wants to marry Maheen,

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't see how it's wrong to think about it or express his wish.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can I do, Mehrunnisa?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very worried myself.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There'd be a minor row before everything's over.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Maheen!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I said something?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry but...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just as guilty.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I said something, too, Mehrunnisa?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Granted

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was most unfortunate,

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know just as well as everyone else

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That there's no one like Waqar Ahmed in the family.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when it's about promises...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your honour depends on keeping it.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum ain't gonna take the world's million insults

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For this one silly love story.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never want

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To sacrifice Gulrez Akhtar

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the sake of one Waqar Ahmed's wish.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you to do any of this?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We talked about breaking his face.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you'd actually do it?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What I say!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd he think?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You're worried what he thinks!</i>

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told him

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To pack his bags and get going!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's place, of course!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You calling the shots there now?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, lemme be clear...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't setting foot there

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as that man's around!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You broke his face or all ties with him?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's he to me?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So now, you're not on talking terms.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No going over in life and death...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ended everything, didn't you?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't got time for hollow ties.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you'd rather gibbet a man

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For desiring to marry you?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I don't know about anyone else, but he deserves every bit of it!</i>

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very cruel.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he dared say another word,

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're all gonna see this ain't even close to the worst of me!

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And what are you doing here?</i>

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Learning the art of disguise!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's in disguise?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who isn't?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm amusing myself with the spectacle.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, Jesus Christ, each actor is better than the next!

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Neelam...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't know what an earthquake was until I saw her.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She upturned everything before you could blink!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear,

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she had a gun,

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She would've shot Waqar Ahmed dead!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's rude.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar's family. Her Uncle's son.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay between cousins!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't go to her with the proposal.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just talked to Ammi Begum.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The least he had was that right.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What next?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's gonna curse her. Pull her up.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although, to be quite frank, it is a bit unbelievable. She's very decent.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does have a thing for pranks, but... Nothing like this...

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I'm lying!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just a bit surprised

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she wreak this havoc and Waqar stood there quietly...

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord,

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't move an inch.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd have to apologise for that.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>She ain't all that decent!</i>

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can have it in writing, Gulrez Akhtar,

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd beg forgiveness.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just thinking.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thinking about what kind of man

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would stand firm in his place as an earthquake wreaks havoc all around

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without moving an inch...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go see where he's going!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If one look could tell...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go after him!

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took his car and left.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very worried, Ammi Begum.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He can drive.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't seen the fury on his face, Mum!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's only fair!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That puny pixie

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost swallowed him whole!

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if he went straight to her?

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The phone...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly! Here!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Ammi Begum.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Ammi Begum?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bolt the doors and shut the windows!

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's coming!

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The man with the broken face!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay!

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Aunt!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you, Jiya?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dreadful.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's such a cheat I feel like I'd kill her!

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kill her!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's she?

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upstairs. Be careful.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's in a temper.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something... Happened.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much. Waqar, you know...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He proposed to her.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She disposed of him.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Umm...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll go see her.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you have to tell her?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know who to tell what and when!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bolt the door. He's coming.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?
-Waqar.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you let him in?

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear he left in a fury.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't bolt the door.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Khushi Mohammad to put anything that can break away!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Khushi Mohammad!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Khushi Mohammad!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not good...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar...

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive her, m'boy.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here to say sorry.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hurt her for no reason.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's hurt you real bad...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just got even for the old slap.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's she?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upstairs. In her room.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't do anything...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay, Aunt.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back off.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back. Off!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said BACK

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said BACK OFF!

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare come upstairs.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Mum...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not welcome when I'm around!

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you better hear this...

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your theatrics won't work here!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go back where you came from!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing, Maheen?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing this blighter doesn't deserve!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye,

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided for real this time...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you ask me

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What it's about?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you were so excited about it.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To marry

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did the right thing, didn't I?

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gave him the boot.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't really want to.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be apologetic, mate.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who break hearts

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ought to live with heartbreak.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose heart did he break?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who make friends are connatural heartbreakers.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They make careless promises,

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Swear hollow vows...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when they come to,

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They go back on them.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray he leaves.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you so afraid of his being here?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think I can face him.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is that regret I hear?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's guilty...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't know

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What he's guilty of.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't it enough he said, 'I'm gonna marry Maheen' before everyone?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but it isn't exactly wrong, is it, Jiya?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay between cousins...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, you begin to like someone...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, he didn't tell me.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He told Nano.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's order would've been enough to stop him.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With so many people to refuse...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me giving him the boot...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't seem fair...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you did... And for real...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He slapped me...

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I gave him the boot...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's gonna doubt you if you regret what you did!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doubt me?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can all doubt you're not all right upstairs.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I turned in?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call you at night.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can't sleep,

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Write your diary.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pour your heart out.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll give you some peace.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She went to bed.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care of her, Aunt.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care, love.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
-Bye.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's go, shall we?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over to Neelam's.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her she's agreed.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her again

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she means it.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She announced it out loud.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No room for questions now.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She named Gulrez too.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanted her to nod quietly.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But - God bless her - she said his name out loud!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I wonder what this delay's about.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You call them every other moment.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's an idea. I'll call her.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano would be delighted!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Fajr.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her wake up.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask her.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd change her decision when she gets up.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't waste this chance.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now that she's said it,

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just break the news to everyone!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Actually... No need...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell Ammi Begum.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll take care of the rest.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're overstepping your limits, Fajr!

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My sister's agreed to marry him.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So many people got their wish.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We can finally fulfil our promises.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our honour's intact.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't I be just a bit delighted?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ohhhh...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to tell Nano yourself.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme call her.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a sec.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you didn't say anything!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just a silly girl.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got a mind of her own.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Takes two and two together to get twenty.

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hope you didn't slap her or something.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's ready.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ready?

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said yes?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the slight inconvenience of getting a few broken teeth, it's done.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She still said yes?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You all plot here, don't you?

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Especially <i>you</i>, Dado...</i>

384
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,938
Life's a bleedin' chessboard to you, isn't it?

385
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,038
Pawn to F7, Queen takes Rook...

386
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,368
Checkmate.

387
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,747
You just don't want to be on the wrong end of it.

388
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,649
But there's greater grandmasters than you 'round here.

389
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:03,009
Such as this London tramp.

390
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,879
A loafer, aye. A wastrel, too, aye. But one...

391
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:11,040
Who's mastered the art of the checkmate with his English roses...

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you'd get the news... But tell me...

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How d'you intend to tan your hide?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before I do that,

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna skin her alive! Claw her eyes out and cut that tongue of hers!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you claw her eyes out and cut her tongue

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For speaking her heart out?

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seem to have got old blood with love.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I expected no better from you.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The spark within you would burn us all down.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grab a pew, Dastoor Ahmed...

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enjoy

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The heat...

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know Uncle Dastoor enjoying the heat ain't gonna cool you down, Dado!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
KNOW YOUR LIMITS!

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear those who limit the desires of hearts

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cry out, 'Know your limits'!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The times have changed, Dado.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No longer will the Nanos and Dados chain hearts...

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love brings them all to their knees.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know me, Waqar Ahmed...

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you inside out, Dado.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You play politics in love.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?
-Just a second, Uncle Dastoor...

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't even started yet.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Consumed in the intoxication of power,

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This so-called lady of 65...

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This 75-year-old <i>cow</i>, I say...</i>

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thinks the palaces of love are but sandcastles!

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I dare her to take up arms.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll be dust in no time. Poof!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The phone...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do it nice and proper.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Clean it everyday. I don't want this getting dirty.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the dust over there! Goodness!

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give your Mum the phone.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano...

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Ammi Begum?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen said yes?

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right by her.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Waqar?

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With us.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you looked on quietly?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I do?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slap properly!

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Slap who?

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit who broke everything here to punish that blighter!

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what,

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't tire of kissing his face,

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yet even he barked like mad at me today!

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said,

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Consumed in the intoxication of power',

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'This 75-year-old cow'

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Thinks the palaces of love are but sandcastles'!

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I dare her to take up arms'!

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'She'll be dust in no time. Poof'!

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd he say that?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because your sweet little girl said yes!

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he?

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left when I slapped him.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Heavens...

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You pitying him?

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would too.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been humiliated here too.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen said before him...

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she's ready to marry Gulrez.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's just one way out.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kill me one of these days.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which father in the world

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can leave

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His daughter alone in the wild world

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And live in peace?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to decide...

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you rather kill me,

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or listen

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To my side of the story someday.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving this job, ma'am.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't make a girl's father wait outside her door like that.

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave her.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Changed, of late...

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She left herself

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without asking me to leave.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're done cleaning your Foxy, come inside?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your cuppa's ready.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could I have it here?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll thank you.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart...</i>

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To marry

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
