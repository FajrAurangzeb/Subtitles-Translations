1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen and heard it myself.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He leaves on Sunday.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was arguing with his agent.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't so lucky to get a flight before Sunday.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be gone forever on Sunday.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I've asked him to.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't ever come back if you go'.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't be coming back, Maheen.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come and pick your engagement gown. They're waiting for you.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And please reject the blue one.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum wore it on her engagement.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't consider it auspicious.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young...</i>

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola underneath the rising sun...</i>

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I could give a thousand reasons why</i>

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you're going, and you know that</i>

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I don't like any of these colours...
But you're going, and you know that</i>

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like any of these colours...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please help me, Waqar?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you said you'd pick. But you're just looking at me.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking at how you're saving all your love for her.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, I'm sure this suit's gonna look very good on you. This one.
-This one?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack this one.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's check out the ties...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never bought a tie.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can help me pick a matching colour.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, sure.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about this one?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, this one's good.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you have picked this one in my place?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I would've picked that one.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack these...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bill, please?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been paid, sir.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Paid?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I paid the bill.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What am I here for? Consider it my gift on your engagement.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh yeah... For the ties.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't add this one.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'd picked this one for you.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how to tie one.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've learnt so much from you. The least I can do is teach you how to.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which of these four do you like the most?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blue one.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I go invite Jiya?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you not invite her?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... Think again before you leave.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's three other gowns here.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you folks wear these? Nano?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we are...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna sit there? Come out.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, not today.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please? I'll make you a nice cuppa.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thank you. Not used to having a nice cuppa.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come out already!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would've left if I hadn't seen you!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever gone shopping with him?
-God forgive!
-Yeah God forgive me too!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.
-Come.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Chief.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Studying hard, I see.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you two up to?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can deal with the second. Where's the third?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a third?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here yet?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you mean? I think I'm mixing the second and the third...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You-Know-Who... Waqar the Winner.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, the Jury's changed that name.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's officially Waqar the Loser now. For losing the match on purpose.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Where is he?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shopping with Gulrez. For the engagement.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you up to?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think he's poisoning his ears?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Might as well be.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what he says.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you worry? Let the world say what they want.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He bowled awfully on purpose, didn't he?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He decided to lose to Gulrez as soon as you were out.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is he so determined to lose?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chief...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never wants to lose... But he doesn't want to beat you. No idea why...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why does he give a hoot about me?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Chief... Always thinking about those who have nothing to do with you.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's back from his mission impossible after you practically beat him with your boots!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The very mention of your name wipes the expression clean from his face.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, no expression.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chief...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said a word too much.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking him to get the devil out.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think it was a bit too harsh?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... But why are you talking about that?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't beat him with my boots!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Fajr's lying?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said you smacked your boot into his face!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you did that in your fury... You don't really think, do you?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The 'get the devil out' part?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has it hurt him so much?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... Maybe...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he's actually going back?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you give two boots -- *hem* -- hoots.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trying his new suit.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit! Why couldn't he wait until the big day?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked him to try it on.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to see him wear that suit once.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say that like you won't be there at the engagement.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The engagement's three days away.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough to change the world.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows? I might not even live to see it... Or be here to attend it.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're leaving.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be so sure... I'm not sure I'll live through it.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar Ahmed.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've ruled that option out.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who bring others to life don't die in three days.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you keep it between ourselves?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise. What is it?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without attending the engagement?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be there. My flight leaves the same night. At 2.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd leave.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to, Neelam...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been two months.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't been here this long.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know you didn't come here to go back.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I also know

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why you're going.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone knows that.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I miss my English roses too much.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no one.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you want to paint yourself as a loafer, a gadabout?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just spawning hatred for you in our hearts...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And especially... In her heart... She, who lives in yours...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea what you're talking about... And no idea what's taking him so long!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know what I'm talking about.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know what you're gonna do.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Waqar,

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One moment

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has made me feel like I've wronged you.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I admit I'd fallen for Maheen, Neelam...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my love

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could never be as powerful as Gulrez's.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't think I'm pitying anyone...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm giving him what's rightfully his.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I promise you

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be coming back this time.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're leaving?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this suit?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wanted to see me in it.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you. You look fantastic.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All eyes will be fixed on you.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm getting engaged on Sunday.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Gulrez.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did the right thing... Right?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd know that.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, mate. I'm asking you.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you love Gulrez,

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or are you just showing someone?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You seriously think I'd wager my life to show someone?

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you getting engaged? You got engaged as kids.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Engagements of kids aren't really engagements.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then why are you asking me if you're doing the right thing?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because someone gave me a tip...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you think you don't know yourself well enough, ask your best friend.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always knows.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't love Gulrez.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not yet.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You never will.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you love someone else.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't love anyone!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You folks are just -- Thinking things!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You folks?</i>

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Who else told you that?

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she'd know

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who you love?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate him! That's all you should know!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed!

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate the sound of his name!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you'll see...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll prove it on Sunday...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb's heart is an open book...

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone can read it

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On her face!

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget to come, okay?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you just say...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As always, as always!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aurangzeb was my Dad.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd he die?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Car crash...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't ask me anything else...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, Jiya!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Dad!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pick you up at 8.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to ask something...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About that car crash...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was Aurangzeb with Mum in the car?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell me, Dad...

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my sake?

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he died on the spot?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could I have his picture?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His picture?

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want his picture.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care if you get late... Get here at 9 or 10...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But get me his picture.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Dad? Please?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please...?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast, partner!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the roughness of late?

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's on your mind?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the news?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much... Just... There's this engagement thingy...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be over by Sunday.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever thought

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why happier moments end so quickly?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why's there no Sunday after Sunday?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, very funny.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're calling the moon a 100-Watt bulb.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the entire blimmin' moon, Waqar!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you learn this stuff?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sacrifice teaches me.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As do lies

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That your type tell solemnly.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Truth can be a real ghost.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It comes back to haunt you.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was here for you.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saying sorry I guess?
-No.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said you'd lead Gulrez astray.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got to see him.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You need to figure out why there's no Sunday after Sunday.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Monday follows Sunday. It's for the best.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know why happiness is so short-lived?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because one man's happiness is another man's sorrow. God doesn't want such happiness to last long.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me whose sorrow this happiness could be?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe the girl who's overjoyed about it...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or maybe... You, who's too afraid to face the truth.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bout time you faced it.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or you'll have to live a lie for the rest of your life.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, love.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why d'you want his picture?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to see how ugly his type can look.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Forget it...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never thought you'd be the type who'd mistake remembering for forgetting.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me his pic.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I need to see the blighter... Remember him one last time before forgetting him...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may rehearse if you'd like.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rehearse for what?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting ringed.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't be able to put it on so suddenly.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suddenly?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may get bad news at that moment?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It may be good news for you too.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That zestful dance of his

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the beats of the drum

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is all but an act.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All his tears have altered course

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From his eyes to his heart.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're under coercion; he's persevering.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time it's time for you to wear the ring,

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be time for him to leave your life forever.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be left watching

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As he leaves.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does Nano know?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Mehru?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd told you - besides me, it's just Ali who knows.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So why don't you tell Nano?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I?

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone wants that he leave.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone thinks

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if he leaves, he will, as always, bounce back.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I swear to God, only I know

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he won't be coming back.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 11 p.m. right now.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always ask for time to decide.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this time,

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've only got a few minutes

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before Maheen Aurangzeb

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will be left cursing the hands of the clock.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pull away the veil on your face, O Beloved,</i>

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Let the curtains fall, O Beloved!</i>

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pull away the veil on your face, O Beloved,</i>

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Let the curtains fall, O Beloved!</i>

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Show me the beauty of your spring once,</i>

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time it's time for you to wear the ring,

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be time for him to leave your life forever.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By God, Matey!

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look like trouble!

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look like trouble!

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>O Beloved!</i>

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This life is dull without you</i>

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This life is dull without you</i>

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you touched in the head?

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Somebody might come to suspect I'm leaving.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no room for suspicion now.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I've told her that you're leaving.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So --

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if telling her makes things any different!

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if it did?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What absurd questions!

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like you, I don't know what you'd do.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But take it as a bit of parting advice

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she stops you from leaving,

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ever leave.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or you'll be leaving her in quite the mare's nest!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I will remember you then</i>

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it as a bit of parting advice

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she stops you from leaving,

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't ever leave.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough with it already!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will anybody call the girl or are we going to dance all the way until sunrise?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time to meet your love.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[You look] Just as God has willed!

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's waiting, c'mon!

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey --

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose picture is it in your feet?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is Dad's picture...

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How come it's here on the floor?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You might've dropped it accidentally.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen this picture of Dad's before...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've seen it now!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's waiting.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt's standing outside. Come.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look so sweet!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
