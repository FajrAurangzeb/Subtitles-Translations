1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,178
I've seen and heard it myself.

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,248
He leaves on Sunday.

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,418
He was arguing with his agent.

4
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:29,759
He wasn't so lucky as to get a flight before Sunday.

5
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:33,989
He'll be gone forever on Sunday.

6
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,819
Because I've asked him to.

7
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:39,339
'Don't ever come back if you go'.

8
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,333
He won't be coming back, Maheen.

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,937
Ever.

10
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,695
Come and pick your engagement gown. They're waiting for you.

11
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:02,859
And please reject the blue one.

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,170
Mum wore it on her engagement.

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,952
She doesn't consider it auspicious.

21
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:01,854
I don't like any of these colours...

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,258
Please help me, Waqar?

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:12,422
I thought you said you'd pick. But you're just looking at me.

24
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,430
I'm looking at how you're saving all your love for her.

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,250
Otherwise, I'm sure this suit's gonna look very good on you. This one.

26
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,733
This one?

27
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,728
Please pack this one.

28
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,660
Let's check out the ties...

29
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,218
I've never bought a tie.

30
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:40,081
You can help me pick a matching colour.

31
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:41,741
Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,333
How about this one?

33
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,919
Yeah, this one's good.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,048
Would you have picked this one in my place?

35
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,139
No. I would've picked that one.

36
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,017
This one?

37
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,153
Okay.

38
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,701
Please pack these...

39
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,018
Bill, please?

40
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:11,499
It's been paid, sir.

41
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:12,970
Paid?

42
00:03:13,138 --> 00:03:15,130
I paid the bill.

43
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,980
What am I here for?

44
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,054
Consider it my gift on your engagement.

45
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,088
Oh yeah... For the ties.

46
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,339
Thank you.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,878
Please don't add this one.

48
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:28,980
Why?

49
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,531
Because I'd picked this one for you.

50
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,518
I don't know how to tie one.

51
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,132
Waqar...

52
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:40,488
I've learnt so much from you. The least I can do is teach you how to.

53
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,058
Thank you.

54
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,178
No.

55
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,840
Thank <i>you</i>.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,488
Peace be upon you!

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,503
And upon you, peace.

58
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,814
So...

59
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,364
M'girl...

60
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:06,014
Which of these four do you like the most?

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,067
Umm...

62
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,578
Hmm?

63
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,039
Mhm!

64
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,918
This one...

65
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:39,978
I'll pick...

66
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:42,799
The blue one.

67
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,097
Should I go invite Jiya?

68
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:59,087
How could you not invite her?

69
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:05,767
But... Think again before you leave.

70
00:05:07,118 --> 00:05:12,313
There's three other gowns here.

71
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,598
Why don't you folks wear these? Nano?

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,383
Here we are...

73
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,528
You gonna sit there? Come out.

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,421
No, not today.

75
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,800
Please? I'll make you a nice cuppa.

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,531
No, thank you. Not used to having a nice cuppa.

77
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,329
Come out already!

78
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,039
You would've left if I hadn't seen you!

79
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,481
Ever gone shopping with him?

80
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,431
God forgive!

81
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,242
Yeah God forgive me too!

82
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:32,444
Come.

83
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:34,883
Come.
-Come.

84
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:48,472
Hi, Chief.

85
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:49,793
Hi.

86
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,472
Studying hard, I see.

87
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,232
What are you two up to?

88
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,933
Who else?

89
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,370
I can deal with the second.

90
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,070
Where's the third?

91
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,298
There's a third?

92
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,609
Here yet?

93
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:08,809
Who do you mean? I think I'm mixing the second and the third...

94
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,620
You-Know-Who... Waqar the Winner.

95
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,882
Well, the Jury's changed that name.

96
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:19,755
He's officially Waqar the Loser now. For losing the match on purpose.

97
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:24,056
Anyway... Where is he?

98
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,113
Shopping with Gulrez. For the engagement.

99
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,108
What're you up to?

100
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,727
Do you think he's poisoning his ears?

101
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,598
Might as well be.

102
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:43,368
Guess what he says.

103
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:49,903
Why do you worry? Let the world say what they want.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,681
He bowled awfully on purpose,

105
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,460
Didn't he?

106
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,840
Yeah.

107
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,619
But why?

108
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,938
He decided to lose to Gulrez as soon as you were out.

109
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,423
Why is he so determined to lose?

110
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,409
Chief...

111
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,780
He never wants to lose...

112
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:21,575
But he doesn't want to beat you. No idea why...

113
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,950
Why does he give a hoot about me?

114
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,468
Oh, Chief...

115
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,949
Always thinking about those who have nothing to do with you.

116
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,988
He's back from his mission impossible after you practically beat him with your boots!

117
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:43,788
The very mention of your name wipes the expression clean from his face. Like a fused bulb!

118
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,938
As in, no expression.

119
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,969
Chief...

120
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:55,350
You said a word too much.

121
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:56,819
What?

122
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,419
Asking him to get the devil out.

123
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:04,270
Don't you think it was a bit too harsh?

124
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,530
Yeah... But why are you talking about that?

125
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,237
I didn't beat him with my boots!

126
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:12,078
So Fajr's lying?

127
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:14,649
What'd she say?

128
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:18,379
She said you smacked your boot into his face!

129
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,158
I'm sure you did that in your fury... You don't really think, do you?

130
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,048
The 'get the devil out' part?

131
00:09:28,048 --> 00:09:30,138
Has it hurt him so much?

132
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,187
Yeah...

133
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:32,789
Maybe...

134
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,557
So he's actually going back?

135
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:42,738
As if you give two boots -- *hem* -- hoots.

136
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,939
Where's Gulrez?

137
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,024
Trying his new suit.

138
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:26,395
The twit! Why couldn't he wait until the big day?

139
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,888
I asked him to try it on.

140
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,298
Why?

141
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,759
I wanted to see him wear that suit once.

142
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:41,371
You say that like you won't be there at the engagement.

143
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:44,918
The engagement's three days away.

144
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,808
Enough to change the world.

145
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,408
Who knows? I might not even live to see it... Or be here to attend it.

146
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,208
So you're leaving.

147
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,749
I won't be so sure...

148
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,059
I'm not sure I'll live through it.

149
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:07,000
No, Waqar Ahmed.

150
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,828
You've ruled that option out.

151
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,898
Those who bring others to life don't die in three days.

152
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,221
Would you keep it between ourselves?

153
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:26,031
I promise. What is it?

154
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,388
I'm leaving.

155
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,607
Without attending the engagement?

156
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:40,389
I'll be there. My flight leaves the same night. At 2.

157
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,929
I knew you'd leave.

158
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,488
I had to, Neelam...

159
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,879
It's been two months.

160
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,628
I haven't been here this long.

161
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,588
I know you didn't come here to go back.

162
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,438
I also know

163
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,568
Why you're going.

164
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,237
Everyone knows that.

165
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:12,149
I miss my English roses too much.

166
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,888
Can it.

167
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,959
There's no one.

168
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,088
Why d'you want to paint yourself as a loafer, a gadabout?

169
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:26,419
You're just spawning hatred for you in our hearts...

170
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:30,730
And especially... In <i>her</i> heart... She, who lives in yours...

171
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,108
No idea what you're talking about... And no idea what's taking him so long!

172
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,691
You know what I'm talking about.

173
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,929
I know what you're gonna do.

174
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,017
Know what, Waqar,

175
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,027
One moment

176
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:09,578
Has made me feel like I've wronged you.

177
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,898
I admit I'd fallen for Maheen, Neelam...

178
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,888
But my love

179
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,838
Could never be as powerful as Gulrez's.

180
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,558
So...

181
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,988
Don't think I'm pitying anyone...

182
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,588
I'm giving him what's rightfully his.

183
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,837
And I promise you

184
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,209
I won't be coming back this time.

185
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,968
You're leaving?

186
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,198
Yeah.

187
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,898
And this suit?

188
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,248
You wanted to see me in it.

189
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,773
Bless you. You look fantastic.

190
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,239
All eyes will be fixed on you.

191
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,597
See you.

192
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,201
I'm getting engaged on Sunday.

193
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,029
To Gulrez.

194
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,568
I did the right thing... Right?

195
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,548
You'd know that.

196
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:54,268
No, mate. I'm asking you.

197
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:55,908
Tell me.

198
00:14:56,188 --> 00:15:00,032
Do you love Gulrez,

199
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:03,318
Or are you just showing someone?

200
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:07,568
You seriously think I'd wager my life to show someone?

201
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:12,539
Why are you getting engaged? You got engaged as kids.

202
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,820
Engagements of kids aren't really engagements.

203
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,832
Then why are you asking me if you're doing the right thing?

204
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,061
Because someone gave me a tip...

205
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:29,521
If you think you don't know yourself well enough, ask your best friend.

206
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,419
She always knows.

207
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,349
You don't love Gulrez.

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,309
<i>Yet</i>!

209
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,090
You never will.

210
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,931
Why?

211
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,859
Because you love someone else.

212
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,489
I don't love anyone!

213
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:04,829
You folks are just -- Thinking things!

214
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:06,539
You <i>folks</i>?

215
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,711
So... Who else told you that?

216
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,418
Aye?

217
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:14,948
Fajr.

218
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,958
I'm sure she'd know

219
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,508
Who you love?

220
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:25,256
I hate him! That's all you should know!

221
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,520
Waqar Ahmed!

222
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,908
I swear...

223
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,518
I hate the sound of his name!

224
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,377
And you'll see...

225
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,911
I'll prove it on Sunday...

226
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,868
Maheen Aurangzeb's heart is an open book...

227
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,488
Everyone can read it

228
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,968
On her face!

229
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,293
Don't forget to come, okay?

230
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,097
Hey...

231
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,139
Did you just say...

232
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:05,170
Maheen <i>Aurangzeb</i>?

233
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,120
As always, as always!

234
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,731
Aurangzeb was my Dad.

235
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,968
Aye...

236
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:18,248
How'd he die?

237
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,383
Car crash...

238
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:27,160
Please don't ask me anything else...

239
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,820
Hello, Jiya!

240
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,268
Hey, Dad!

241
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,637
I'll pick you up at 8.

242
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,381
I want to ask something...

243
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:02,962
Yes?

244
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,124
About that car crash...

245
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:11,188
Was

246
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,209
Aurangzeb with Mum in the car?

247
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,029
Please tell me, Dad...

248
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,808
For my sake?

249
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,441
Yes.

250
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,842
And he died on the spot?

251
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,988
Aye.

252
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,648
Could I have his picture?

253
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,238
His picture?

254
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,037
Why?

255
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,908
I said

256
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:15,722
I want his picture.

257
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:19,858
I don't care if you get late... Get here at 9 or 10...

258
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,859
But get me his picture.

259
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,905
Please, Dad? Please?

260
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,469
Please...?

261
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,668
Not so fast, partner!

262
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,190
What's with the roughness of late?

263
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,395
What's on your mind?

264
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,970
What's the news?

265
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,758
Nothing much... Just... There's this engagement thingy...

266
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:42,889
Good.

267
00:20:42,968 --> 00:20:45,178
It'll be over by Sunday.

268
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,509
Ever thought

269
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,769
Why happier moments end so quickly?

270
00:20:50,811 --> 00:20:53,711
Why's there no Sunday after Sunday?

271
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,292
Very funny.

272
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:57,262
Aye, very funny.

273
00:20:57,262 --> 00:21:00,213
You're calling the moon a 100-Watt bulb.

274
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:03,722
It's the entire blimmin' moon, Waqar!

275
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,243
Where'd you learn this stuff?

276
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,265
Sacrifice teaches me.

277
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,105
As do lies

278
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,380
That your type tell solemnly.

279
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,089
Truth can be a real ghost.

280
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,197
It comes back to haunt you.

281
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,654
Get it?

282
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,335
She was here for you.

283
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,679
Who?

284
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:50,349
Maheen.

285
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,450
Saying sorry I guess?
-No.

286
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,501
She said you'd lead Gulrez astray.

287
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,098
But...

288
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,379
You've got to see him.

289
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:06,789
Why?

290
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,699
You need to figure out why there's no Sunday after Sunday.

291
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,280
I know.

292
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:16,732
Monday follows Sunday. It's for the best.

293
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:19,669
Know why happiness is so short-lived?

294
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,591
Because one man's happiness is another man's sorrow. God doesn't want such happiness to last long.

295
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,074
Okay...

296
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,387
Care to tell me whose sorrow this happiness could be?

297
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:35,178
Maybe the girl who's overjoyed about it...

298
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:36,320
Or maybe...

299
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,066
You, who's too afraid to face the truth.

300
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,058
'Bout time you faced it.

301
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:49,699
Or you'll have to live a lie for the rest of your life.

I want to see how ugly his type can look.

Forget it.

Just... Forget it...

Dad...

310
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:55,181
Never thought you'd be the type who'd mistake remembering for forgetting.

311
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,938
Show me his pic.

Rehearse for what?

318
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,688
Getting ringed.

319

Why?

320
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,218
You won't be able to put it on so suddenly.

Suddenly?

It may be good news for you too.

325

327
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,852

From his eyes to his heart.

330
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,468
You're under coercion; he's persevering.

331

By the time it's time for you to wear the ring,

335
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,717
Leaves.

336
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,598
Does Nano know?

337
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:36,920
No.

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,907
And --

339
00:26:39,907 --> 00:26:41,737
Aunt Mehru?

340
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,315
I told you - besides me, it's just Ali who knows.

341
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,751
So why don't you tell Nano?

342
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:49,414
Why should I?

343
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:52,185
Everyone wants him to leave.

344
00:26:53,518 --> 00:26:55,765
Everyone thinks

345
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:59,265
That if he leaves, he will, as always, bounce back.

346
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,961
But I swear to God,

347
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,057
Only I know

348
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:07,002
That he won't be coming back.

349
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,148
It's 11 p.m. right now.

350
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:31,668
You always ask for time to decide.

351
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,508
But this time,

352
00:27:35,258 --> 00:27:37,879
You've only got a few minutes

353
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,078
Before Maheen Aurangzeb

354
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,108
Will be left cursing the hands of the clock.

There's no room for suspicion now.

400

Because I've told <i>her</i> you're leaving.

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,659
So --

402

As if telling her makes things any different!

00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:26,250

But take it as a bit of parting advice

407
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,341
If she stops you from leaving,

Don't ever leave.

409

Hey --

425
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,051
Whose picture is it in your feet?

426
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,438
This is Dad's picture...

427
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,578
How come it's here on the floor?

428
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,918
You might've dropped it accidentally.

429
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,043
I've never seen this picture of Dad's before...

430

You've seen it now!

431
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,168
Come!

432
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,736
Everyone's waiting.

433
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,238
Aunt's standing outside. Come.

434
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,960
You look so sweet!
