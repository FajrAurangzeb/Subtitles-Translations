1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen and heard it myself.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He leaves on Sunday.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was arguing with his agent.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't so lucky to get a flight before Sunday.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be gone forever on Sunday.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I've asked him to.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't ever come back if you go'.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't be coming back, Maheen.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come and pick your engagement gown. They're waiting for you.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And please reject the blue one.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum wore it on her engagement.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't consider it auspicious.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up, we can stay forever young...</i>

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola underneath the rising sun...</i>

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I could give a thousand reasons why</i>

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you're going, and you know that</i>

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like any of these colours...
<i>But you're going, and you know that</i>

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like any of these colours...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please help me, Waqar?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you said you'd pick. But you're just looking at me.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking at how you're saving all your love for her.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, I'm sure this suit's gonna look very good on you. This one.
-This one?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack this one.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's check out the ties...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never bought a tie.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can help me pick a matching colour.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, sure.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How about this one?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, this one's good.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you have picked this one in my place?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I would've picked that one.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please pack these...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bill, please?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been paid, sir.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Paid?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I paid the bill.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What am I here for? Consider it my gift on your engagement.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh yeah... For the ties.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't add this one.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'd picked this one for you.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how to tie one.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've learnt so much from you. The least I can do is teach you how to.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you!

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which of these four do you like the most?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one...

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blue one.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I go invite Jiya?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could you not invite her?

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But... Think again before you leave.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's three other gowns here.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you folks wear these? Nano?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we are...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna sit there? Come out.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, not today.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please? I'll make you a nice cuppa.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, thank you. Not used to having a nice cuppa.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come out already!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would've left if I hadn't seen you!

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever gone shopping with him?
-God forgive!
-Yeah God forgive me too!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.
-Come.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Chief.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Studying hard, I see.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you two up to?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can deal with the second. Where's the third?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a third?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here yet?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who do you mean? I think I'm mixing the second and the third...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You-Know-Who... Waqar the Winner.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, the Jury's changed that name.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's officially Waqar the Loser now. For losing the match on purpose.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway... Where is he?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shopping with Gulrez. For the engagement.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you up to?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think he's poisoning his ears?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Might as well be.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what he says.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why do you worry? Let the world say what they want.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He bowled awfully on purpose, didn't he?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He decided to lose to Gulrez as soon as you were out.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is he so determined to lose?

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chief...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never wants to lose... But he doesn't want to beat you. No idea why...

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why does he give a hoot about me?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, Chief... Always thinking about those who have nothing to do with you.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's back from his mission impossible after you practically beat him with your boots!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The very mention of your name wipes the expression clean from his face.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, no expression.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chief...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said a word too much.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Asking him to get the devil out.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think it was a bit too harsh?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... But why are you talking about that?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't beat him with my boots!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So Fajr's lying?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she say?

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said you smacked your boot into his face!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you did that in your fury... You don't really think, do you?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The 'get the devil out' part?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has it hurt him so much?

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah... Maybe...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So he's actually going back?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you give two boots -- *hem* -- hoots.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Trying his new suit.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit! Why couldn't he wait until the big day?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked him to try it on.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to see him wear that suit once.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You say that like you won't be there at the engagement.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The engagement's three days away.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough to change the world.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows? I might not even live to see it... Or be here to attend it.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're leaving.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be so sure... I'm not sure I'll live through it.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar Ahmed.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've ruled that option out.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who bring others to life don't die in three days.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you keep it between ourselves?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise. What is it?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without attending the engagement?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be there. My flight leaves the same night. At 2.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew you'd leave.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to, Neelam...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been two months.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't been here this long.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
ADD

147
00:24:57,313 --> 00:25:06,384
<i>O Beloved!</i>

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may rehearse if you'd like.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rehearse for what?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting ringed.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't be able to put it on so suddenly.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suddenly?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You may get bad news at that moment?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It may be good news for you too.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That zestful dance of his

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the beats of the drum

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is all but an act.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All his tears have altered course

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
From his eyes to his heart.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're under coercion; he's persevering.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the time it's time for you to wear the ring,

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be time for him to leave your life forever.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be left watching

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As he leaves.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does Nano know?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And --

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Mehru?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd told you - besides me, it's just Ali who knows.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So why don't you tell Nano?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why should I?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone wants that he leave.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone thinks

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if he leaves, he will, as always, bounce back.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I swear to God, only I know

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he won't be coming back.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 11 p.m. right now.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always ask for time to decide.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this time,

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've only got a few minutes

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before Maheen Aurangzeb

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will be left cursing the hands of the clock.

185
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:23,115
<i>O Beloved!</i>

186
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:27,708
<i>Pull away the veil on your face, O Beloved,</i>

187
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:32,085
<i>Let the curtains fall, O Beloved!</i>

188
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,885
<i>Pull away the veil on your face, O Beloved,</i>

189
00:28:36,895 --> 00:28:41,315
<i>Let the curtains fall, O Beloved!</i>

190
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:53,706
<i>O Beloved!</i>

191
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,359
<i>O Beloved!</i>

192
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:11,598
<i>O Beloved!</i>

193
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:27,439
<i>Show me the beauty of your spring once,</i>

194
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,210
By the time it's time for you to wear the ring,

195
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,680
It'd be time for him to leave your life forever.

196
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:10,830
By God, Matey!

197
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,661
You look like trouble!

198
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,693
You look like trouble!

199
00:30:19,155 --> 00:30:20,325
Show me.

200
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:53,389
<i>O Beloved!</i>

201
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:18,131
<i>This life is dull without you</i>

202
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:26,601
<i>This life is dull without you</i>

203
00:31:27,392 --> 00:31:40,311
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

204
00:31:41,623 --> 00:31:54,673
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

205
00:31:55,472 --> 00:32:04,102
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

206
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:15,352
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

207
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:34,724
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

208
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:47,309
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

209
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:56,644
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

210
00:32:56,729 --> 00:33:06,803
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

211
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:09,774
Are you touched in the head?

212
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,366
Somebody might come to suspect I'm leaving.

213
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:14,535
There's no room for suspicion now.

214
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,806
Because I've told her that you're leaving.

215
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,881
So --

216
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,520
As if telling her makes things any different!

217
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,300
And if it did?

218
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,015
What absurd questions!

219
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,682
Like you, I don't know what you'd do.

220
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,533
But take it as a bit of parting advice

221
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,063
If she stops you from leaving,

222
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:42,954
Don't ever leave.

223
00:33:47,064 --> 00:33:50,205
Or you'll be leaving her in quite the mare's nest!

224
00:33:53,216 --> 00:34:02,639
<i>I will keep with me the memories of our conversations and of you</i>

225
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:11,965
<i>Such bounties, O Love, are all one gets from you in benefaction</i>

226
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:21,385
<i>I will laugh wholeheartedly at this, I will embrace the heart with rapture</i>

227
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:30,314
<i>I will remember you then</i>

228
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:04,115
Take it as a bit of parting advice

229
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,726
If she stops you from leaving,

230
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:09,648
Don't ever leave.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough with it already!

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will anybody call the girl or are we going to dance all the way until sunrise?

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time to meet your love.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
[You look] Just as God has willed!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's waiting, c'mon!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey --

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose photograph is it in your feet?

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is Dad's photograph...

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How come it's here on the floor?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You might've dropped it accidentally.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've never seen this photo of Dad's before...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've seen it now!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's waiting.

246
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:40,076
Aunt's standing outside. Come.

247
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:42,978
You look so sweet!

248
00:35:44,918 --> 00:35:49,918
