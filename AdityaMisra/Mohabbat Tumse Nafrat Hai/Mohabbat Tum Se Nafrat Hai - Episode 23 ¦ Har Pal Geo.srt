1
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:30,840
You'd dance again today?

2
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,571
On leave today.

3
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:33,605
Tomorrow.

4
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:36,040
You'd dance at the wedding tomorrow?

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,356
I'd promised Fajr.

6
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:38,810
Have some shame.

7
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,871
Shame?

8
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,821
About what?

9
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,480
What do you want to prove?

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,871
That you don't have the slightest grief?

11
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:49,996
C'mon, mate.

12
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:52,075
I have a lot of grief.

13
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:54,199
But so what?

14
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,139
They're happy, and that's all that matters.

15
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:01,045
He's a friend... My elder brother.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,969
And she's my cousin...

17
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,246
Ex-fiancée.

18
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:07,541
Shouldn't I be delighted?

19
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,497
A friend of mine, a doctor -

20
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:13,726
He says, 'If you have to brave some grief',

21
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:15,231
'Run a race'.

22
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,606
'Exercise'.

23
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:23,950
Someone said on TV yesterday

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,611
That dancing is the best workout.

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,690
Would you look at how intelligent I've become!

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,299
I can see that...

27
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,735
Tell me,

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,891
What'd you wear tomorrow? The same old suit?

29
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,411
No.

30
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,990
I've bought a new sherwani.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,693
I'll don it and stand right next to the groom.

32
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,518
They'll be asking,

33
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,603
'Who's the groom'?

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,074
<i>Everyone</i> knows

35
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:25,621
Who the groom is.

36
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,541
I've heard you've met.

37
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:20,466
Care to tell what happened?

38
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,996
Just the usual. Chatting around...

39
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,884
Topped with a quarrel.

40
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,489
Another quarrel?

41
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:31,752
She doesn't forget the slap from four years ago, Dado...

42
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,891
She will.

43
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,286
How?

44
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,498
Hit her back with one after the marriage.

45
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,861
She'll forget the old one.

46
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,419
Splendid, Dastoor Ahmed.

47
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,670
You remind me of my mistakes every time you speak.

48
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,384
What mistakes?

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,857
If I'd taken him to the doctor in his younger days, Dastoor wouldn't have been like this...

50
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,327
Just listen quietly...

51
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,795
It's better if you don't speak.

52
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:11,622
Sure.

53
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,446
And yes, laddie...

54
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,741
She was talking politely, right?

55
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,593
Yes.

56
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:23,548
Give her a gift

57
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:26,675
On the night of the wedding.

58
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:27,832
What, Dado?

59
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:33,680
Bring your cheek forward and say, 'Slap me right here',

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,346
'But please forget the slap four years ago'.

61
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,341
As if she'd forget!

62
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,868
She'd be embarrassed, to say the least.

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,740
Alright, leave the slap.

64
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,613
Tell me, did you talk about anything <i>else</i> of a particular sort?

65
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,100
Of a <i>particular</i> sort, Dado?

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,681
The romantic sort.

67
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,196
Blimey, Ammi Begum!

68
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:06,140
You're speaking English!

69
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,025
I can't help it if he doesn't understand otherwise!

70
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,195
Tell me, will you, you twit?

71
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,995
Nothing much, really.

72
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:22,936
Did you say 'I love you'?

73
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,494
No?

74
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:25,746
You muppet!

75
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:27,705
Why not?

76
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:33,047
Boys say it straight to the face.

77
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,440
I was about to say it when Fajr got there.

78
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,092
Alright...

79
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,636
The show's finally on the road, eh?

80
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:50,650
And yes,

81
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,040
Where's your 'friend'?

82
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:56,184
'Friend'?

83
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,825
I mean --

84
00:05:57,825 --> 00:06:01,842
Your mate, your Jiya...

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:10,639
She's turned stone-cold ever since she heard about your marriage. Doesn't even come here.

86
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,855
She doesn't even try

87
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,916
To kidnap you.

88
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,636
Honestly,

89
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:24,902
Something's fishy, innit?

90
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,241
No. I've talked to her.

91
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:33,243
She's coming to Maheen's and would stay there until tomorrow.

92
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,744
Save your experienced eyes.

93
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:41,319
Looking too far will only harm your sight.

94
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm done.

95
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,531
I'll write my diary for the last time tomorrow,

96
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,979
And I'll end it with

97
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,620
'My Waqar' [=my honour, pride].

98
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,949
I'll leave a margin.

99
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:28,424
You will write the rest.

100
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:33,690
I leave every word of my fate for you to write.

101
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,294
Just keep picking words

102
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:40,014
And penning the story.

103
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,760
I used to write,

104
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,536
'This happened today'.

105
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:47,103
You will write

106
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,807
What happens tomorrow.

107
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,940
There, now!

108
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,380
Hey!

109
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,831
Let go!

110
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:17,699
Easy there!

111
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,600
What happened?

112
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,978
Nothing.

113
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,581
I just felt like

114
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:32,372
Hugging you and crying on your shoulder...

115
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,443
Honestly, why are you crying?

116
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,206
You wouldn't tell anyone, would you?

117
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,080
I won't.

118
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,754
I promise.

119
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,091
I was thinking while writing my diary

120
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:58,924
That I've picked a fight with him so many times,

121
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:02,544
Hated him so much for so long...

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,978
But for what?

123
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:11,186
He'd slapped you!

124
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,069
What's the big deal about that?

125
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,690
I gave him his deserts proper!

126
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,065
Blimey...

127
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,956
You're softening up for him!

128
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,320
I've only realised now, Jiya,

129
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,651
That I love him so much.

130
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,670
I would've died without him.

131
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,164
She had a golden bindiya on when I entered the room.

132
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:06,306
By my bindiya!

133
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,435
Hold it, Mum!

134
00:10:08,968 --> 00:10:10,306
Eh?

135
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,296
Alright, go on.

136
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,903
Seeing me, she jumped up, saying,

137
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:22,215
'Have some shame! You can't enter a girl's room without her permission'!

138
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:25,265
I said, 'It's my Dado's room'!

139
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:27,798
Touché...

140
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:29,533
Go on.

141
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,340
I took the next step...

142
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,341
The <i>next</i> step?

143
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,660
Let me finish, Dado.

144
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,974
'Slowly edging forward! You're looking like a villain'!

145
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:53,886
I said, 'Look at yourself, Maheen! Mistaking the hero for the villain'!

146
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,371
She must've said, 'Whatever will become of you, you shameless twit'...

147
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:02,243
Aye.

148
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,821
That's exactly what she said.

149
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,898
Go on.

150
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,294
And when she started running, I grabbed her han --

151
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,386
Gordon Bennet...

152
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,901
That's it.

153
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,499
La fin.

154
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:22,951
What?

155
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:28,971
Didn't you let go after you grabbed her hand?

156
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,659
How could I ever, Dado?

157
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,212
I love her so much.

158
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,856
Bless you.

159
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,781
God bless you!

160
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,861
May I go?

161
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:59,840
Go, my dear.

162
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,603
It was a pleasure to hear it!

163
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,451
Thank you.

164
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,976
May I go?

165
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,590
Would you rather sit here with us?

166
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,685
Look at your age!

167
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,644
Very funny!

168
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,161
Hello?

169
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,930
Is it Waqar Ahmed?

170
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,100
You've called Waqar; Who else can it be?

171
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,815
May I compliment you?

172
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,311
Please.

173
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:23,456
You're dirty rotten!

174
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,126
A flip like no other in the entire blimming world!

175
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,525
I never thought you could fall so low and flat,

176
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,750
That you'd be so cheap

177
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,331
As to tell everyone about your meeting with your lover like a tale!

178
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,860
You even said you'd grabbed my hand!

179
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,326
God forgive me!

180
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,190
And you told all about it to your Dado, Uncle and Aunt!

181
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,586
Good Lord...

182
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:52,336
I'm marrying <i>that</i> type!

183
00:13:52,336 --> 00:13:54,151
Wait and listen, Maheen...

184
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:56,526
I've heard everything you had to tell.

185
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:59,028
That was just a joke, Maheen.

186
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:02,024
Dado was nagging and I gave in.

187
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,742
Tell Jiya, too,

188
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,371
Should she nag you tomorrow!

189
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,562
Then some other friend,

190
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:08,982
Or neighbour.

191
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,557
What's it to you?

192
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:12,354
Are you in your senses?

193
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:15,689
I've been knocked for bleedin' six, Waqar Ahmed!

194
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,925
I'm ashamed of myself.

195
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,771
About what?

196
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:21,963
Fair enough.

197
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:24,851
Your type doesn't even know what shame is.

198
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,870
It's no big deal, Maheen.

199
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,747
Everyone was delighted to hear it, so I thought I did the right thing.

200
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:32,775
But if it's hurt you, I'm sorry.

201
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,911
What was that?

202
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:37,890
It's difficult...

203
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,782
What's difficult?

204
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,343
I can't figure it out...

205
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:45,160
I think I've taken the wrong decision.

206
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,454
Stop it, Maheen. I'm saying sorry, ain't I?

207
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,918
You'd better not!

208
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:52,136
I don't like sorries!

209
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,861
Why are you lying?

210
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:56,610
You'd said the other day, 'Keep saying sorry to me'

211
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,875
'As long as I live'.

212
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,886
You told them about that, too?

213
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:03,416
No, Maheen, I didn't tell <i>everything</i>.

214
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,880
Go ahead and tell them.

215
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,432
It's no big deal.

216
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,477
It's not like anyone's stopping you.

217
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:10,840
I swear by you it didn't hurt me.

218
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,135
Recounting it, I was so happy...

219
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:16,445
I felt you were with me,

220
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,494
And I was telling you that I've just met you...

221
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,698
Why?

222
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:24,506
Why did you feel so happy?

223
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,261
Because I love you.

224
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,373
I love you very much.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,501
Done?

226
00:15:42,673 --> 00:15:44,243
Done with what?

227
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,216
Is everyone sleeping?

228
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,297
Why are you asking that?

229
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,313
Go and tell everyone, will you?

230
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:54,499
Go and tell them, 'I've said "I love you" to Maheen'!

231
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:55,983
No.

232
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:58,673
I won't tell them anything now.

233
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,860
Why?

234
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,373
Aren't you happy now?

235
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:04,336
Don't you feel

236
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,866
That I'm sitting before you

237
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:09,368
And you're saying to me, 'I love you, Maheen'?

238
00:16:10,106 --> 00:16:11,086
You blighter!

239
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,501
You said every bleedin' thing, but saved <i>this</i> for last!

240
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,641
I think I'm rather afraid of you.

241
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,876
You'd better.

242
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,031
I can change my mood any moment.

243
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:23,213
And promise me

244
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,948
That you'll always fear me.

245
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:28,947
I promise.

246
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,745
Saying out of fear, eh?

247
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,765
Yes.

248
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,703
Love me a lot, eh?

249
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:41,831
That's it, aye.

250
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:45,046
I don't fear anyone just like that.

251
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,922
Guess what,

252
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,906
Someone's been listening in!

253
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,155
I know Jiya's sitting by your side.

254
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,747
Hey...

255
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,350
Never fear me,

256
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,756
Because I love you very much, too.

257
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,390
No.

258
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,550
The groom would get here in the evening.

259
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,308
He'll get ready

260
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:06,106
And leave for over there.

261
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:08,881
I mean, it should at least feel something like a wedding procession!

262
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,170
Don't worry, Jiya, there'll be a grand procession for the wedding. You'll see.

263
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,860
Alright, get here quickly.

264
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,271
What'd Jiya say?

265
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:46,070
She says the groom will get ready here, and the bride at Nano's.

266
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,186
Good idea!

267
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:52,796
I mean, what's with calling the bride and groom from different rooms

268
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,564
To sit on either side of the priest?

269
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:57,076
I won't like it that way.

270
00:18:57,076 --> 00:19:01,311
Yeah, it'd be great. If only Ammi Begum agreed to it.

271
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,210
I'll talk to her!

272
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,878
Hold on! Finish your breakfast!

273
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,470
Just look at her!

274
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,178
She used to live like a widow when she was getting engaged to Gulrez!

275
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:14,005
I was the first one to figure out

276
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,778
That she loves Waqar.

277
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,623
How did you figure out?

278
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,202
Blimey, Mummykins,

279
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,892
Could anyone hate such a handsome cousin of hers?

280
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,643
She was just putting up an act

281
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:30,620
Of how much she hates him!

282
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,313
Almost accosting everyone,

283
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:37,911
'Has anyone got the brains to see how much I love him'?

284
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,295
Yes?

285
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:51,910
The groom would get ready and leave from over here.

286
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,218
And

287
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:54,749
The bride?

288
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,558
She'd be at her Nano's.

289
00:19:57,558 --> 00:19:59,201
As in

290
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,810
He's bringing a procession.

291
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,010
Obviously.

292
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,836
There'd be a grand procession at the wedding.

293
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,793
Good idea.

294
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,696
The women would be delighted.

295
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,216
Innit?

296
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,660
I say it from my heart, My Lady!

297
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,290
Alright,

298
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,281
I'll ask Munshi Alam to decorate my car.

299
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,216
No.

300
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:26,904
Not your car.

301
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,709
Gulrez's.

302
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:30,406
The...

303
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,184
Foxy?

304
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:33,216
Yes.

305
00:20:33,216 --> 00:20:34,859
The Foxy.

306
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:36,702
There, now!

307
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,843
Haven't his trials ended?

308
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:42,844
This is no trial, Nano.

309
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:45,286
It's the dying wish of the departed.

310
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,660
Alright, I get it. We'll talk later.

311
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,577
We're picking the best lehenga for you.

312
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:56,487
I'm deciding, too.

313
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,036
Love you, Nano.

314
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:06,096
Bring your ear over here.

315
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,580
Yes?

316
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,290
Love you too!

317
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,730
Crazy lass...

318
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:34,156
Gulrez's Foxy?

319
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,139
I'd ride <i>that</i>?

320
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:37,776
Splendid.

321
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,012
It's <i>her</i> wish, laddie.

322
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,150
But why?

323
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,390
Because it's <i>his</i> wish.

324
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,291
His last wish.

325
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,504
He, as in,

326
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:54,923
Gulrez?

327
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:59,567
Who else could have a last wish these days?

328
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,299
He's the poor lad...

329
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,231
Alrighty, M. Gulrez...

330
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,844
The wedding procession will be led by your Foxy.

331
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:12,746
Happy?

332
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,251
Wow...

333
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,975
As the Lord wished! [praise]

334
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:46,690
I've gotten the AC working so well it'll give you the chills!

335
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,331
Good Lord!

336
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:51,701
Let me ride it too, Gulrez! Please!

337
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,526
We'll go for a ride, sure!

338
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:56,773
Once we've dropped the bride home.

339
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,364
Sure.

340
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,598
Come.

341
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:01,968
Over here.

342
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,518
Look at this.

343
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,650
These earrings...

344
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,930
He'd gotten these made from his first paycheque...

345
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,825
And these bangles when he'd been promoted.

346
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,950
And this pendant...

347
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,730
He'd bought it on the tenth anniversary of his engagement.

348
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,033
And this bindiya...

349
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,970
Know what, Wali...

350
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,470
When she was younger,

351
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:49,736
She'd take the bindiya out of Nano's jewellery box, put it on, and show everyone.

352
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,370
When he's in the mood, Gulrez says,

353
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,530
'The bindiya suits her'.

354
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,768
What'd you do with these?

355
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:05,831
What could I do?

356
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,960
I'd put these on her today.

357
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,306
We'd send her

358
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:17,236
Decked up as a proper bride.

359
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,163
Here.

360
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,793
He's my brother, too.

361
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,450
And yes,

362
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,650
The lehenga she's wearing today

363
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,170
Is the one I'd bought...

364
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,490
I said,

365
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,070
'A proper bride'

366
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,410
'From our side'...

367
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,930
Just think this marriage is more of a conspiracy.

368
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,908
Guess what's gonna happen to her right after the marriage!
-What?

369
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,870
She won't be the Chief of the gang anymore.

370
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,200
Because a married girl cannot be the Chief.

371
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,286
Yes!

372
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:39,426
There!

373
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:41,306
Now you get it!

374
00:26:41,306 --> 00:26:45,670
And the new Chief will be...

375
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,736
Gulrez!

376
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:49,549
What's going on, folks?

377
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,769
C'mon, my dear.

378
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,736
Get your things and put them in Gulrez's Foxy.

379
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:58,328
And get go -- It's 6!

380
00:26:58,876 --> 00:27:00,706
6 already?

381
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,856
Alright, who's coming with me?

382
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:05,665
Just

383
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,383
Just me.

384
00:27:09,868 --> 00:27:10,990
Alright, Dado...

385
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,944
I'll call my friends here.

386
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:16,896
Just a minute.
-I give you five minutes.

387
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:19,959
I want to see you after that.

388
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,180
There, now!

389
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,911
The Reverend's here already.

390
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:32,730
Good evening.
-Good evening, Reverend. Please, come in.

391
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,696
Good evening, Reverend.

392
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,453
Hurry up, Jiya, he's started already!

393
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,310
Hey!

394
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,404
Why the hurry?

395
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:49,781
How 'bout a meeting before the wedding?

396
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,360
Put a sock in it!

397
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,470
He ain't catching a glimpse of me before the wedding.

398
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,646
No way!

399
00:27:54,646 --> 00:27:56,351
Double time!

400
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,411
Hold on.

401
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,319
Let me get ready...

402
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,662
I want to see

403
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:06,815
How he looks at anyone else with you there!

404
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:11,313
Envying me, eh?

405
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:13,499
A lot. I swear.

406
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,251
Do you know how?

407
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,980
How?

408
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,509
The way one looks at losers.

409
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,232
C'mon, now!

410
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:30,699
Coming.

411
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Sit down.

412
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,735
How's it going?

413
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:20,331
Honestly!

414
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:22,252
I swear by you,

415
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm delighted

416
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,671
To see two lovers meet.

417
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:30,898
So delighted I can't believe it.

418
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:33,305
Forgive her.

419
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,841
Are you nuts?

420
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,810
Forgive her for what?

421
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,235
Didn't I say,

422
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,156
I'm very delighted?

423
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,816
And what about <i>your</i> love?

424
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,361
Would it ever let you be delighted?

425
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:52,569
Let me tell you something...

426
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:54,990
One never demands something in love.

427
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,046
One commands.

428
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,635
To love back is a favour,

429
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,338
Nor an obligation.

430
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:07,023
C'mon, now, my dear.

431
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:08,977
Be happy.

432
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,942
Gulrez...

433
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,010
Maheen's texted me...

434
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:25,008
She's asked me to request you

435
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,480
To hold her hand

436
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,429
And bring her to the Reverend

437
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:31,818
When she's ready,

438
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:33,900
And whisper to her,

439
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,725
'I forgive you, Maheen'.

440
00:30:37,192 --> 00:30:39,615
It's <i>her</i> wish.

441
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:42,787
Or else, she wrote,

442
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:45,317
She'd apologise to you before everyone.

443
00:30:45,317 --> 00:30:59,674
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

444
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:13,918
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

445
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,024
C'mon, mate, talk about something, or just put some music on.

446
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:27,740
I'm very worried, Jiya.

447
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,664
I'm afraid I might just die if I, as the bride, saw him.

448
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:34,992
Are you out of your mind?

449
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:37,556
As if seeing your groom could kill you!

450
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:38,865
Not the groom!

451
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:40,708
Gulrez...

452
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,481
Alright, then,

453
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:44,852
I'll ask Gulrez to stay away

454
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:47,136
Until after your marriage.

455
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,431
No way, mate.

456
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,436
I've asked him to hold my hand

457
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,503
And bring me downstairs when I'm ready.

458
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,210
Brilliant...

459
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,255
'Toro, c'mon'!

460
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,069
Yes.

461
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:05,066
Because if I've wronged him, I want that I die to see him.

462
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,532
Jeez, mate!

463
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,772
What is it?

464
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,311
Your hurries made a mess!

465
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:15,921
I've left my bag back there!

466
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:17,891
Jeez...

467
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,746
Should I turn back?

468
00:32:21,746 --> 00:32:22,785
No.

469
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:24,600
Drop me and go.

470
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,484
Do you know where you've kept it?

471
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,026
Of course.

472
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,371
I can't believe it!

473
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,778
Your Foxy's no less than a proper car!

474
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:45,460
Very funny...

475
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,360
When she's in the mood for it,

476
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,440
My Foxy can make the best of cars bite the dust!

477
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,068
Oh, really!

478
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,613
And when she's not in the mood?

479
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,925
Then?

480
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,812
She just stops...

481
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:16,684
Listen to this one...

482
00:33:16,684 --> 00:33:20,370
Ever since your marriage's been fixed, I swear,

483
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,860
She's been running so well! Never stopped once.

484
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,454
Wow...

485
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:31,717
Would you like some tea, sir?

486
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,480
Of course. Plus something to eat, if you have it.

487
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,926
Alright.

488
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,066
Sit down, mate.

489
00:33:39,863 --> 00:33:43,911
Aunt Suraiyya said 8 p.m.'s the time of departure.

490
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:46,659
As in, we're leaving at 8.

491
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,554
I'm hungry. Let me have something!

492
00:33:49,554 --> 00:33:51,834
Okay...

493
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,806
You really shouldn't be hungry, though...

494
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,356
But, I guess...

495
00:33:59,356 --> 00:34:01,711
As you like it...

496
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,931
Look at me, Gulrez...

497
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,427
Forgive me, mate.

498
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:20,631
Come on, Waqar,

499
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:26,419
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

500
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,488
That's not what it is.

501
00:34:28,488 --> 00:34:29,958
I'm thoroughly delighted.

502
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,475
I'm really enjoying this.

503
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:36,960
Yous twos were sent here to get ready.

504
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,441
And you're sitting here, having a nice little chat!

505
00:34:40,676 --> 00:34:42,666
Why are you here?

506
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:45,211
To keep an eye on the two of you.

507
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:48,168
And because I'd left my bag here.

508
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:54,226
I hope you're not worried.

509
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:56,172
Oh, shoot...

510
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,670
You must be a bit afraid.

511
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,153
You must be a bit afraid.
-Why in the blazes?

512
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:07,025
'My sometime sworn enemy, now my wife' and all...

513
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:10,067
Fair warning, lad...

514
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,306
Something else may be going on...

515
00:35:12,306 --> 00:35:13,941
Shut up!

516
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,116
Hi, Gulrez!

517
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,190
Hi.

518
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,896
Don't you like me?

519
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,071
No --

520
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,075
I like you very much.

521
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:37,708
Marry me, then.

522
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Great...

523
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,590
There's you,

524
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,478
There's you, shameless, only too...

525
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:51,495
And there's this guy...

526
00:35:51,495 --> 00:35:53,961
And there's this guy... So shy...

527
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,756
Alright.

528
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:03,460
You'll go to Maheen's room to get ready,

529
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,112
And you to Fajr's.

530
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:08,660
Alright.

531
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,268
Good.

532
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,018
Okay.

533
00:36:13,346 --> 00:36:15,690
Please don't mind anything I've said.

534
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,875
I was just kidding.

535
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:20,080
Yeah.

536
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,828
I know.

537
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,686
You hardly know anything...

538
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,720
I might as well be very serious!

539
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,400
I'll get my bag.

540
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
