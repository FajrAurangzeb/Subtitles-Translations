1
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,361
You'd dance again today?

2
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,319
On leave today.

3
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:33,420
Tomorrow.

4
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,690
You'd dance at the wedding tomorrow?

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,220
I'd promised Fajr.

6
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,701
Have some shame.

7
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,732
Shame?

8
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,529
About what?

9
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,293
What do you want to prove?

10
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,202
That you don't have the slightest grief?

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,759
C'mon, mate.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,650
I have a lot of grief.

13
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,870
But so what?

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,710
They're happy, and that's all that matters.

15
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:00,490
He's a friend... My elder brother.

16
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,800
And she's my cousin...

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,751
Ex-fiancée.

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,191
Shouldn't I be delighted?

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,140
A friend of mine, a doctor -

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,579
He says, 'If you have to brave some grief',

21
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,960
'Run a race'.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,719
'Exercise'.

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,430
Someone said on the telly yesterday

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,940
That dancing is the best workout.

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,449
Would you look at how intelligent I've become!

26
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,889
I can see that...

27
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:42,250
Tell me,

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,681
What'd you wear tomorrow? The same old suit?

29
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,131
No.

30
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,801
I've bought a new sherwani.

31
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,532
I'll don it and stand right next to the groom.

32
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:55,222
They'll be asking,

33
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:57,282
'Who's the groom'?

34
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,190
<i>Everyone</i> knows

35
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,830
Who the groom is.

36
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,290
I've heard you've met.

37
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,211
Care to tell what happened?

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,790
Just the usual. Chatting around...

39
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,780
Topped with a quarrel.

40
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,090
Another quarrel?

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,290
She doesn't forget the slap from four years ago, Dado...

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,570
She will.

43
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,980
How?

44
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:38,260
Hit her back with one after the marriage.

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,630
She'll forget the old one.

46
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,180
Splendid, Dastoor Ahmed.

47
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,021
You remind me of my mistakes every time you speak.

48
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,971
What mistakes?

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,470
If I'd taken him to the doctor in his younger days, Dastoor wouldn't have been like this...

50
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,960
Just listen quietly...

51
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,421
It's better if you don't speak.

52
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,179
Sure.

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,120
And yes, laddie...

54
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,280
She was talking politely, right?

55
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,761
Yes.

56
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,750
Give her a gift

57
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,950
On the night of the wedding.

58
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,690
What, Dado?

59
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:33,480
Bring your cheek forward and say, 'Slap me right here',

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,071
'But please forget the slap four years ago'.

61
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,120
Were it so easy...!

62
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:43,652
She'd be embarrassed, to say the least.

63
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,570
Alright, leave the slap.

64
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,899
Tell me, did you talk about anything else of <i>a particular sort</i>?

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,880
A <i>particular sort</i>, Dado?

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,151
The romantic sort.

67
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,000
Blimey, Ammi Begum!

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,970
You're speaking English!

69
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,621
I can't help it if he doesn't understand otherwise!

70
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:17,060
Tell me, will you, you twit?

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,721
Nothing much, really.

72
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,491
Did you say 'I love you'?

73
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,220
No?

74
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,580
You muppet!

75
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,361
Why not?

76
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:32,782
Boys say it straight to the face.

77
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:37,184
I was about to say it when Fajr got there.

78
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:38,903
Alright...

79
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,479
The show's finally on the road, eh?

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,540
And yes,

81
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,811
Where's

82
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,132
Your 'friend'?

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,899
'Friend'?

84
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,539
I mean --

85
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,380
Your mate, your Jiya...

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,359
She's turned stone-cold ever since she heard about your marriage. Doesn't even come here.

87
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,110
She doesn't even try

88
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,280
To kidnap you.

89
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,040
Honestly,

90
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,740
Something's fishy, innit?

91
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,999
No. I've talked to her.

92
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,879
She's coming to Maheen's and would stay there until tomorrow.

93
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,251
Save your experienced eyes.

94
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,820
Looking too far will only harm your sight.

95
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm done.

96
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,370
I'll write my diary for the last time tomorrow,

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,720
And I'll end it with

98
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,610
'My Waqar' [=my honour, pride].

99
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,580
I'll leave a margin.

100
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,100
You will write the rest.

101
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,850
I leave every word of my fate for you to write.

102
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,990
Just keep picking words

103
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,521
And penning the story.

104
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:41,571
I used to write,

105
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:43,718
'This happened today'.

106
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,158
You will write

107
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,960
What happens tomorrow.

108
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,691
There, now!

109
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:14,080
Hey!

110
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,515
Let go!

111
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,422
Easy there!

112
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,363
What happened?

113
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,770
Nothing.

114
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,910
I just felt like

115
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,142
Hugging you and crying on your shoulder...

116
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,020
Honestly, why are you crying?

117
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,809
You wouldn't tell anyone, would you?

118
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,910
I won't.

119
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,629
I promise.

120
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,361
I was thinking while writing my diary

121
00:08:55,871 --> 00:08:58,652
That I've picked a fight with him so many times,

122
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,350
Hated him so much for so long...

123
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,389
But for what?

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,939
He'd slapped you!

125
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,490
What's the big deal about that?

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,310
I gave him his deserts proper!

127
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,879
Blimey...

128
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,640
You're softening up for him!

129
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,069
I've only realised now, Jiya,

130
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:41,920
That I love him so much.

131
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,201
I would've died without him.

132
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,530
She had a golden bindiya on when I entered the room.

133
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,992
By my bindiya!

134
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,023
Hold it, Mum!

135
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,033
Eh?

136
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,880
Alright, go on.

137
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,780
Seeing me, she jumped up, saying,

138
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,989
'Have some shame! You can't enter a girl's room without her permission'!

139
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:25,150
I said, 'It's my Dado's room'!

140
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,720
Touché...

141
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,240
Go on.

142
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,180
I took the next step...

143
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,061
The <i>next step</i>?

144
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,392
Let me finish, Dado.

145
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,830
'Slowly edging forward! You're looking like a villain'!

146
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,190
I said, 'Look at yourself, Maheen! Mistaking the hero for the villain'!

147
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,930
She must've said, 'Whatever will become of you, you shameless twit'...

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,940
Aye.

149
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:04,569
That's exactly what she said.

150
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,712
Go on.

151
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,040
When she made a run for it, I grabbed her han --

152
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,990
Gordon Bennet...

153
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,740
That's it.

154
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,261
La fin.

155
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,703
What?

156
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,410
Didn't you let go after you grabbed her hand?

157
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,030
How could I ever, Dado?

158
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,750
I love her so much.

159
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,430
Bless you.

160
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,370
God bless you!

161
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,700
May I go?

162
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,671
Go, my dear.

163
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:01,912
It was a pleasure to hear it!

164
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,129
Thank you.

165
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,720
May I go?

166
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,420
Would you rather sit here with us?

167
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,391
Look at your age!

168
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,311
Very funny!

169
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,890
Hello?

170
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:11,640
Is it Waqar Ahmed?

171
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,972
You've called Waqar; Who else can it be?

172
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,562
May I compliment you?

173
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:18,972
Please.

174
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,190
You're dirty rotten!

175
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,950
A flip like no other in the entire blimming world!

176
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,350
I never thought you could fall so low and flat,

177
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,410
That you'd be so cheap

178
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,061
As to tell everyone about your meeting with your lover like a tale!

179
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,732
You even said you'd grabbed my hand!

180
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,941
God forgive me!

181
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,950
And you told all about it to your Dado, Uncle and Aunt!

182
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,391
Good Lord...

183
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:52,012
I'm marrying <i>that</i> type!

184
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:53,862
Wait and listen, Maheen...

185
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,252
I've heard everything you had to tell.

186
00:13:56,287 --> 00:13:58,682
That was just a joke, Maheen.

187
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,600
Dado was nagging and I gave in.

188
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,470
Tell Jiya, too,

189
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,160
Should she nag you tomorrow!

190
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,371
Then some other friend,

191
00:14:07,371 --> 00:14:08,832
Or neighbour.

192
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,292
What's it to you?

193
00:14:10,342 --> 00:14:12,173
Are you in your senses?

194
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:15,314
I've been knocked for bleedin' six, Waqar Ahmed!

195
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,594
I'm ashamed of myself.

196
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,294
About what?

197
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,770
Fair enough.

198
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,627
Your type doesn't even know what shame is.

199
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,717
It's no big deal, Maheen.

200
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:29,525
Everyone was delighted to hear it, so I thought I did the right thing.

201
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,239
But if it's hurt you, I'm sorry.

202
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,740
What was that?

203
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:37,529
It's difficult...

204
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,390
What's difficult?

205
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,719
I can't figure it out...

206
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,781
I think I've taken the wrong decision.

207
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,100
Stop it, Maheen. I'm saying sorry, ain't I?

208
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,710
You'd better not!

209
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,841
I don't like sorries!

210
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,680
Why are you lying?

211
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,421
You'd said the other day, 'Keep saying sorry to me'

212
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,312
'As long as I live'.

213
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,714
You told them about that, too?

214
00:15:00,714 --> 00:15:03,214
No, Maheen, I didn't tell them <i>everything</i>.

215
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,715
Go ahead and tell them.

216
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,264
It's no big deal.

217
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,265
It's not like anyone's stopping you.

218
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,565
I swear by you it didn't hurt me.

219
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:13,675
Recounting it, I was so happy...

220
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,125
I felt you were with me,

221
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:19,285
And I was telling you that I've just met you...

222
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,510
Why?

223
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,291
Why did you feel so happy?

224
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,671
Because I love you.

225
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,184
I love you very much.

226
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,290
Done?

227
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,940
Done with what?

228
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,931
Is everyone sleeping?

229
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:49,042
Why are you asking that?

230
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,071
Go and tell everyone, will you?

231
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:54,211
Go and tell them, 'I've said "I love you" to Maheen'!

232
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:55,661
No.

233
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,080
I won't tell them anything now.

234
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,660
Why?

235
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,161
Aren't you happy now?

236
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,221
Don't you feel

237
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,652
That I'm sitting before you

238
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,002
And you're saying to me, 'I love you, Maheen'?

239
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,951
You blighter!

240
00:16:10,951 --> 00:16:14,322
You said every bleedin' thing, but saved <i>this</i> for last!

241
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:16,402
I think I'm rather afraid of you.

242
00:16:16,462 --> 00:16:17,692
You'd better.

243
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,552
I can change my mood any moment.

244
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,779
Speaking of which,

245
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,632
Promise me you'll always fear me.

246
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:28,651
I promise.

247
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,390
Saying out of fear, eh?

248
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,401
Yes.

249
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,510
Love me a lot, eh?

250
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,490
That's it, aye.

251
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,341
I don't fear anyone just like that.

252
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,591
Guess what,

253
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,421
Someone's been listening in!

254
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,815
I know Jiya's sitting by your side.

255
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,550
Hey...

256
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,650
Never fear me,

257
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,950
Because I love you very much, too.

258
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,000
No.

259
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,320
The groom would get here in the evening.

260
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,081
He'll get ready

261
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,900
And leave for over there.

262
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,680
I mean, it should at least feel something like a wedding procession!

263
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,929
Don't worry, Jiya, there'll be a grand procession for the wedding. You'll see.

264
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,390
Alright, get here quickly.

265
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,060
What'd Jiya say?

266
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:45,860
She says the groom will get ready here, and the bride at Nano's.

267
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,940
Good idea!

268
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:51,980
I mean, what's with calling the bride and groom from different rooms

269
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,341
To sit on either side of the Reverend?

270
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,831
I won't like it that way.

271
00:18:56,871 --> 00:19:01,142
Yeah, it'd be great. If only Ammi Begum agreed to it.

272
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:02,983
I'll talk to her!

273
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:06,373
Hold on! Finish your breakfast!

274
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,303
Just look at her!

275
00:19:09,303 --> 00:19:11,953
She used to live like a widow when she was getting engaged to Gulrez!

276
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,873
I was the first one to figure out

277
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:16,703
That she loves Waqar.

278
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:19,164
How did you figure out?

279
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,990
Elementary, dear Mummykins,

280
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,691
Could anyone hate such a handsome cousin of hers?

281
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:27,501
She was just putting up an act

282
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,331
Of how much she hates him!

283
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,191
Almost accosting everyone,

284
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:37,331
'Has anyone got the brains to see how much I love him'?

285
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,070
Yes?

286
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,501
The groom would get ready and leave from over here.

287
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:52,931
And

288
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:54,511
The bride?

289
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:57,042
She'd be at her Nano's.

290
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:58,892
As in

291
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,652
He's bringing a procession.

292
00:20:01,652 --> 00:20:02,813
Obviously.

293
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:05,483
There'd be a grand procession at the wedding.

294
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,324
Good idea.

295
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:13,464
The women would be delighted.

296
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:14,936
Innit?

297
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:18,354
I say it from my heart, My Lady!

298
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:20,113
Alright,

299
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:24,044
I'll ask Munshi Alam to decorate my car.

300
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:25,090
No.

301
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,760
Not your car.

302
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,301
Gulrez's.

303
00:20:28,363 --> 00:20:30,024
The...

304
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:31,974
Foxy?

305
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,006
Yes.

306
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:34,736
The Foxy.

307
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,396
There, now!

308
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,610
Haven't his trials ended?

309
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,641
This is no trial, Nano.

310
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,180
It's the dying wish of the departed.

311
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,330
Alright, I get it. We'll talk later.

312
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,410
We're picking the best lehenga for you.

313
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,191
I'm deciding, too.

314
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,801
Love you, Nano.

315
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,911
Bring your ear over here.

316
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,351
Aye?

317
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,820
Love you too!

318
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,501
Crazy lass...

319
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,910
Gulrez's Foxy?

320
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,860
I'd ride <i>that</i>?

321
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,500
Splendid.

322
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,940
It's <i>her</i> wish, laddie.

323
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,820
But why?

324
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,121
Because it's <i>his</i> wish.

325
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:48,871
His last wish.

326
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,281
He, as in,

327
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,690
Gulrez?

328
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,151
Who else could have a last wish these days?

329
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:01,832
He's the poor lad...

330
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:05,752
Alrighty, M. Gulrez...

331
00:22:07,632 --> 00:22:10,523
The wedding procession will be led by your Foxy.

332
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:12,163
Happy?

333
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,070
Wow...

334
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,660
Whoa!

335
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,421
Just as the Lord wished!

336
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:46,392
I've gotten the AC working so well it'll give you the chills!

337
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:48,084
Good Lord!

338
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:51,805
Let me ride it too, Gulrez! Please!

339
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:54,306
We'll go for a ride, sure!

340
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,597
Once we've dropped the bride home.

341
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,386
Sure.

342
00:22:59,617 --> 00:23:00,416
Come.

343
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:01,897
Over here.

344
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,180
Look at this.

345
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,321
These earrings...

346
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,901
He got these made from his first paycheque...

347
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,970
And these bangles when he'd been promoted.

348
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,240
And this pendant...

349
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,710
He'd bought it on the tenth anniversary of his engagement.

350
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,330
And this bindiya...

351
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,260
Know what, Wali...

352
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,941
When she was younger,

353
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:48,551
She'd take the bindiya out of Nano's jewellery box, put it on, and show everyone.

354
00:24:50,581 --> 00:24:53,721
When he's in the mood, Gulrez says,

355
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:57,022
'The bindiya suits her'.

356
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,160
What'd you do with these?

357
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,479
What could I do?

358
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,490
I'd put these on her today.

359
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,890
We'd send her

360
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,820
Decked up as a proper bride.

361
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,890
Here.

362
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,040
He's my brother, too.

363
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,649
And yes,

364
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,050
The lehenga she's wearing today

365
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,800
Is the one I'd bought...

366
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,030
I said,

367
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,330
'A proper bride'

368
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,780
'From our side'...

369
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,690
Just think this marriage is more of a conspiracy.

370
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:31,670
Guess what's gonna happen to her right after the marriage!
-What?

371
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,650
She won't be the Chief of the gang anymore.

372
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,951
Because a married girl cannot be the Chief.

373
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,061
Yes!

374
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,170
There!

375
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,980
Now you get it!

376
00:26:41,109 --> 00:26:44,840
And the new Chief will be...

377
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,510
Gulrez!

378
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,090
What's going on, folks?

379
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,660
C'mon, m'boy.

380
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,559
Get your things and put them in Gulrez's Foxy.

381
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,840
And get go -- It's 6!

382
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,471
6 already?

383
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,191
Alright, who's coming with me?

384
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,470
Just

385
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,960
Just me.

386
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,850
Alright, Dado...

387
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,580
I'll call my friends here.

388
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:16,690
Just a minute.
-I give you five minutes.

389
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:19,608
I want to see you after that.

390
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,900
There, now!

391
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:27,680
The Reverend's here already.

392
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,420
Good evening.
-Good evening, Reverend. Please, come in.

393
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,501
Good evening, Reverend.

394
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,090
Hurry up, Jiya, he's started already!

395
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,170
Hey!

396
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,091
Why the hurry?

397
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,430
How 'bout a meeting before the wedding?

398
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,210
Put a sock in it!

399
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,290
He ain't catching a glimpse of me before the wedding.

400
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,421
No way!

401
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,250
Double time!

402
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,102
Hold on.

403
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,042
Let me get ready...

404
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:02,542
I want to see

405
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:06,153
How he looks at anyone else with you there!

406
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,793
Envying me, eh?

407
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,340
A lot. I swear.

408
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,880
Do you know how?

409
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,560
How?

410
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,100
The way one looks at losers.

411
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,070
C'mon, now!

412
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,680
Coming.

413
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,611
Sit down.

414
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,480
How's it going?

415
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,200
Honestly!

416
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,051
I swear by you,

417
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,852
I'm delighted

418
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:27,382
To see two lovers meet.

419
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:30,182
So delighted I can't believe it.

420
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,979
Forgive her.

421
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,629
Are you nuts?

422
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,571
Forgive her for what?

423
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,971
Didn't I say,

424
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,840
I'm very delighted?

425
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:44,751
And what about <i>your</i> love?

426
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,813
Would it ever let you be delighted?

427
00:29:49,672 --> 00:29:51,862
Let me tell you something...

428
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,770
One never demands something in love.

429
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,731
One commands.

430
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,321
To love back is a favour,

431
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,791
Nor an obligation.

432
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:06,742
C'mon, now, my dear.

433
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,713
Cheer up.

434
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,501
Gulrez...

435
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,421
Maheen's texted me...

436
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:24,593
She's asked me to request you

437
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:27,259
To hold her hand

438
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,261
And bring her to the Reverend

439
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,390
When she's ready,

440
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,709
And whisper to her,

441
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,220
'I forgive you, Maheen'.

442
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,091
It's <i>her</i> wish.

443
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,520
Or, she wrote,

444
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:45,210
She'd apologise to you before everyone.

445
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:59,110
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

446
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:13,660
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

447
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,450
C'mon, mate, talk about something, or just put some music on.

448
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:27,090
I'm very worried, Jiya.

449
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm afraid I might just die if I, as the bride, saw him.

450
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,811
Are you out of your mind?

451
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,341
As if seeing your groom could kill you!

452
00:31:37,391 --> 00:31:38,791
Not the groom!

453
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,462
Gulrez...

454
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,290
Alright, then,

455
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:44,630
I'll ask Gulrez to stay away

456
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,880
Until after your marriage.

457
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,230
No way, mate.

458
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,300
I've asked him to hold my hand

459
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,040
And bring me downstairs when I'm ready.

460
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:55,030
Brilliant...

461
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,751
'Toro, c'mon'!

462
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,910
Sorta.

463
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:04,861
Because if I've wronged him, I want that I die the moment I see him.

464
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:08,181
Jeez, mate!

465
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:10,492
What is it?

466
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,142
Your hurries made a mess!

467
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:15,682
I've left my bag back there!

468
00:32:16,063 --> 00:32:17,593
Jeez...

469
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:21,612
Should I turn back?

470
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:22,622
No.

471
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:24,313
Drop me and go.

472
00:32:24,362 --> 00:32:26,123
Do you know where you've kept it?

473
00:32:26,183 --> 00:32:27,932
Of course.

474
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,921
I can't believe it!

475
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:43,601
Your Foxy's no less than a proper car!

476
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,541
Very funny...

477
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,180
When she's in the mood for it,

478
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,340
My Foxy can make the best of cars bite the dust!

479
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,850
Oh, really!

480
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,411
And when she's not in the mood?

481
00:33:10,461 --> 00:33:11,661
Then?

482
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,481
She just stops...

483
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:16,263
Listen to this one...

484
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:20,194
Ever since your marriage's been fixed, I swear,

485
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:23,534
She's been running so well! Never stopped once.

486
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:25,044
Wow...

487
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,280
Would you like some tea, sir?

488
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Of course. Plus something to eat, if you have it.

489
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,741
Alright.

490
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,870
Sit down, mate.

491
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,439
Aunt Suraiyya said 8 p.m.'s the time of departure.

492
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:46,440
As in, we're leaving at 8.

493
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,220
I'm starving. Let me have something!

494
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,770
Okay...

495
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,991
You really shouldn't be hungry, though...

496
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,911
But, I guess...

497
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:01,041
As you like it...

498
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,730
Look at me, Gulrez...

499
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,950
Forgive me, mate.

500
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,120
Come on, Waqar,

501
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,649
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

502
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,050
That's not what it is.

503
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,750
I'm thoroughly delighted.

504
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,050
I'm really enjoying this.

505
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,780
Yous twos were sent here to get ready.

506
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,860
And you're sitting here, having a nice little chat!

507
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,100
Why are you here?

508
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,041
To keep an eye on the two of you.

509
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,872
And yeah, I left my bag here too.

510
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,920
I hope you're not worried.

511
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,851
Oh, shoot...

512
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,522
You must be a bit afraid.

513
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:00,604
You must be a bit afraid.
-Why in the blazes?

514
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:06,224
'My sometime sworn enemy, now my wife' and all...

515
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,810
Fair warning, lad...

516
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:12,164
Something else may be going on...

517
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:13,632
Shut up!

518
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,855
Hi, Gulrez!

519
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,920
Hi.

520
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,570
Don't you like me?

521
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,920
No --

522
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,430
I like you very much.

523
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,311
Marry me, then?

524
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,080
Lovely...

525
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,022
There's you,

526
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,742
Shameless, only too...

527
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,373
And there's this guy...

528
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:53,896
And there's this guy... So shy...

529
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,482
Alright.

530
00:35:57,641 --> 00:36:01,801
You'll go to Maheen's room to get ready,

531
00:36:03,191 --> 00:36:05,761
And you to Fajr's.

532
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:08,530
Alright.

533
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,891
Good.

534
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:12,781
Okay.

535
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,532
Please don't mind anything I've said.

536
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:17,243
I was just kidding.

537
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:19,744
Yeah.

538
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,463
I know.

539
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:25,434
You hardly know anything...

540
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,285
I might as well be very serious!

541
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,910
I'll get my bag.

542
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
