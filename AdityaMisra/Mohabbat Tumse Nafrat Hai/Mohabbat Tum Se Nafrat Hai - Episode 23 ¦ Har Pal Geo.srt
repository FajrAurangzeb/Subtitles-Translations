1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd dance again today?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On leave today.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tomorrow.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd dance at the wedding tomorrow?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd promised Fajr.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shame?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About what?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want to prove?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you don't have the slightest grief?

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have a lot of grief.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But so what?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're happy, and that's all that matters.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a friend... My elder brother.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's my cousin...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ex-fiancée.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shouldn't I be delighted?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A friend of mine, a doctor -

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He says, 'If you have to brave some grief',

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Run a race'.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Exercise'.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone said on TV yesterday

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That dancing is the best workout.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at how intelligent I've become!

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see that...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me,

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you wear tomorrow? The same old suit?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've bought a new sherwani.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll don it and stand right next to the groom.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'll be asking,

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Who's the groom'?

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Everyone knows</i>

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who the groom is.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard you've met.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell what happened?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just the usual. Chatting around...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Topped with a quarrel.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Another quarrel?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't forget the slap from four years ago, Dado...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hit her back with one after the marriage.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll forget the old one.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid, Dastoor Ahmed.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You remind me of my mistakes every time you speak.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What mistakes?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I'd taken him to the doctor in his younger days, Dastoor wouldn't have been like this...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just listen quietly...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's better if you don't speak.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes, laddie...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was talking politely, right?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give her a gift

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the night of the wedding.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What, Dado?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring your cheek forward and say, 'Slap me right here',

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'But please forget the slap four years ago'.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she'd forget!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be embarrassed, to say the least.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, leave the slap.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Tell me, did you talk about anything else of a particular sort?</i>

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Of a particular sort, Dado?</i>

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The romantic sort.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Ammi Begum!

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're speaking English!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't help it if he doesn't understand otherwise!

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, will you, you twit?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much, really.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you say 'I love you'?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You muppet!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Boys say it straight to the face.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was about to say it when Fajr got there.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The show's finally on the road, eh?

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes,

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your 'friend'?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Friend'?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mate, your Jiya...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's turned stone-cold ever since she heard about your marriage. Doesn't even come here.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't even try

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To kidnap you.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly,

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something's fishy, innit?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. I've talked to her.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's coming to Maheen's and would stay there until tomorrow.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Save your experienced eyes.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking too far will only harm your sight.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm done.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll write my diary for the last time tomorrow,

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll end it with

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'My Waqar' [=my honour, pride].

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll leave a margin.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will write the rest.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I leave every word of my fate for you to write.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just keep picking words

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And penning the story.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to write,

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'This happened today'.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You will write

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happens tomorrow.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let go!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easy there!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just felt like

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hugging you and crying on your shoulder...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly, why are you crying?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wouldn't tell anyone, would you?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was thinking while writing my diary

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I've picked a fight with him so many times,

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hated him so much for so long...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But for what?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd slapped you!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the big deal about that?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I gave him his deserts proper!

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're softening up for him!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've only realised now, Jiya,

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I love him so much.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would've died without him.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had a golden bindiya on when I entered the room.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By my bindiya!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold it, Mum!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eh?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, go on.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seeing me, she jumped up, saying,

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Have some shame! You can't enter a girl's room without her permission'!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'It's my Dado's room'!

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Touché...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I took the next step...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The next step?</i>

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me finish, Dado.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Slowly edging forward! You're looking like a villain'!

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'Look at yourself, Maheen! Mistaking the hero for the villain'!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She must've said, 'Whatever will become of you, you shameless twit'...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's exactly what she said.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when she started running, I grabbed her han --

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gordon Bennet...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
La fin.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you let go after you grabbed her hand?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I ever, Dado?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love her so much.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God bless you!

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I go?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, my dear.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was a pleasure to hear it!

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I go?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you rather sit here with us?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at your age!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it Waqar Ahmed?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've called Waqar; Who else can it be?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I compliment you?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're dirty rotten!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A flip like no other in the entire blimming world!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought you could fall so low and flat,

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd be so cheap

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As to tell everyone about your meeting with your lover like a tale!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You even said you'd grabbed my hand!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God forgive me!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you told all about it to your Dado, Uncle and Aunt!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'm marrying that type!</i>

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait and listen, Maheen...

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard everything you had to tell.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was just a joke, Maheen.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado was nagging and I gave in.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Jiya, too,

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should she nag you tomorrow!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then some other friend,

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or neighbour.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to you?

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you in your senses?

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been knocked for bleedin' six, Waqar Ahmed!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm ashamed of myself.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About what?

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your type doesn't even know what shame is.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no big deal, Maheen.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone was delighted to hear it, so I thought I did the right thing.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if it's hurt you, I'm sorry.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's difficult...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's difficult?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't figure it out...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I've taken the wrong decision.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Maheen. I'm saying sorry, ain't I?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better not!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like sorries!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you lying?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd said the other day, 'Keep saying sorry to me'

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'As long as I live'.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told them about that, too?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>No, Maheen, I didn't tell everything.</i>

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go ahead and tell them.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no big deal.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not like anyone's stopping you.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you it didn't hurt me.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Recounting it, I was so happy...

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt you were with me,

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I was telling you that I've just met you...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you feel so happy?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I love you.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you very much.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done?

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done with what?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is everyone sleeping?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you asking that?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell everyone, will you?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and tell them, 'I've said "I love you" to Maheen'!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't tell them anything now.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you happy now?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you feel

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'm sitting before you

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're saying to me, 'I love you, Maheen'?

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You blighter!

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You said every bleedin' thing, but saved this for last!</i>

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'm rather afraid of you.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd better.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can change my mood any moment.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And promise me

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'll always fear me.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saying out of fear, eh?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love me a lot, eh?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it, aye.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't fear anyone just like that.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what,

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's been listening in!

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know Jiya's sitting by your side.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never fear me,

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I love you very much, too.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The groom would get here in the evening.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll get ready

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leave for over there.

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, it should at least feel something like a wedding procession!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, Jiya, there'll be a grand procession for the wedding. You'll see.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, get here quickly.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd Jiya say?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says the groom will get ready here, and the bride at Nano's.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good idea!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, what's with calling the bride and groom from different rooms

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To sit on either side of the priest?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't like it that way.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, it'd be great. If only Ammi Begum agreed to it.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to her!

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on! Finish your breakfast!

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just look at her!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She used to live like a widow when she was getting engaged to Gulrez!

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was the first one to figure out

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she loves Waqar.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How did you figure out?

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Mummykins,

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could anyone hate such a handsome cousin of hers?

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was just putting up an act

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of how much she hates him!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost accosting everyone,

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Has anyone got the brains to see how much I love him'?

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The groom would get ready and leave from over here.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bride?

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be at her Nano's.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's bringing a procession.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There'd be a grand procession at the wedding.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good idea.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The women would be delighted.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say it from my heart, My Lady!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask Munshi Alam to decorate my car.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not your car.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The...

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Foxy?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Foxy.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't his trials ended?

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is no trial, Nano.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the dying wish of the departed.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I get it. We'll talk later.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're picking the best lehenga for you.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm deciding, too.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love you, Nano.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bring your ear over here.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love you too!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crazy lass...

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's Foxy?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I'd ride that?</i>

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It's her wish, laddie.</i>

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Because it's his wish.</i>

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His last wish.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He, as in,

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who else could have a last wish these days?

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's the poor lad...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alrighty, M. Gulrez...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wedding procession will be led by your Foxy.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As the Lord wished! [praise]

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've gotten the AC working so well it'll give you the chills!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me ride it too, Gulrez! Please!

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll go for a ride, sure!

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once we've dropped the bride home.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over here.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at this.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These earrings...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd gotten these made from his first paycheque...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And these bangles when he'd been promoted.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this pendant...

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd bought it on the tenth anniversary of his engagement.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this bindiya...

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Wali...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she was younger,

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd take the bindiya out of Nano's jewellery box, put it on, and show everyone.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When he's in the mood, Gulrez says,

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The bindiya suits her'.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do with these?

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I do?

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd put these on her today.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd send her

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Decked up as a proper bride.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my brother, too.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And yes,

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lehenga she's wearing today

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the one I'd bought...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said,

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'A proper bride'

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'From our side'...

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think this marriage is more of a conspiracy.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what's gonna happen to her right after the marriage!
-What?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't be the Chief of the gang anymore.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because a married girl cannot be the Chief.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you get it!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the new Chief will be...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's going on, folks?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, my dear.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get your things and put them in Gulrez's Foxy.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And get go -- It's 6!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
6 already?

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, who's coming with me?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just me.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Dado...

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call my friends here.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute.
-I give you five minutes.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to see you after that.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Reverend's here already.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening.
-Good evening, Reverend. Please, come in.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening, Reverend.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurry up, Jiya, he's started already!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why the hurry?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout a meeting before the wedding?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ain't catching a glimpse of me before the wedding.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold on.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me get ready...

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to see

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How he looks at anyone else with you there!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Envying me, eh?

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A lot. I swear.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know how?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way one looks at losers.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Coming.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's it going?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly!

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you,

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm delighted

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To see two lovers meet.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So delighted I can't believe it.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive her.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you nuts?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive her for what?

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I say,

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very delighted?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And what about your love?</i>

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would it ever let you be delighted?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me tell you something...

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One never demands something in love.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One commands.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To love back is a favour,

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor an obligation.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now, my dear.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be happy.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's texted me...

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's asked me to request you

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To hold her hand

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And bring her to the Reverend

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she's ready,

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And whisper to her,

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I forgive you, Maheen'.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It's her wish.</i>

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or else, she wrote,

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd apologise to you before everyone.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mate, talk about something, or just put some music on.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very worried, Jiya.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid I might just die if I, as the bride, saw him.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you out of your mind?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if seeing your groom could kill you!

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not the groom!

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez...

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, then,

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask Gulrez to stay away

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until after your marriage.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, mate.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked him to hold my hand

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And bring me downstairs when I'm ready.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brilliant...

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Toro, c'mon'!

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because if I've wronged him, I want that I die to see him.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez, mate!

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your hurries made a mess!

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've left my bag back there!

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez...

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I turn back?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drop me and go.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know where you've kept it?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe it!

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Foxy's no less than a proper car!

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very funny...

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she's in the mood for it,

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Foxy can make the best of cars bite the dust!

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, really!

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when she's not in the mood?

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just stops...

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen to this one...

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever since your marriage's been fixed, I swear,

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been running so well! Never stopped once.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like some tea, sir?

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course. Plus something to eat, if you have it.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down, mate.

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Suraiyya said 8 p.m.'s the time of departure.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, we're leaving at 8.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm hungry. Let me have something!

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You really shouldn't be hungry, though...

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, I guess...

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you like it...

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at me, Gulrez...

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, mate.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, Waqar,

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you keep on embarrassing me like that, I'd feel as if I'm feigning my delight.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not what it is.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm thoroughly delighted.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm really enjoying this.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yous twos were sent here to get ready.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you're sitting here, having a nice little chat!

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here?

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To keep an eye on the two of you.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And because I'd left my bag here.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you're not worried.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, shoot...

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be a bit afraid.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You must be a bit afraid.
-Why in the blazes?

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'My sometime sworn enemy, now my wife' and all...

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair warning, lad...

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something else may be going on...

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, Gulrez!

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi.

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you like me?

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No --

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I like you very much.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marry me, then.

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great...

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's you,

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's you, shameless, only too...

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there's this guy...

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And there's this guy... So shy...

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll go to Maheen's room to get ready,

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you to Fajr's.

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please don't mind anything I've said.

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was just kidding.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You hardly know anything...

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might as well be very serious!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get my bag.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
