1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Done, done, done!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd say you

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Head for Dado's; we'll get ready and come.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I go?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not? Go.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Up there

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the writing table

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Maheen's diary.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please,

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't read it.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what it may conceal!

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, mate.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't read others' diaries.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well,

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May nobody read the diary of one

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's accused of loving someone else.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't even touch

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your enemy's diary!

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, friendship with her will be impossible.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright,

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have to dash!

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a love marriage,

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does it look like?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 100% a love marriage.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone must've told you.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody told me.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How do you know, then?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's etched

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the girl's face.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask her to close her eyes,

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She opens them repeatedly.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't quite believe it, I think,

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she tries to see it again

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To believe it.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even if you tell her a good joke,

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She says, 'Hmm... What was that'?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she's chuffed to have someone

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd get her decked up quickly!

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she starts laughing

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like you are every now and then.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're almost ready.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In just a moment, now, you...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here, Nano.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bride's jewellery.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here, let me kiss your forehead.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May you live long.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the writing table

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Maheen's diary.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please,

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't read it.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what it may conceal!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May nobody read the diary of one

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's accused of loving someone else.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't even touch

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your enemy's diary!

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it that Gulrez loves me,

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or that he worships me?

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I start to question myself

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I'd ever be able to take such love.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Gulrez,

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep on loving me.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In time, I'll learn to take it.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam told me today

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you'd purchased a bindiya [ornament] for me.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I smiled coyly to myself for long.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you made of, Gulrez,

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remembering every single detail like you do?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That muppet, that Londoner tramp,

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's landed in Karachi.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at him, I'm reminded of his slap.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There is but one thing my heart longs for,

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that is the day when I'd get even with him.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you smiling?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These looks could kill

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anybody unfortunate enough to meet your gaze!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look so sweet!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My gaze would only meet his today.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be like an offering unto him.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, Ammi Begum?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Reverend is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call the nincompoop,

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask him to come here with the procession.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen,
-Yes?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say what I've told you, and not a word beyond it. Go, now.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Ammi Begum.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at this wee lassie!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The filly's showing up now!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go!

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you quiet?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're quiet.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know why, Ali,

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart grows restless.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart grows restless too.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you like some water?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get some.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just as the Lord has willed!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tarry too much.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if I have to deck up like a bride, mate!

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me 15 minutes,

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll be ready.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's see...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make it quick.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll take a while, Uncle,

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's dressing up like the groom.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll make haste only if you ask him to,

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Reverend over here is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir,

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the loo?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This way.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's there this way, Uncle?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not saying it to you, mate!

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go, Reverend, the loo's this way.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This phone is switched off.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar, please answer me.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your phone's switched off too!

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar, everyone's waiting over there!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dear Maheen,

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It has been a pleasure

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That this chapter of our love began,

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we fell in love;

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such love that you agreed to marry me.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does one wager oneself in one's quest for revenge?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I could've taken two slaps from you had you just said it;

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you have to play this elaborate game just to avenge one slap?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any idea how many people here love you?

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There are many besides Gulrez who adore you with all their lives.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take Ammi Begum, for instance,

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd kick her sense of justice away when it'd come to you.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Suraiyya,

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother,

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you have any idea how many woes she's gone through?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your sister Fajr,

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always kept guessing you'd fallen for me!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You silly girl,

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least you could've thought of Gulrez, if none of them.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He kept writhing in love like an animal to be sacrificed,

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And kept on doing what you wanted him to.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly,

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he in on this one?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't seem the type, though.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's very simple.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He endures sorrow,

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never gives one any.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought for long before I threw away the sherwani about what it was --

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were you up to?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At first, it occurred to me

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I should let the vaudeville commence,

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then thought

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if, amidst this vaudeville, we got espoused, your face would be smirched by my name.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez has done me so many favours

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I find it improper that he should get to wear what I shall take off.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be coming back.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And listen,

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One has to yield.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I depart a victor,

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I say this as I leave,

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bless you'

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'With this closing checkmate'.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After eight long years, I'm hearing

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rathe shuffling of your footsteps...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like this, you used to come eagerly, hying --

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if you'd trample everyone under your feet...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Inheritance --

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If word got out

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he may get a share --

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps he'll pay a visit...

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here, Nano.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only I get the news.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whenever he comes here,

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The cacti in Nano's lawn blossom.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh God!

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd left,

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Left here a barren,

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Desolate world.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woeful faces,

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Startled eyes,

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hearts beating and stopping;

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was feared

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Ammi Begum

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May not be able to take this sorrow,

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her little games of cricket served her well.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd known

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the player can get bowled

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On a ball he could've easily scored a four on.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, your wound's alright now.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You think it's alright.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel like an old wound's been opened again.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam,

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I ask you something?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did Neelam throw a pebble at me?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Apparently, she couldn't find anything better.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Saw you outside the graveyard, didn't she?

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could she find there besides a pebble?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What should I prepare for dinner?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing. I'm not hungry.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not right now.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Soon, you will be.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What, now, does the stomach know about serious wounds?

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't have anything for two days, too.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know how long

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The others starved themselves.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They started eating again, soon.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like they always used to.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They used to laugh,

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a right merrymaking...

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And play cricket, too?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nobody there plays cricket now.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So did the pebble strike him,

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or did you just pick one up and fling it towards him?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hit him right on his forehead, Ammi Begum.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blood gushed out like a fountain before my eyes.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, Nano...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a good laugh, you wee lassie!

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's about time the rapscallion's reckoning began.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It delights me to hear

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the reprobate is getting sentenced,

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the sentence is being carried out in the present instant itself!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't he say anything in return?

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just kept staring at me, wide-eyed.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The esurient lad!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at how he came here, running, the moment I signed the will;

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise,

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd been in hiding for eight long years.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've given him half the property from Suraiyya and Fatima's share

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of the bequeathal.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought Mashood Ahmed may ask me when I go up there,

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now,

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't send photocopies up there, otherwise, I'd shove one in his face, saying,

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'The piece of land that goes to your son'

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Is one where cacti blossom, Mashood Ahmed'!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he brought his wife and children along?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was alone there, Nano.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He must be staying at one of those hotels...

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Dastoor to send him the will,

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say, 'It'll take time for Kaneez Begum to die'.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everything shall be divided after my death.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His accursed self will be before my Maheen's eyes.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give him his share of the money and kick him on the back, saying,

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Begone'!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Go back to where you came from'!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In your place, I'd blooter him!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I wouldn't be there...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened that night?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, what happened that night?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The night of the wedding.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I'd left.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love</i>

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see that?

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even as Judgement Day approaches,

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The expressions of companionship don't change.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Expression'

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is an English word, Ammi Begum.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, Dastoor Ahmed.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look over there.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She cares for the birds even to this day.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit has no idea

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd fly away the moment they get the opportunity to.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was saying,

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Ammi Begum's fine now'.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'll be leaving shortly'.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to me?

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll fall ill again!

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had my reason for leaving her, Munshi Alam.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I have evidence for everything.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have but regret.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfidy has no reason, and

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Regret has no evidence.

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm dying, Munshi Alam.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just feel you're dying.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those who die.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They quieten,

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are petrified,

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And forget even to blink.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Today,

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shall get a certified copy of the will.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May leave before nightfall,

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise,

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One of these days, I may say to you in person that I

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find your very existence

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Miasmic.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to me, Munshi Alam.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, talk to me.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what happened that night.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're under Dado's oath.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a bit more.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm leaving, Nano...

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Start running faster.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once you've learnt to speak loudly,

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For once,

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And show me.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would like to

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Capture that moment in my eyes.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not an order, Chief,

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just my wish.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Uncle.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back, Ammi Begum.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whatever is it

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I should bless you with, my dear?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He kept looking for a trace

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of where you were.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The clock struck 10.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There were so many calls from Kaneez Mahal,

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Answered one with uncertainty,

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And didn't answer a handful.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when Dr Imran told him

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he's left,

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He made a run for it.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everybody over at Kaneez Mahal had their suspicions,

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone played their part in the pasquinade.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at each other,

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd smile for no reason.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone was distressed,

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And nobody knew what was going to happen.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Came that moment.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He barged into Kaneez Mahal suddenly, panting,

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But everybody's eyes searched for you by his side.

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Were nowhere.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Left.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's that bleedin' bridegroom?

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is he?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Maheen?

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C -- Come with me.

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His phone's switched off.

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let it remain switched off, mate.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be here.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's left.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And left a letter addressed to you.

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me the letter.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dear Maheen,

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It has been a pleasure

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That this chapter of our love began,

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we fell in love;

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such love that you agreed to marry me.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does one wager oneself in one's quest for revenge?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your sister Fajr,

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She always kept guessing you'd fallen for me!

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You silly girl,

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At least you could've thought of Gulrez, if none of them.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He kept writhing in love like an animal to be sacrificed,

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And kept on doing what you wanted him to.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One has to yield.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I depart a victor,

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I say this as I leave,

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bless you'

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'With this closing checkmate'.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
