1
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:02,991
Done, done, done!

2
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:04,492
I'd say you

3
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:07,023
Head for Dado's; we'll get ready and come.

4
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:07,631
Okay.

5
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,811
See you.

6
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,021
Bye.

7
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:12,621
May I go?

8
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:14,103
Why not? Go.

9
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:16,151
Listen!

10
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:16,946
Up there

11
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,217
On the writing table

12
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:20,542
Is Maheen's diary.

13
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:21,400
I think

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,663
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

15
00:01:24,663 --> 00:01:25,680
Please,

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,465
Don't read it.

17
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,774
Who knows what it may conceal!

18
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:31,841
Come on, mate.

19
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,117
I don't read others' diaries.

20
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:35,310
Well,

21
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,351
May nobody read the diary of one

22
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:41,992
Who's accused of loving someone else.

23
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,540
And don't even touch

24
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,794
Your enemy's diary!

25
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:52,830
Otherwise, friendship with her will be impossible.

26
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,673
Alright,

27
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:54,829
Bye.

28
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,954
Bye.

29
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,630
Have to dash!

30
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:07,262
It's a love marriage,

31
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:09,511
Innit?

32
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,902
What does it look like?

33
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:14,809
It's 100% a love marriage.

34
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,216
Someone must've told you.

35
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,153
No?

36
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,230
Not at all.

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,811
Nobody told me.

38
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:24,884
How do you know, then?

39
00:02:24,884 --> 00:02:26,341
It's etched

40
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,480
On the girl's face.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,965
If you ask her to close her eyes,

42
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:34,565
She opens them repeatedly.

43
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,028
Why?

44
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,371
She doesn't quite believe it, I think,

45
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,924
And she tries to see it again

46
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:43,527
To believe it.

47
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:45,282
Even if you tell her a good joke,

48
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,734
She says, 'Hmm... What was that'?

49
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,413
And she's chuffed to have someone

50
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:53,083
Who'd get her decked up quickly!

51
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,933
And she starts laughing

52
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:58,433
Like you are every now and then.

53
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:04,640
You're almost ready.

54
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,969
In just a moment, now, you...

55
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,977
Here, Nano.

56
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:22,421
The bride's jewellery.

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,060
Come here, let me kiss your forehead.

58
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,811
May you live long.

59
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:03,670
On the writing table

60
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,981
Is Maheen's diary.

61
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,853
I think

62
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:10,166
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

63
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,098
Please,

64
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:13,105
Don't read it.

65
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:16,138
Who knows what it may conceal!

66
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:17,311
Well,

67
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:19,418
May nobody read the diary of one

68
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:26,232
Who's accused of loving someone else.

69
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,708
And don't even touch

70
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:32,912
Your enemy's diary!

71
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,566
Is it that Gulrez loves me,

72
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:06,916
Or that he worships me?

73
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,476
I start to question myself

74
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,386
If I'd ever be able to take such love.

75
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,996
Please, Gulrez,

76
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:17,315
Keep on loving me.

77
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:22,159
In time, I'll learn to take it.

78
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:24,735
Neelam told me today

79
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:27,735
That you'd purchased a bindiya [ornament] for me.

80
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:31,196
I smiled coyly to myself for long.

81
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,909
What are you made of, Gulrez,

82
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:37,079
Remembering every single detail like you do?

83
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,282
That muppet, that Londoner tramp,

84
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,143
He's landed in Karachi.

85
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:46,813
Looking at him, I'm reminded of his slap.

86
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,457
There is but one thing my heart longs for,

87
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:54,423
And that is the day when I'd get even with him.

88
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:19,155
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

89
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:28,461
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

90
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:39,930
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

91
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,514
Why are you smiling?

92
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:17,591
These looks could kill

93
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:20,757
Anybody unfortunate enough to meet your gaze!

94
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:24,770
You look so sweet!

95
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,717
My gaze would only meet his today.

96
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:31,686
It'll be like an offering unto him.

97
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:55,298
Dastoor!

98
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,366
Come here.

99
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,668
Yes, Ammi Begum?

100
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:10,558
Molvi Sahab is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

101
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,208
Call the nincompoop,

102
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,651
Ask him to come here with the procession.

103
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:15,401
Alright.

104
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,933
Listen,
-Yes?

105
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:21,061
Just say what I've told you, and not a word beyond it. Go, now.

106
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,433
Alright, Ammi Begum.

107
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,234
There, now!

108
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:28,129
Would you look at this wee lassie!

109
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,188
The filly's showing up now!

110
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,157
Go!

111
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,351
Why are you quiet?

112
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:42,540
You're quiet.

113
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,320
That's why.

114
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,162
I don't know why, Ali,

115
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:48,975
But my heart grows restless.

116
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,463
Doesn't it?

117
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,325
What do you mean?

118
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:55,694
My heart grows restless too.

119
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:57,648
Would you like some water?

120
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,883
Yes.

121
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:02,681
I'll get some.

122
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,842
Splendid!

123
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:32,645
Just as the Lord has willed!

124
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:35,458
Come on.

125
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,038
Don't tarry too much.

126
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:41,089
As if I have to deck up like a bride, mate!

127
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,301
Just give me 15 minutes,

128
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:45,131
And I'll be ready.

129
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:46,636
Let's see...

130
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,673
Make it quick.

131
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,454
It'll take a while, Uncle,

132
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:01,032
He's dressing up like the groom.

133
00:10:01,032 --> 00:10:03,746
He'll make haste only if you ask him to,

134
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:08,182
Molvi Sahab over here is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

135
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:08,777
Sir,

136
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:10,153
Where's the loo?

137
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,948
This way.

138
00:10:13,098 --> 00:10:14,826
What's there this way, Uncle?

139
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:17,375
I'm not saying it to you, mate!

140
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,671
Go, Molvi Sahab, the loo's this way.

141
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:32,170
Waqar!

142
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:35,360
This phone is switched off.

143
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,497
Waqar, please answer me.

144
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:48,205
Your phone's switched off too!

145
00:11:48,205 --> 00:11:52,205
Waqar, everyone's waiting over there!

146
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,157
Waqar!

147
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,510
Waqar!

148
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,850
Waqar!

149
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,350
Waqar?

150
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,876
Dear Maheen,

151
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:48,453
It has been a pleasure

152
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,241
That this chapter of our love began,

153
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:53,374
And we fell in love;

154
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:56,501
Such love that you agreed to marry me.

155
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,922
Splendid.

156
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:04,015
Does one wager oneself in one's quest for revenge?

157
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:07,247
I could've taken two slaps from you had you just said it;

158
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:11,851
Why did you have to play this elaborate game just to avenge one slap?

159
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:16,068
Do you have any idea how many people here love you?

160
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:20,847
There are many besides Gulrez who adore you with all their lives.

161
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:23,399
Take Ammi Begum, for instance,

162
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,039
She'd kick her sense of justice away when it'd come to you.

163
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,612
Aunt Suraiyya,

164
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,112
Your mother,

165
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:33,720
Do you have any idea how many woes she's gone through?

166
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,725
And your sister Fajr,

167
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:41,361
She always kept guessing you'd fallen for me!

168
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,267
You silly girl,

169
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:48,524
At least you could've thought of Gulrez, if none of them.

170
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,034
He kept writhing in love like an animal to be sacrificed,

171
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:55,160
And kept on doing what you wanted him to.

172
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,681
Honestly,

173
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:58,907
Is he in on this one?

174
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:01,819
He doesn't seem the type, though.

175
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,938
He's very simple.

176
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:06,116
He endures sorrow,

177
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:07,690
But never gives one any.

178
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,329
I thought for long before I threw away the sherwani about what it was --

179
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,878
What were you up to?

180
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,470
At first, it occurred to me

181
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,112
That I should let the vaudeville commence,

182
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:20,365
But then thought

183
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:26,332
That if, amidst this vaudeville, we got espoused, your face would be smirched by my name.

184
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,862
Gulrez has done me so many favours

185
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:33,582
That I find it improper that he should get to wear what I shall take off.

186
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,350
I'm leaving.

187
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,257
I won't be coming back.

188
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,000
And listen,

189
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,522
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

190
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:47,133
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

191
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:51,350
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

192
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,126
One has to yield.

193
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,717
I depart a victor,

194
00:14:56,717 --> 00:14:58,803
And I say this as I leave,

195
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,836
'Bless you'

196
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:04,846
'With this closing checkmate'.

197
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:32,502
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

198
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,121
After eight long years, I'm hearing

199
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:43,084
The rathe shuffling of your footsteps...

200
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:57,971
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

201
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:11,676
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

202
00:15:54,198 --> 00:16:00,306
Just like this, you used to come eagerly, hying --

203
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:10,139
As if you'd trample everyone under your feet...

204
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:21,138
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

205
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:30,355
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

206
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:39,940
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

207
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:49,339
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

208
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:58,777
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

209
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:10,968
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

210
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:17,827
Inheritance --

211
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:20,101
If word got out

212
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:23,598
That he may get a share --

213
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:27,172
Perhaps he'll pay a visit...

214
00:16:35,184 --> 00:16:37,121
Neelam...

215
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:47,446
He's here, Nano.

216
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,175
Only I get the news.

217
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:55,306
Whenever he comes here,

218
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,023
The cacti in Nano's lawn blossom.

219
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:00,570
Oh God!

220
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,771
You'd left,

221
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:22,865
But

222
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,476
Left here a barren,

223
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:29,772
Desolate world.

224
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:34,550
Woeful faces,

225
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,817
Startled eyes,

226
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:44,551
Hearts beating and stopping;

227
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:46,300
It was feared

228
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,835
That Ammi Begum

229
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:52,816
May not be able to take this sorrow,

230
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:55,535
But

231
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:59,663
Her little games of cricket served her well.

232
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:02,083
She'd known

233
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,500
That the player can get bowled

234
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,624
Even

235
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:11,453
On a ball he could've easily scored a four on.

236
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:15,596
By the way, your wound's alright now.

237
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:20,450
You think it's alright.

238
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,935
I feel like an old wound's been opened again.

239
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,824
Munshi Alam,

240
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:30,824
May I ask you something?

241
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,394
Why did Neelam throw a pebble at me?

242
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:46,503
Apparently, she couldn't find anything better.

243
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:47,987
She

244
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:53,440
Saw you outside the graveyard, didn't she?

245
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,473
What else

246
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:58,596
Could she find there besides a pebble?

247
00:19:07,724 --> 00:19:10,969
What should I prepare for dinner?

248
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:14,204
Nothing. I'm not hungry.

249
00:19:14,204 --> 00:19:16,547
You're not right now.

250
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:19,921
Soon, you will be.

251
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:25,921
What, now, does the stomach know about serious wounds?

252
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:29,084
Ammi Begum

253
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:35,037
Didn't have anything for two days, too.

254
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:37,762
I don't know how long

255
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:42,242
The others starved themselves.

256
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,700
They started eating again, soon.

257
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,389
Just like they always used to.

258
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,255
They used to laugh,

259
00:19:56,255 --> 00:20:00,918
Have a right merrymaking...

260
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:05,218
And play cricket, too?

261
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:14,449
No.

262
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:19,668
Nobody there plays cricket now.

263
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:03,507
So did the pebble strike him,

264
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:08,071
Or did you just pick one up and fling it towards him?

265
00:21:08,071 --> 00:21:11,602
Hit him right on his forehead, Ammi Begum.

266
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:17,563
Blood gushed out like a fountain before my eyes.

267
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:38,845
Stop it, Nano...

268
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:40,129
Let me

269
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:42,950
Have a good laugh, you wee lassie!

270
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,100
It's about time the rapscallion's reckoning began.

271
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,809
It delights me to hear

272
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,698
That the reprobate is getting sentenced,

273
00:21:52,698 --> 00:22:00,729
And the sentence is being carried out in the present instant itself!

274
00:22:04,463 --> 00:22:09,699
Didn't he say anything in return?

275
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:14,817
No.

276
00:22:14,817 --> 00:22:17,978
He just kept staring at me, wide-eyed.

277
00:22:17,978 --> 00:22:20,269
The esurient lad!

278
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:25,533
Look at how he came here, running, the moment I signed the will;

279
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:26,491
Otherwise,

280
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:32,393
He'd been in hiding for eight long years.

281
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:36,899
I've given him half the property from Suraiyya and Fatima's share

282
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,300
Of the bequeathal.

283
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,628
I thought Mashood Ahmed may ask me when I go up there,

284
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:45,737
Now,

285
00:22:45,737 --> 00:22:52,161
You can't send photocopies up there, otherwise, I'd shove one in his face, saying,

286
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:56,242
'The piece of land that goes to your son'

287
00:22:56,242 --> 00:23:03,518
'Is one where cacti blossom, Mashood Ahmed'!

288
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,530
Has he brought his wife and children along?

289
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,912
He was alone there, Nano.

290
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:19,178
He must be staying at one of those hotels...

291
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:24,874
Ask Dastoor to send him the will,

292
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:33,975
And say, 'It'll take time for Kaneez Begum to die'.

293
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:39,990
Everything shall be divided after my death.

294
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,083
His accursed self will be before my Maheen's eyes.

295
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:51,381
Give him his share of the money and kick him on the back, saying,

296
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,882
'Begone'!

297
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:58,735
'Go back to where you came from'!

298
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:04,544
In your place, I'd blooter him!

299
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:09,469
But I wouldn't be there...

300
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,420
What happened that night?

301
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,143
Tell me, what happened that night?

302
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:51,802
When?

303
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:57,643
The night of the wedding.

304
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:02,072
When I'd left.

305
00:25:04,866 --> 00:25:19,100
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

306
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:37,209
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

307
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:46,762
<i>In the tale of love</i>

308
00:25:46,762 --> 00:26:03,177
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

309
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:12,638
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i>

310
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:22,013
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

311
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:32,536
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

312
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,462
Did you see that?

313
00:26:50,462 --> 00:26:53,746
Even as Judgement Day approaches,

314
00:26:53,746 --> 00:27:00,834
The expressions of companionship don't change.

315
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:03,785
'Expression'

316
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:06,412
Is an English word, Ammi Begum.

317
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:09,018
Shut up, Dastoor Ahmed.

318
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:11,033
Look over there.

319
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:16,241
She cares for the birds even to this day.

320
00:27:16,241 --> 00:27:20,265
The twit has no idea

321
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:26,902
They'd fly away the moment they get the opportunity to.

322
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:32,657
She was saying,

323
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:38,534
'Ammi Begum's fine now'.

324
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:42,102
'I'll be leaving shortly'.

325
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:46,952
What's it to me?

326
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:50,952
I'll fall ill again!

327
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,075
Come.

328
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,520
Here.

329
00:28:30,816 --> 00:28:35,945
I had my reason for leaving her, Munshi Alam.

330
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:39,895
I have evidence for everything.

331
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:43,957
You have but regret.

332
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:46,519
Perfidy has no reason, and

333
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,926
Regret has no evidence.

334
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:53,694
I'm dying, Munshi Alam.

335
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:59,895
You just feel you're dying.

336
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:01,199
I've seen

337
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:04,303
Those who die.

338
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:08,865
They quieten,

339
00:29:08,865 --> 00:29:12,135
Are petrified,

340
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:17,135
And forget even to blink.

341
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:21,260
Today,

342
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,323
You shall get a certified copy of the will.

343
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:27,543
You

344
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:30,823
May leave before nightfall,

345
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:31,683
Otherwise,

346
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:35,266
One of these days, I may say to you in person that I

347
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:37,983
Find your very existence

348
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:41,229
Miasmic.

349
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,140
Talk to me, Munshi Alam.

350
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,512
Please, talk to me.

351
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:52,886
Tell me what happened that night.

352
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:57,042
You're under Dado's oath.

353
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:11,598
Have a bit more.

354
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:19,576
I'm leaving, Nano...

355
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:29,044
Go.

356
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:44,629
Start running faster.

357
00:30:44,629 --> 00:30:50,145
Once you've learnt to speak loudly,

358
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:51,655
For once,

359
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:53,219
Come here

360
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:56,670
And show me.

361
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,675
I would like to

362
00:31:01,675 --> 00:31:07,321
Capture that moment in my eyes.

363
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:21,604
It's not an order, Chief,

364
00:31:21,604 --> 00:31:25,198
Just my wish.

365
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:46,033
Alright, Uncle.

366
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:54,265
I'll be back, Ammi Begum.

367
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:04,359
Whatever is it

368
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:11,025
That I should bless you with, my dear?

369
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,708
He kept looking for a trace

370
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:35,941
Of where you were.

371
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:38,770
The clock struck 10.

372
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:42,980
There were so many calls from Kaneez Mahal,

373
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,853
He

374
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:47,348
Answered one with uncertainty,

375
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:50,643
And didn't answer a handful.

376
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:54,925
And when Dr Imran told him

377
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:56,534
That he's left,

378
00:32:56,534 --> 00:33:01,368
He made a run for it.

379
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:04,978
Everybody over at Kaneez Mahal had their suspicions,

380
00:33:04,978 --> 00:33:06,175
But

381
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:10,334
Everyone played their part in the pasquinade.

382
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,349
Looking at each other,

383
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:19,971
They'd smile for no reason.

384
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:22,614
Everyone was distressed,

385
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:27,644
And nobody knew what was going to happen.

386
00:33:27,644 --> 00:33:28,780
Then

387
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,003
Came that moment.

388
00:33:32,003 --> 00:33:35,377
He barged into Kaneez Mahal suddenly, panting,

389
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:41,301
But everybody's eyes searched for you by his side.

390
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:42,753
But

391
00:33:42,753 --> 00:33:44,596
You

392
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:47,706
Were nowhere.

393
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:49,504
You'd

394
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:53,004
Left.

395
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Where's that bleedin' bridegroom?

396
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,134
Where is he?

397
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:24,433
Where's Maheen?

398
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:27,973
C -- Come with me.

399
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:30,605
Come.

400
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:37,563
His phone's switched off.

401
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,375
Let it remain switched off, mate.

402
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,050
He'll be here.

403
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:09,789
He's left.

404
00:35:09,789 --> 00:35:16,132
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

405
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:23,913
And left a letter addressed to you.

406
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,149
Give me the letter.

407
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:38,452
Dear Maheen,

408
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:41,044
It has been a pleasure

409
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:43,816
That this chapter of our love began,

410
00:35:43,816 --> 00:35:47,731
And we fell in love;

411
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:56,899
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

412
00:35:56,899 --> 00:36:00,492
Such love that you agreed to marry me.

413
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,835
Splendid.

414
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:06,552
Does one wager oneself in one's quest for revenge?

415
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:09,198
And your sister Fajr,

416
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:13,666
She always kept guessing you'd fallen for me!

417
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:15,464
You silly girl,

418
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:19,307
At least you could've thought of Gulrez, if none of them.

419
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:21,821
He kept writhing in love like an animal to be sacrificed,

420
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:26,665
And kept on doing what you wanted him to.

421
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:31,586
Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,

422
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:35,365
But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,

423
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:39,198
And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,

424
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:43,245
One has to yield.

425
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,442
I depart a victor,

426
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:47,319
And I say this as I leave,

427
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:49,344
'Bless you'

428
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:52,895
'With this closing checkmate'.

429
00:36:50,143 --> 00:37:04,439
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

430
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:18,299
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

431
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:27,393
<i>Ask all you will what comes out of love</i>

432
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:39,000
<i>The heart is its creator, and ends up being destroyed by it</i>

433
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
