1
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,848
Done, done, done!

2
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,379
I'd say you

3
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,799
Head for Dado's; we'll get ready and come.

4
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:07,509
Okay.

5
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:08,600
See you.

6
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,920
Bye.

7
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
May I go?

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,966
Why not? Go.

9
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,331
Listen!

10
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:16,826
Up there

11
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,036
On the writing table

12
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,966
Is Maheen's diary.

13
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,186
I think

14
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,727
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,478
Please,

16
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,198
Don't read it.

17
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,528
Who knows what it may conceal!

18
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:31,728
Come on, mate.

19
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,954
I don't read others' diaries.

20
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:35,152
Well,

21
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:37,193
May nobody read the diary of one

22
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:40,913
Who's accused of loving someone else.

23
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:44,263
And don't even touch

24
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:46,805
Your enemy's diary!

25
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,793
Otherwise, friendship with her will be impossible.

26
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,539
Alright,

27
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,598
Bye.

28
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:55,809
Bye.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,958
Have to dash!

30
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,480
It's a love marriage,

31
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:08,311
Innit?

32
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,730
What does it look like?

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,521
It's 100% a love marriage.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,030
Someone must've told you.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,018
No?

36
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,128
Not at all.

37
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:20,199
Nobody told me.

38
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,798
How do you know, then?

39
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:26,138
It's etched

40
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:28,189
On the girl's face.

41
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,708
If you ask her to close her eyes,

42
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,408
She opens them repeatedly.

43
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,658
Why?

44
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,052
She doesn't quite believe it, I think,

45
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:40,731
And she tries to see it again

46
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:42,580
To believe it.

47
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,068
Even if you tell her a good joke,

48
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:47,458
She says, 'Hmm... What was that'?

49
00:02:47,503 --> 00:02:49,310
And she's chuffed to have someone

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,621
Who'd get her decked up quickly!

51
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,850
And she starts laughing

52
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,360
Like you are every now and then.

53
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,800
You're almost ready.

54
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,490
In just a moment, now, you...

55
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,428
Here, Nano.

56
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,911
The bride's jewellery.

57
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,968
Come here, let me kiss your forehead.

58
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,398
May you live long.

59
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,536
On the writing table

60
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,627
Is Maheen's diary.

61
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,679
I think

62
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,511
She forgot to keep it in the drawer.

63
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:10,939
Please,

64
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:12,672
Don't read it.

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,671
Who knows what it may conceal!

66
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,061
Well,

67
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:19,251
May nobody read the diary of one

68
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:22,941
Who's accused of loving someone else.

69
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:28,480
And don't even touch

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,140
Your enemy's diary!

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,328
Is it that Gulrez loves me,

72
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:06,148
Or that he worships me?

73
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,218
I start to question myself

74
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:12,739
If I'd ever be able to take such love.

75
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,769
Please, Gulrez,

76
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,010
Keep on loving me.

77
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,178
In time, I'll learn to take it.

78
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,449
Neelam told me today

79
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,479
That you'd purchased a bindiya [ornament] for me.

80
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,859
I smiled coyly to myself for long.

81
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,749
What are you made of, Gulrez,

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,019
Remembering every single detail like you do?

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,071
That muppet, that London tramp,

84
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,981
He's landed in Karachi.

85
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:44,661
Looking at him, I'm reminded of his slap.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,218
There is but one thing my heart longs for,

87
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:52,098
And that is the day when I'd get even with him.

88
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:18,890
♪ <i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from</i> ♪

89
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:28,330
♪ <i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i> ♪

90
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:39,241
♪ <i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart...</i> ♪

91
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,728
Why are you smiling?

92
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:17,398
These looks could kill

93
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:20,388
Anybody unfortunate enough to meet your gaze!

94
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,778
You look so sweet!

95
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,280
My gaze would only meet his today.

96
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,102
It'll be like an offering unto him.

97
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,908
Dastoor!

98
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,628
Come here.

99
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,229
Yes, Ammi Begum?

100
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,380
The Reverend is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

101
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,491
Call the nincompoop, ask him to come here with the procession.

102
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:14,980
Alright.

103
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:17,481
Listen,
-Yes?

104
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,950
Just say what I've told you, and not a word beyond it. Go, now.

105
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,689
Alright, Ammi Begum.

106
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:25,798
There, now!

107
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,958
Would you look at this wee lassie!

108
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,020
The filly's showing up now!

109
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,498
Go!

110
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,939
Why are you quiet?

111
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,910
You're quiet.

112
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:43,929
That's why.

113
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,040
I don't know why, Ali,

114
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,770
But my heart grows restless.

115
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,209
Doesn't it?

116
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
What do you mean?

117
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,580
My heart grows restless too.

118
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,398
Would you like some water?

119
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,807
Aye.

120
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:01,648
I'll get some.

121
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,700
Splendid!

122
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,438
Just as the Lord has willed!

123
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,310
Come on.

124
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,749
Don't tarry too much.

125
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,929
As if I have to deck up like a bride, mate!

126
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,179
Just give me 15 minutes,

127
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,519
And I'll be ready.

128
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:46,519
Let's see...

129
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,139
Make it quick.

130
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,298
It'll take a while, Uncle,

131
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,862
He's dressing up like the groom.

132
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,672
He'll make haste only if you ask him to,

133
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:07,613
The Reverend over here is going over the top of the dishes, gorbing everything he can.

134
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,740
Sir,

135
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,968
Where's the loo?

136
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,348
This way.

137
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:14,709
What's there this way, Uncle?

138
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,218
I'm not saying it to you, mate!

139
00:10:17,218 --> 00:10:20,469
Go, Reverend, the loo's this way.

140
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,458
Waqar!

141
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,988
This phone is switched off.

142
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,280
Waqar, please answer me.

143
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,973
Your phone's switched off too!

144
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,329
Waqar, everyone's waiting over there!

145
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,368
Waqar!

146
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,508
Waqar!

147
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,048
Waqar!

148
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,428
Waqar?

149
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,288
'Dear Maheen,'

150
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:48,018
'It has been a pleasure'

151
00:12:48,288 --> 00:12:50,988
'That this chapter of our love began,'

152
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,161
'And we fell in love;'

153
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:56,288
'Such love that you agreed to marry me.'

154
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,758
'Splendid.'

155
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:01,788
'Does one wager oneself in one's quest for revenge?'

156
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,111
'I could've taken two slaps from you had you just said it;'

157
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:11,591
'Why did you have to play this elaborate game just to avenge one slap?'

158
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,050
'Do you have any idea how many people here love you?'

159
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:20,262
'There are many besides Gulrez who adore you with all their lives.'

160
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:23,112
'Take Ammi Begum, for instance,'

161
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,713
'She'd kick her sense of justice away when it'd come to you.'

162
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:29,461
'Aunt Suraiyya,'

163
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,903
'Your mother,'

164
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:33,516
'Do you have any idea how many woes she's gone through?'

165
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:35,556
'And your sister Fajr,'

166
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:39,666
'She always kept guessing you'd fallen for me!'

167
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,030
'You silly girl,'

168
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,687
'At least you could've thought of Gulrez, if none of them.'

169
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,879
'He kept writhing in love like an animal to be sacrificed,'

170
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,177
'And kept on doing what you wanted him to.'

171
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,269
'Honestly,'

172
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,689
'Is he in on this one?'

173
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:01,639
'He doesn't seem the type, though.'

174
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,660
'He's very simple.'

175
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:05,703
'He endures sorrow,'

176
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,560
'But never gives anyone any.'

177
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,178
'I thought for long before I threw away the sherwani about what it was --'

178
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,619
'What were you up to?'

179
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,289
'At first, it occurred to me'

180
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,989
'That I should let the vaudeville commence,'

181
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,989
'But then thought'

182
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,831
'That if, amidst this vaudeville, we got espoused, your face would be smirched by my name.'

183
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,631
'Gulrez has done me so many favours'

184
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,294
'That I find it improper that he should get to wear what I shall take off. Which is why...'

185
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:35,152
'I'm leaving.'

186
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,028
'I won't be coming back.'

187
00:14:38,107 --> 00:14:39,498
'And listen,'

188
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,289
'Never before had I wished that you should taste defeat by my hand,'

189
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:46,938
'But my heart says that I should leave you bitterly defeated today,'

190
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,179
'And show you, Maheen, that to triumph in the name of love,'

191
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:53,494
'One has to yield.'

192
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,409
'I depart a victor,'

193
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:58,609
'And I say this as I leave,'

194
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,610
'"Bless you"'

195
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,974
'"With this closing checkmate".'

You'd left,

But

224
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,229
Left here a barren,

225
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:27,838
Desolate world.

226
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:33,789
Woeful faces,

227
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,679
Startled eyes,

228
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,558
Hearts beating and stopping;

229
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:45,978
It was feared

230
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,718
That Ammi Begum

231
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:51,359
May not be able to take this sorrow,

232
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,218
But

233
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:58,748
Her little games of cricket served her well.

234
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,771
She understood

235
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:05,880
That the player can get bowled

236
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,480
Even

237
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,700
On a ball he could've easily scored a four on.

238
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,628
By the way, your wound's alright now.

239
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,057
You think it's alright.

240
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:23,628
I feel like an old wound's been opened again.

241
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:26,208
Munshi Alam,

242
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,818
May I ask you something?

243
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,160
Why did Neelam throw a pebble at me?

244
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,528
Apparently, she couldn't find anything better.

245
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,558
She

246
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,601
Saw you outside the graveyard, didn't she?

247
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,338
What else

248
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:57,043
Could she find there besides a pebble?

249
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,958
What should I prepare for dinner?

250
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:13,269
Nothing. I'm not hungry.

251
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,979
You're not right now.

252
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,520
Soon, you will be.

253
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,058
What, now, does the stomach know about serious wounds?

254
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,508
Ammi Begum

255
00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:32,067
Didn't have anything for two days, too.

256
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:37,548
I don't know how long

257
00:19:37,548 --> 00:19:39,798
The others starved themselves.

258
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,829
They started eating again, soon.

259
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,078
Just like they always used to.

260
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,060
They used to laugh,

261
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,741
Have a right merrymaking...

262
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,899
And play cricket, too?

263
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,989
No.

264
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:16,848
Nobody there plays cricket now.

265
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,988
So did the pebble strike him,

266
00:21:03,168 --> 00:21:07,900
Or did you just pick one up and fling it towards him?

267
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,931
Hit him right on his forehead, Ammi Begum.

268
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,191
Blood gushed out like a fountain before my eyes.

269
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,679
Stop it, Nano...

270
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,010
Let me

271
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,710
Have a good laugh, you wee lassie!

272
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:46,753
It's about time the rapscallion's reckoning began.

273
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:49,610
It delights me to hear

274
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,409
That the reprobate is getting sentenced,

275
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:58,388
And the sentence is being carried out in the present instant itself!

276
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,578
Didn't he say anything in return?

277
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,086
No.

278
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:17,817
He just kept staring at me, wide-eyed.

279
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:19,837
The esurient lad!

280
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:25,187
Look at how he came here, running, the moment I signed the will;

281
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,398
Otherwise,

282
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:30,169
He'd been in hiding for eight long years.

283
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:36,700
I've given him half the property from Suraiyya and Fatima's share

284
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,029
Of the bequeathal.

285
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:44,408
I thought Mashood Ahmed may ask me when I go up there,

286
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:45,497
Now,

287
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:51,968
You can't send photocopies up there, otherwise, I'd shove one in his face, saying,

288
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:55,988
'The piece of land that goes to your son'

289
00:22:55,988 --> 00:23:00,997
'Is one where cacti blossom, Mashood Ahmed'!

290
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,418
Has he brought his wife and children along?

291
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,748
He was alone there, Nano.

292
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:18,588
He must be staying at one of those hotels...

293
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:23,838
Ask Dastoor to send him the will,

294
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:30,828
And say, 'It'll take time for Kaneez Begum to die'.

295
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,978
Everything shall be divided after my death.

296
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:44,721
His accursed self will be before my Maheen's eyes.

297
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:51,152
Give him his share of the money and kick him on the back, saying,

298
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,681
'Begone'!

299
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,921
'Go back to where you came from'!

300
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,768
In your place, I'd blooter him!

301
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,589
But I wouldn't be there...

302
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,902
What happened that night?

303
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,858
Tell me, what happened that night?

304
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,538
When?

305
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,797
The night of the wedding.

306
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,869
When I'd left.

Shut up, Dastoor Ahmed.

320
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,731
Look over there.

321
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:14,963
She cares for the birds even to this day.

The twit has no idea

323
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:24,144
They'd fly away the moment they get the opportunity.

324
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,618
She was saying,

00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:49,312
I'll fall ill again!

329
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,099
Come.

330
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,588
Here.

331
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,168
I had my reasons for leaving her, Munshi Alam.

332
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,141
I have evidence for everything.

333
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,361
You have but regret.

334
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,391
Perfidy has no reason, and

335
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,740
Regret has no evidence.

336
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,911
I'm dying, Munshi Alam.

337
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,460
You just <i>feel</i> you're dying.

338
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,968
I've seen

339
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:03,388
Those who die.

340
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:06,047
They quieten,

341
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,791
They're petrified,

342
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:15,455
Too petrified to remember to blink.

343
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,938
Today,

344
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,030
You shall get a certified copy of the will.

345
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,298
You

346
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,048
May leave before nightfall,

347
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:31,540
Otherwise,

348
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,120
One of these days, I may say to you in person that I

349
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,828
Find your very existence

350
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:39,898
Miasmic.

351
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,427
Talk to me, Munshi Alam.

352
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,898
Please, talk to me.

353
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,119
Tell me what happened that night.

354
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,338
You're under Dado's oath.

355
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,658
Have a bit more.

356
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,669
I'm leaving, Nano...

357
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,218
Go.

358
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,928
Start running faster.

359
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:48,148
Once you've learnt to speak loudly,

360
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,550
For once,

361
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,988
Come here

362
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:55,052
And show me.

363
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,328
I would like to

364
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:05,398
Capture that moment in my eyes.

365
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,128
It's not an order, Chief,

366
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,420
Just my wish.

367
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,818
Alright, Uncle.

368
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,008
I'll be back, Ammi Begum.

369
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,699
Whatever is it

370
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,622
That I should bless you with, my dear?

371
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,159
He kept looking for a trace

372
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,928
Of where you were.

373
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,898
The clock struck 10.

374
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:42,458
There were so many calls from Kaneez Mahal,

375
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:43,667
He

376
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,788
Answered one or two with uncertainty,

377
00:32:47,118 --> 00:32:49,898
But the rest... He didn't answer...

378
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,727
And when Dr Imran told him

379
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,367
That you've left,

380
00:32:56,367 --> 00:32:58,517
He made a run for it.

381
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,838
Everybody over at Kaneez Mahal had their suspicions,

382
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:05,978
But

383
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:09,168
Everyone played their part in the pasquinade.

384
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:12,290
Looking at each other,

385
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,908
They'd smile for no reason.

386
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,088
Everyone was distressed,

387
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:25,638
And nobody knew what was going to happen.

388
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:28,640
Then

389
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,868
Came that moment.

390
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,180
He barged into Kaneez Mahal suddenly, panting,

391
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,598
But everybody's eyes searched for <i>you</i> by his side.

392
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,441
But

393
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,950
You

394
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,321
Were nowhere.

395
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,053
You

396
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,290
Were long gone...

397
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,267
Where's that bleedin' bridegroom?

398
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,748
Where is he?

399
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,938
Where's Maheen?

400
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,888
C -- Come with me.

401
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:29,338
Come.

402
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,260
His phone's switched off.

403
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,230
Let it remain switched off, mate.

404
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,968
He'll be here.

405
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,649
He's left.

406
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:12,848
He took off and threw away his sherwani,

407
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,418
And left a letter addressed to you.

408
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,438
Give me the letter.

409
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,808
'Dear Maheen,'

410
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:40,278

00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,610
