1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine you're playing against the British Empire.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm not as great a cricketer as he's making it sound like.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Toss the coin.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I go from our side?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got this one.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heads or tails?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heads.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe my Mum wrote these letters.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you recognise her handwriting?

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's hers alright...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why did she say she's innocent until her last moment?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish she were.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wish it were all a lie.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know she lost her memory after the accident.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She remembered my name,

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not my face.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Despite everything, the last words on her mouth were,

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'm innocent, Jiya'...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'm innocent'...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This --

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's this Aurangzeb?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My friend.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So to speak.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew him only

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because your mother was my wife.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They were class-fellows

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At University.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He loved your mother.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And your mother

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Admitted that she, too,

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had begun to like him at one point.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then she got married.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Met Aurangzeb

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On a plane.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We just exchanged pleasantries

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the plane,

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it wasn't long before we became friends.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He started coming at our place.

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I felt

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if Aurangzeb and your mother

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Already knew each other.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was most perplexed.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could say

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had my suspicions.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To confirm them,

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never stopped him from coming,

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even though

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He never invited me over.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In fact, he never told me

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where he lived.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I got home one day,

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw him leave in a hurry.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His mouth was dripping blood.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seeing him run away,

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hid behind the wall.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wiping the blood, he made a run for it

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like a thief.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I got in,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother was very upset.

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seeing me,

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She lost it.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was broken,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But somehow, I managed to ask your mother

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What he was doing

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my absence,

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how she ended up with a wound on her forehead,

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he on his lip.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother answered everything

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like someone

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Caught red-handed.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like someone

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking for any kind of excuse - sensible or not.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But excuses can only shield concupiscence so well...

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my daughter,

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I want to make it clear

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if a man agrees to anything less than modesty,

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's better off not marrying at all.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None but Aurangzeb

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave me these letters

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After your mother left.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And these</i>

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Were written after our marriage.</i>

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonderful!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo hoo!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YAY!

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back off...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Five balls, eight runs to win.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go forth, m'lad.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give the Royal Army a proper pasting!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're hoping for too much.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you don't make it, I don't want to see your face.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember, boss...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez is the last man in the way to certain victory.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm the only man

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's gonna lead us down that way.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Action stations. Go.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Five balls, eight runs! Make it quick!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you see?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm making way.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're celebrating already!

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Battlestations!

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Four balls, four runs! We just need one four! Just one!</i>

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
O Lord...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one more awful ball...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOO HOO!

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Victory!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well done, partner.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to bowl.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We may've found our next star!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Much appreciated!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your mother answered everything

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like someone

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Caught red-handed.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like someone

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking for any kind of excuse - sensible or not.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my daughter,

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I want to make it clear

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if a man agrees to anything less than modesty,

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's better off not marrying at all.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send the invoice.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya...

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You called me?</i>

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got to say, Papa...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you too...

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you so much, Jiya...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout dinner tomorrow?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, love.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dinner tomorrow it is.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love you, my dear...

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're still shy?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just talk to her!

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will, when the date is fixed.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you gonna say?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And how, monsieur le Marié?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're tongue-tied before her!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You struggle to catch your breath!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't that bad, Aunt.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't as cowardly

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As I look.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to her.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it, Aunt.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once the date is fixed,

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How I take her on a date.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You gonna hold her hand?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I will!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll pull her into a corner.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be awed

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At everything I say!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord...

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear that, Neelam?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hear him talk!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you think he's even gonna touch her?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it, Aunt...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd tremble if his hand

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much as brushed hers!

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scaredy-cat!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you call me a scaredy-cat?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because no one plans in love, you twit!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor says, 'You'll see'!

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just do it for everyone to see!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You challenging me?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For real.

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do it.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize my hand

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'll go on a date with you. Right now.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

188
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,609
Why are you sitting like that?

189
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:29,310
I'm tired of this world.

190
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,010
Look at your little self, mate.

191
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,940
I may be young --

192
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,284
'But I'm more experienced than the old', innit?

193
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,668
So...

194
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,649
How's it feel to be defeated?

195
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,818
Oh, lovely. Just called my friends in London to tell 'em how Gulrez's started hitting fours.

196
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,161
Flowers. For you.

197
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,248
Hey! Thanks.

198
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,401
This garland looks like a ring of flowers.

199
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:02,977
I know.

200
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,480
The same as in running rings round someone.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I lost on purpose!

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Elementary, innit?

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had to, partner.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Winning doesn't nearly feel that good.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looking at the faces of those who lose is uniquely painful.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at them...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks like they all won when I lost...

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're quite skilled at it, you know...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Losing a match you've almost won.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Nano fixes the date for Maheen and Gulrez's engagement,

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can adorn the grave of your victory here with that garland.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because there ain't gonna be

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A next over.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've decided

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To marry

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i>

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i>

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me...</i>

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i>

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>And feast on my heart...</i>

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And sit where I'm sitting.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can that be?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit where you sit.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad would slap me

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my dreams!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm asking you

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To sit here.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mashood Ahmed from over there.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it now.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, Ammi Begum,

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You always look at him once

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before saying something important.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pass the spittoon.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who asked you to come here?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, you?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked me.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'It's time we fixed a date for the engagement'.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It must've slipped out, m'lad.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go out.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Send Mehrunnisa in.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But this is gonna look so insulting...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks to what you say, she's started thinking

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she's suddenly become wise.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, sit.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But quietly.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen quietly

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until the date is fixed.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quietly, okay?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What would be a good day?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't, Ammi Begum...

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been waiting for two hours.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how long it takes to fix the date?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A little over two hours?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been two hours.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea,

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it won't be much longer.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The engagement's taking so long.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine how long the wedding will take.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd be sitting for months before fixing a date for the wedding.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In principle, we got engaged the moment I agreed.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder what this formality's all about...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Watch what you say.

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh...

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just felt like having a cuppa...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mhm!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay right where you are.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You too.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better act like you're getting engaged.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But could someone tell me when?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or are they gonna keep it to themselves?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the last

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forty years,

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All engagements on Mondays and Tuesdays

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Broke. Without exception.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
8 out of 10 on Wednesdays

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't break...

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those on Thursdays and Fridays

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ended in marriage. All of them.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Friday it is.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you say?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said 'Friday it is'.

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare say Saturday or Sunday.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say something, Suraiyya Begum?

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got engaged on a Friday too.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout a Saturday or Sunday this time?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here...

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We had

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Six engagements on Saturdays.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Four got married.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And on Sundays...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
7 of 8 got married...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday it is then.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday it is.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sunday.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear engagements on Sundays don't break.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eight in the family got engaged on Sundays

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the last 40 years.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one broke.

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good luck.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you, I got to go.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't wait six days!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't taking chances! It must be confirmed!

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Sunday would be too late...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just here to say...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've overstayed your welcome.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't come back if you leave this time.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't come back if you leave this time.
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want her to wear

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Red on her engagement?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it there.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me something else.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She likes this one.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're talking.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd look like a fairy in this one.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't like it.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want her to look like a fairy.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want her to look like a bride.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A proper bride.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Covered, protected...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's wrong with this blue one?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember, Ammi Begum,

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wore a blue suit on my engagement.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said back then, too,

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You look just like a fairy, Suraiyya'...

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The higher your fairy flew,

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The harder she fell...

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd rather not have another fairy here, Ammi Begum...

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pick whatever you like.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Not this one.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tear that, will you?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's time for a new picture.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With you holding the gun.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think you're aiming for Waqar Ahmed's head?

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're talking about aiming!

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just pulled the trigger!

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's gonna die for real.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, he's not.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just on the rack.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's a hundred prerequisites to dying, my dear.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The first... Is torment!

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I was thinking.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't let him die so easily.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, guess what, he ain't going down that easy, Maheen Aurangzeb!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The living ought to know

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That those who die on purpose mean business!

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much does he pay you?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Running these campaigns for him, making a gentleman out of him, and shielding the nasty piece of work that he is?

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how nasty he is?

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's keep it under the wraps, shall we? Everyone loves him so much.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who doesn't know him?

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You sure don't.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't that bad.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know him a bit too.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the London tramp gets tired of his English roses,

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He comes to Pakistan for a change of taste!

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This time, he wanted to get the big fish.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such as?

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such as Maheen Aurangzeb!

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But his plot failed here.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I made mincemeat of him!

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to tell me about <i>your</i> plot?</i>

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't plot.

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I decide, my dear.

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting engaged to Gulrez

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is but your 'decision'?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever slept in peace

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since you made this decision?

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is your heart at ease for a moment?

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it hurt?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doesn't it awaken you from your sleep

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say, 'You're gonna ruin me in your revenge plot, you imbecile'!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The least your poor heart would ask you

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is if you actually got engaged on Sunday,

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happens on Monday?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There'll be no Sunday after this one, Maheen Aurangzeb.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Days change,

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But changed days like to have their way.

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you feel like torturing someone on Monday,

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can't be sure that tramp's gonna be in the city to take it.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if he went back?

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left on Sunday night?

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if someone's told him...

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't come back again'

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If you leave now'?

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you say, Ammi Begum?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr...

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call her here.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to take her pick.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I figured I ought to tear it for real after you left.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As I was about to, I thought...

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't like this back then.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All that's left of childhood is the memories...

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ought to hold on to memories...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But why are you here?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let his company spoil you!

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't be peeping into others' rooms.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know,

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eight people got engaged on Sundays in our family in the last 40 years.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one broke.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because the girl didn't want to marry him.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No more of your balderdash.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
None of what I've said in the last few days

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Qualifies as balderdash.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've seen and heard it myself.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He leaves on Sunday.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was arguing with his agent.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't so lucky

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As to get a flight

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before Sunday.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be gone forever on Sunday.

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I've asked him to.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't ever come back if you go'.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He won't be coming back, Maheen.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
