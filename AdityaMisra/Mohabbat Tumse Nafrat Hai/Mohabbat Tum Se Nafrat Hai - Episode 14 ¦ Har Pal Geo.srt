1
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,928
Imagine you're playing against the British Empire.

2
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:21,079
But I'm not as great a cricketer as he's making it sound like.

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,518
Toss the coin.

4
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,099
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,201
May I go from our side?

6
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,501
No.

7
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,520
I got this one.

8
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:52,781
Heads or tails?

9
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:53,971
Heads.

10
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,048
I can't believe my Mum wrote these letters.

11
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,292
Can you recognise her handwriting?

12
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,498
It's hers alright...

13
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,642
But...

14
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,848
But why did she say she's innocent until her last moment?

15
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,942
I wish she were.

16
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:13,862
I wish it were all a lie.

17
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:18,752
I know she lost her memory after the accident.

18
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,241
She remembered my name,

19
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,358
But not my face.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,978
Despite everything, the last words on her mouth were,

21
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:37,782
'I'm innocent, Jiya'...

22
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:39,985
'I'm innocent'...

23
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,022
Who --

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,225
Who's this Aurangzeb?

25
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,951
My friend.

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,083
So to speak.

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,334
I knew him only

28
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:07,474
Because your mother was my wife.

29
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,620
They were class-fellows

30
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,784
At University.

31
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,808
He loved your mother.

32
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:20,898
And your mother

33
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:23,398
Admitted that she, too,

34
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:26,038
Had begun to like him at one point.

35
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:31,403
But then she got married.

36
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,633
I

37
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,293
Met Aurangzeb

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,288
On a plane.

39
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,669
We just exchanged pleasantries

40
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,938
On the plane,

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,988
But it wasn't long before we became friends.

42
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,760
He started coming to our place.

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,250
But I felt

44
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,757
As if Aurangzeb and your mother

45
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,258
Were already acquainted.

46
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,038
I was most perplexed.

47
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,437
You could say

48
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,457
I had my suspicions.

49
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:14,898
To confirm them,

50
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:19,387
I never stopped him from coming,

51
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,536
Even though

52
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,952
He never invited me over.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,817
In fact, he never told me

54
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,848
Where he lived.

55
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,757
When I got home one day,

56
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,289
I saw him leave in a hurry.

57
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,698
His mouth was dripping blood.

58
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,998
Seeing him run away,

59
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:04,928
I hid behind the wall.

60
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:09,448
Wiping the blood, he made a run for it

61
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:12,012
Like a thief.

62
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,097
When I got in,

63
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,237
Your mother was very upset.

64
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:22,688
Seeing me,

65
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:24,540
She lost it.

66
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,039
I was broken,

67
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,979
But somehow, I managed to ask your mother

68
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,928
What he was doing

69
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,148
In my absence,

70
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,350
And how she ended up with a wound on her forehead,

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,785
And he on his lip.

72
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,180
Your mother answered everything

73
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,804
Like someone

74
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:55,051
Caught red-handed.

75
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,690
Like someone

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,836
Looking for any kind of excuse - sensible or not.

77
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,407
But excuses can only shield concupiscence so well...

78
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,365
You're my daughter,

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,408
So I want to make it clear

80
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:21,401
That if a man agrees to anything less than modesty,

81
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,950
He's better off not marrying at all.

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,960
None but Aurangzeb

83
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,803
Gave me these letters

84
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,310
After your mother left.

85
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:43,995
And <i>these</i>

86
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,871
Were written <i>after</i> our marriage.

87
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,086
Wonderful!

88
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,443
Woo hoo!

89
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,241
YAY!

90
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,460
Dado!

91
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,998
Back off...

92
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,438
Five balls, eight runs to win.

93
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:38,959
Go forth, m'lad.

94
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,080
Give 'em blasted Redcoats a proper pasting!

95
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,377
Go.

96
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:46,118
You're hoping for too much.

97
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,777
If you don't make it, I don't want to see your face.

98
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,438
Remember, boss...

99
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:08,628
Gulrez is the last man in the way to certain victory.

100
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,498
You don't know

101
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,288
I'm the only man

102
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,819
Who's gonna lead us down that way.

103
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,208
Action stations. Go.

104
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:22,030
Five balls,

105
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,140
Eight runs!

106
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,671
Make it quick!

107
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,468
Gulrez!

108
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,429
WOO HOO!

109
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,560
What was that?

110
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,318
Didn't you see?

111
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm making way.

112
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,080
They're celebrating already!

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,237
Hmm...

114
00:09:57,357 --> 00:09:58,067
Go.

115
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,392
Battlestations!

116
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:04,304
Four balls, four runs! We just need <i>one</i> four! Just one!

117
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,598
O Lord...

118
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:12,549
Just one more awful ball...

119
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,758
WOO HOO!

120
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,084
Victory!

121
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,451
Well done, partner.

122
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,212
Way to bowl.

123
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,572
We may've found our next star!

124
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:37,053
Much appreciated!

125
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,837
Your mother answered everything

126
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,484
Like someone

127
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:00,735
Caught red-handed.

128
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,315
Like someone

129
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,396
Looking for any kind of excuse - sensible or not.

130
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,695
You're my daughter,

131
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,644
So I want to make it clear

132
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,860
That if a man agrees to anything less than modesty,

133
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,230
He's better off not marrying at all.

134
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,919
Okay.

135
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:52,019
Send the invoice.

136
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,031
Jiya...

137
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,598
<i>You</i> called <i>me</i>?

138
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,578
Got to say, Papa...

139
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:10,328
I love you...

140
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,591
I love you too...

141
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,290
I love you so much, Jiya...

142
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,542
How 'bout dinner tomorrow?

143
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,078
Yes, love.

144
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:24,799
Dinner tomorrow it is.

145
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,340
Love you, my dear...

146
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,778
You're still shy?

147
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,028
Just talk to her!

148
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,709
I will, when the date is fixed.

149
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,230
What are you gonna say?

150
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,998
And how, monsieur le Marié?

151
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:40,280
You're tongue-tied before her!

152
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,841
You struggle to catch your breath!

153
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,651
It ain't that bad, Aunt.

154
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,528
I ain't as cowardly

155
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,469
As I look.

156
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,415
Okay...

157
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,869
So...

158
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,668
Talk to her.

159
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,480
I will.

160
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,977
There.

161
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,388
I mean it, Aunt.

162
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,899
Once the date is fixed,

163
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:08,228
You'll see

164
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,198
How I take her on a date.

165
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:12,229
You gonna hold her hand?

166
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,903
I swear I will!

167
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,029
I'll pull her into a corner.

168
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,227
You'll be awed

169
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:20,397
At everything I say!

170
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:22,738
By the Lord...

171
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:24,485
Hear that, Neelam?

172
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,258
Hear him talk!

173
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:28,578
D'you think he's even gonna touch her?

174
00:14:28,578 --> 00:14:30,429
Forget it, Aunt...

175
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,740
He'd tremble if his hand

176
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,780
So much as brushed hers!

177
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,503
Scaredy-cat!

178
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,330
Why'd you call me a scaredy-cat?

179
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,890
Because no one plans in love, you twit!

180
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,950
Nor says, 'You'll see'!

181
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,299
You just do it for everyone to see!

182
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,777
You challenging me?

183
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,259
Aye.

184
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,017
For real?

185
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,454
For real.

186
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,050
Do it. For real.

187
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,430
Seize my hand

188
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,011
And I'll go on a date with you. Right now.

189
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,090
Hmm?

190
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,918
Gulrez will toss the coin for me.

191
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,517
Why are you sitting like that?

192
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,937
I'm tired of this world.

193
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,869
Look at your little self, mate.

194
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,970
I may be young --

195
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,909
'But I'm more experienced than the old', innit?

196
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,611
So...

197
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,280
How's it feel to be defeated?

198
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,158
Oh, lovely. Just called my friends in London to tell 'em how Gulrez's started hitting fours.

199
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,171
Flowers. For you.

200
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,099
Hey! Thanks.

201
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:01,389
This garland looks like a ring of flowers.

202
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:02,861
I know.

203
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,390
The same as in running rings round someone.

204
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,758
I lost on purpose!

205
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,470
Elementary, innit?

206
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,248
Had to, partner.

207
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:22,729
Winning doesn't nearly feel that good.

208
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,117
Looking at the faces of those who lose is uniquely painful.

209
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,088
Look at them...

210
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,659
Looks like they all won when I lost...

211
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:37,191
You're quite skilled at it, you know...

212
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,828
Losing a match you've almost won.

213
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,718
When Nano fixes the date for Maheen and Gulrez's engagement,

214
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,338
You can adorn the grave of your victory here with that garland.

215
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,180
Because there ain't gonna be

216
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,880
A next over.

217
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:27,310
♪ <i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance?</i> ♪

218
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,249
I've decided

219
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:30,614
To marry

220
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:32,130
Gulrez.

221
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:41,480
♪ <i>What good is writhing and smouldering in your remembrance</i> ♪

222
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:50,819
♪ <i>What is union and separation to one struck by love</i> ♪

223
00:18:50,819 --> 00:19:00,240
♪ <i>What is this illusion you, O Love, create, and then expunge</i> ♪

224
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:09,597
♪ <i>Quaff the blood out of me...</i> ♪

225
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:19,088
♪ <i>Quaff the blood out of me and feast on my heart</i> ♪

226
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:23,550
♪ <i>And feast on my heart...</i> ♪

227
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,868
Get up...

228
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,198
And sit where I'm sitting.

229
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:08,139
How can that be?

230
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,869
I wouldn't dare

231
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:12,208
Sit where you sit.

232
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,849
Dad would slap me

233
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,899
In my dreams!

234
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,058
I'm asking you

235
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,226
To sit here.

236
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,259
I can see

237
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,229
Mashood Ahmed from over there.

238
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,898
Okay.

239
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,549
I get it now.

240
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,719
But, Ammi Begum,

241
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:48,070
You always look at him once

242
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:50,869
Before saying something important.

243
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,581
Pass the spittoon.

244
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:55,842
Here.

245
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,261
Who asked you to come here?

246
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,061
Why, you?

247
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,285
You asked me.

248
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:11,806
'It's time we fixed a date for the engagement'.

249
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,958
It must've slipped out, m'lad.

250
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,950
Go out.

251
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:22,239
Send Mehrunnisa in.

252
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,108
As you say.

253
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:39,359
But this is gonna look so insulting...

254
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:43,599
Thanks to what you say, she's started thinking

255
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,198
That she's suddenly become wise.

256
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:48,838
Hmm.

257
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:51,558
Okay, sit.

258
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:54,344
But quietly.

259
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:58,009
Listen quietly

260
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,290
Until the date is fixed.

261
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,290
Quietly, okay?

262
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,760
Okay.

263
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,967
Tell me...

264
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:11,877
What would be a good day?

265
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,087
I won't, Ammi Begum...

266
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,018
I've been waiting for two hours.

267
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:51,486
You know how long it takes to fix the date?

268
00:22:51,486 --> 00:22:53,002
A little over two hours?

269
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:54,853
It's been two hours.

270
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,003
No idea,

271
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:58,103
But it won't be much longer.

272
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,000
The engagement's taking so long.

273
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,058
Imagine how long the wedding will take.

274
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:05,306
They'd be sitting for months before fixing a date for the wedding.

275
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,148
In principle, we got engaged the moment I agreed.

276
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,357
Wonder what this formality's all about...

277
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:14,280
Maheen...

278
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,362
Have some shame.

279
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,388
Watch what you say.

280
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,144
Uhh...

281
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,488
Just felt like having a cuppa...

282
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,773
Mhm!

283
00:23:22,823 --> 00:23:25,186
Stay right where you are.

284
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,495
You too.

285
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,897
You better act like you're getting engaged.

286
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,057
I will.

287
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:38,904
But could someone tell me when?

288
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,515
Or are they gonna keep it to themselves?

289
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,318
In the last

290
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:04,948
Forty years,

291
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:09,789
All engagements on Mondays and Tuesdays

292
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,690
Broke. Without exception.

293
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,940
8 out of 10 on Wednesdays

294
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,831
Didn't break...

295
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,227
But...

296
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:27,530
Those on Thursdays and Fridays

297
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,450
Ended in marriage. All of them.

298
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,459
So...

299
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:39,490
I say...

300
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,108
Friday it is.

301
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,030
What d'you say?

302
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,677
You said 'Friday it is'.

303
00:24:45,677 --> 00:24:48,677
I wouldn't dare say Saturday or Sunday.

304
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:52,077
Why don't you say something, Suraiyya Begum?

305
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:56,667
I got engaged on a Friday too.

306
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,938
Okay...

307
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,308
How 'bout a Saturday or Sunday this time?

308
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,977
Aye?

309
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,689
Here...

310
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,171
We had

311
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:26,539
Six engagements on Saturdays.

312
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,629
Four got married.

313
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:31,429
And on Sundays...

314
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:35,448
7 of 8 got married...

315
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,483
Sunday...

316
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,408
Sunday it is then.

317
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,918
Aye.

318
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,919
Sunday it is.

319
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,741
Sunday.

320
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:16,098
I hear engagements on Sundays don't break.

321
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,870
Eight in the family got engaged on Sundays

322
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,122
In the last 40 years.

323
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,958
Just one broke.

324
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,808
Good luck.

325
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,779
I told you, I got to go.

326
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,949
I can't wait six days!

327
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,444
I ain't taking chances! It must be confirmed!

328
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,848
No, Sunday would be too late...

329
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,418
Just here to say...

330
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:09,168
You've overstayed your welcome.

331
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,218
I say...

332
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:21,808
Don't come back if you leave this time.

333
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:22,868
Don't come back if you leave this time.
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

334
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:35,880
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

336
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,969
You want her to wear

337
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:55,948
Red on her engagement?

338
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,341
Keep it there.

339
00:27:57,341 --> 00:27:59,467
Show me something else.

340
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,613
Aye...

341
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,568
She likes this one.

342
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,758
Now you're talking.

343
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:18,903
She'd look like a fairy in this one.

344
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,001
But I don't like it.

345
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:24,882
I don't want her to look like a fairy.

346
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,979
I want her to look like a bride.

347
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,008
A proper bride.

348
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,767
Covered, protected...

349
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,059
But...

350
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:42,879
What's wrong with this blue one?

351
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,988
Remember, Ammi Begum,

352
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:51,348
I wore a blue suit on my engagement.

353
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,628
You said back then, too,

354
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,238
'You look just like a fairy, Suraiyya'...

355
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,021
The higher your fairy flew,

356
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,174
The harder she fell...

357
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,654
We'd rather not have another fairy here, Ammi Begum...

358
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,019
Pick whatever you like.

359
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,890
Just... Not this one.

360
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,819
Tear that, will you?

361
00:31:02,938 --> 00:31:04,078
Why?

362
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,650
It's time for a new picture.

363
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,500
With you holding the gun.

364
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,150
Don't you think you're aiming for Waqar Ahmed's head?

365
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,011
You're talking about aiming!

366
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:16,222
I just pulled the trigger!

367
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,391
He's gonna die for real.

368
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,178
No, he's not.

369
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,388
Just on the rack.

370
00:31:21,388 --> 00:31:24,518
There's a hundred prerequisites to dying, my dear.

371
00:31:24,518 --> 00:31:27,087
The first... Is torment!

372
00:31:27,191 --> 00:31:28,958
That's what I was thinking.

373
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:31,399
You won't let him die so easily.

374
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:35,022
Well, guess what, he ain't going down that easy, Maheen Aurangzeb!

375
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,468
The living ought to know

376
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:40,598
That those who die on purpose mean business!

377
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,408
How much does he pay you?

378
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,708
For?

379
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:55,319
Running these campaigns for him, making a gentleman out of him, and shielding the nasty piece of work that he is?

380
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:57,332
You know how nasty he is?

381
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:00,448
Let's keep it under the wraps, shall we? Everyone loves him so much.

382
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:02,260
Who doesn't know <i>him</i>?

383
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,371
<i>You</i> sure don't.

384
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:05,948
It ain't that bad.

385
00:32:05,948 --> 00:32:07,709
I know him a bit too.

386
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,790
When the London tramp gets tired of his English roses,

387
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,978
He comes to Pakistan for a change of taste!

388
00:32:14,388 --> 00:32:17,950
This time, he wanted to get the big fish.

389
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,203
Such as?

390
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,864
Such as Maheen Aurangzeb!

391
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:25,416
But his plot failed here.

392
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,867
I made mincemeat of him!

393
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,408
Care to tell me about <i>your</i> plot?

394
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:34,309
I don't plot.

395
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:37,008
I decide, my dear Fajr.

396
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,268
So...

397
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,849
Getting engaged to Gulrez

398
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,269
Is but your 'decision'?

399
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,739
Ever slept in peace

400
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:51,409
Since you made this decision?

401
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,248
Is your heart at ease for a moment?

402
00:32:55,398 --> 00:32:57,248
Doesn't it hurt?

403
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,008
Doesn't it awaken you from your sleep

404
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:06,088
And say, 'You're gonna ruin me in your revenge plot, you imbecile'!

405
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,860
The least your poor heart would ask you

406
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,330
Is if you actually got engaged on Sunday,

407
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,321
What happens on Monday?

408
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,878
There'll be no Sunday after this one, Maheen Aurangzeb.

409
00:33:24,638 --> 00:33:26,190
Days change,

410
00:33:26,248 --> 00:33:29,109
But changed days like to have their way.

411
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,141
If you feel like torturing someone on Monday,

412
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:36,682
You can't be sure that tramp's gonna be in the city to take it.

413
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:41,222
What if he went back?

414
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,191
What if

415
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:45,622
He left on Sunday night?

416
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,491
What if someone's told him...

417
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,570
'Don't come back again'

418
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,461
'If you leave now'?

419
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,979
What d'you say, Ammi Begum?

420
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:57,689
Fajr...

421
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:59,139
Call her here.

422
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,363
She ought to take her pick.

423
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,788
I figured I ought to tear it for real after you left.

424
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,039
As I was about to, I thought...

425
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,111
He wasn't always like that.

426
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,973
All that's left of childhood is the memories...

427
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:41,734
You ought to hold on to memories...

428
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:44,564
But why are you here?

429
00:35:44,564 --> 00:35:46,710
Don't let his company spoil you!

430
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,248
You shouldn't be peeping into others' rooms.

431
00:35:49,308 --> 00:35:50,668
D'you know,

432
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:54,809
Eight people got engaged on Sundays in our family in the last 40 years.

433
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:56,888
Just one broke.

434
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,729
Because the girl didn't want to marry him.

435
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,844
Please.

436
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:02,825
No more of your balderdash.

437
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,406
None of what I've said in the last few days

438
00:36:06,406 --> 00:36:08,827
Qualifies as balderdash.

439
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,069
I've seen and heard it myself.

440
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,039
He leaves on Sunday.

441
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,188
He was arguing with his agent.

442
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:26,608
He wasn't so lucky

443
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,011
As to get a flight

444
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:31,513
Before Sunday.

445
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,058
He'll be gone forever on Sunday.

446
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,918
Because I've asked him to.

447
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:41,190
'Don't ever come back if you go'.

448
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,170
He won't be coming back, Maheen.

449
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,940
Ever.

450
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
