1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,717
Punish me any way you like.

2
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,177
But, before you do anything...

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,659
Just... Hear me out... For once?

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,225
I just did.

5
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,661
That's enough for today.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,878
I'll hear the rest if we see each other another day.

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,568
Have it your way...

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,038
I hope...

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,728
That you never come here again.

10
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,279
Only a father

11
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,259
Could come back

12
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:15,919
After being

13
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,481
Kicked out so many times!

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,571
Close the door!

15
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,318
Playin' alone, I see!

16
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,328
Where's

17
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:57,928
Mr Fracture?

18
00:01:57,928 --> 00:01:59,278
No idea.

19
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,528
Hi!

20
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,908
Hi!

21
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:03,988
Hmm!

22
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,408
I guess you're over the grief of your injury by now.

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,651
I guess you've got a taste of how it feels by now.

24
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:22,968
It's a minor fracture. It'll heal.

25
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:25,589
It was a minor bruise. It healed.

26
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,821
If it's healed...

27
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,062
Brace yourself for the next one.

28
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,758
Why didn't you go after him?

29
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,339
For the love of the Lord, Neelam...

30
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:59,406
He ran like he wasn't Gulrez...

31
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,929
But a spirit!

32
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,988
Okay, I'll call him.

33
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,488
No good.

34
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,991
He left his phone in my car.

35
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,401
He was in a hurry.

36
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,212
Good Lord...

37
00:03:11,212 --> 00:03:13,293
You're worried, aren't you?

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,016
Of course!

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,479
So am I.

40
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,662
What's he gonna do?

41
00:03:21,662 --> 00:03:24,663
You'll find out in a few minutes...

42
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,332
My heart's sinking!

43
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,133
It's nothing like that.

44
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:29,674
Don't worry.

45
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,386
You know where he's gone, don't you?

46
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,704
Aye.

47
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,065
He's betting everything he's got.

48
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,379
What?

49
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:43,927
The way I did...

50
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,056
And won.

51
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,101
What are you saying, Wali?

52
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,570
Just pray he plays his move and wipes the floor with his opponent.

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,461
Oh...

54
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,992
You mean he's gone to see Maheen?

55
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,664
You are so intelligent!

56
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,941
It's so simple, Wali.

57
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,741
When Gulrez's type bet everything,

58
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:10,361
They play a gamble where the first move is the only one that's legal.

59
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,590
I'll talk to you later...

60
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:15,128
Got to pray for now...

61
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,538
Gulrez!

62
00:04:37,598 --> 00:04:39,887
What's with the panting?

63
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,088
No --

64
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,058
Just --

65
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:43,890
Had to dash...

66
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,042
Where's Aunt?

67
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:47,872
Aunt and Maheen ain't here.

68
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,421
Go to my room.

69
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:51,650
I'll get you a cuppa. And some kebabs.

70
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,854
No...

71
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,241
No kebabs...

72
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:55,731
Just the cuppa.

73
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,972
She made them!

74
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:00,822
Really?

75
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:03,932
Gotta try 'em, I guess!

76
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,487
Where were you all these days?

77
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,407
Where were <i>you</i>?

78
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,078
Me or her?

79
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,888
It was no good, really.

80
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,311
My paying a visit won't change nothin' here.

81
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,608
As if <i>my</i> paying a visit would.

82
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,458
Which bowler thinks if he's got the wicket before throwing the ball?

83
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,818
Just throw the ball, mun!

84
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:24,630
That's why I'm here.

85
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,779
I'm gonna

86
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,529
Bowl a yorker

87
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,190
That'll take the wicket!

88
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,108
Now you're suckin' diesel, man!

89
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,828
I hope... She won't mind it?

90
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:37,998
Mind?

91
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:41,005
Why are you worried about that?

92
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,145
No...

93
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,834
I don't...

94
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,630
Just remembered... She breaks stuff in her fury...

95
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,678
She does, aye.

96
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:54,133
That's why we never leave any vases in her room!

97
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,049
Scared yet?

98
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,678
No vases...

99
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:03,449
No fear.

100
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,461
By the way...

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,759
May I call her? I'm sure I can tell her everything.

102
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,770
No way.

103
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,901
You can say it,

104
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,480
But she can't know your feelings!

105
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,412
Aye...

106
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,651
I never thought about that...

107
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,011
And...

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,627
It looks a bit... Shameless, to be honest...

109
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:27,994
But I think... I'd seize her hand and pull her into a corner...

110
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:31,123
Who told you it looks shameless?

111
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:35,285
Seize her hand, pull her into a corner, and say...

112
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,643
Thought anything?
-What?

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,927
What are you gonna tell her?

114
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:45,715
You're underestimating me... I've thought of the finest things to say!

115
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:49,099
Then stay here! She'll be back in two hours!

116
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,453
Two hours?

117
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:54,594
She's gone shopping. It's Jiya's birthday.

118
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:55,705
Oh...

119
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,220
Good...

120
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,347
By the way...

121
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,539
Didn't you go to college?

122
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,960
Just one class today.

123
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,941
Thought I'd skive off.

124
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,484
Very bad.

125
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,470
Where's Aunt?

126
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,950
At Nano's.

127
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,557
Great.

128
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:19,978
What?

129
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,720
You scared of her too?

130
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,627
No, it's just --

131
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,768
If I seized her hand...

132
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:27,958
Aye?

133
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,270
I'd die of shame if Aunt saw me!

134
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,086
You don't know anything, do you?

135
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,600
Aunt would be delighted to see it!

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,984
She's waiting for you to play your move!

137
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:43,228
Guess

138
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,279
That's your kebabs!

139
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,079
Could you show me that one?

140
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,488
This one, ma'am?
-No, the other one.

141
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,949
5,500.

142
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,460
I don't care.

143
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,878
Pack it.

144
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,557
And this orange one!

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
Excuse me...

146
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,719
Yes, sir?

147
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,926
How much for this one?

148
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,906
It's sold out. Except the blue one.

149
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,406
No, I want the orange one.

150
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,587
She just bought it.

151
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,338
Not yet, she didn't.

152
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,688
Maheen?

153
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,218
I almost thought it's your doppelgänger.

154
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:39,039
If you've bought it, okay, I'll get something else.

155
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,539
Forget it.

156
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,809
Or sell it

157
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,519
To whoever you want.

158
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,517
5,500?

159
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,688
Yes.

160
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,808
Here.

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,168
Excuse me!

162
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,738
What's your problem?

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,098
Wanted to tell you something.

164
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:51,178
And say sorry for the slap.

165
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,390
Say it's okay quick or they'll think there's something going on between us!

166
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,677
Shut up!

167
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,111
I've asked the cook to have dinner ready by 1.30.

168
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:15,468
No... I think I'll pass.

169
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:17,248
But she won't.

170
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:20,759
She said she wants lunch ready by 1.30!

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,220
By the way,

172
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,068
Why won't you have anything?

173
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,439
I say, fill yourself up before she gets here.

174
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,201
Eat like an SIL eats at his in-laws.

175
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,888
Hold your horses, Fajr.

176
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:36,529
Not so fast!

177
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,008
I mean it.

178
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:41,599
Any opportunity could be your last, Gulrez!

179
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,969
As they say in the Army...

180
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:47,989
'You can get in, but there's no getting out'!

181
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,679
Where'd you learn that?

182
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,539
There...

183
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:52,759
What?

184
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:55,257
It doesn't suit you!

185
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,285
I mean, you're just a wee girl!

186
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,037
Oh, please, Gulrez,

187
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:00,675
I ain't all that wee!

188
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,275
I see a man's face

189
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,605
And I know what's on his mind.

190
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,650
Every wee girl grows up fast

191
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,638
Thanks to the cads.

192
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:13,070
A couple of 'em have asked for my number too. For real!

193
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,060
Please, Fajr...!

194
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,929
Swear to me...

195
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,340
What?

196
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,320
1.30... Or 2.30...

197
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,755
You ain't leavin' before talkin' to her!

198
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,792
Blimey...

199
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,013
We're all wasting ourselves,

200
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,446
Grieving for you, but you!

201
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,521
You don't seem to care!

202
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:34,286
I mean, gather some courage, mun!

203
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,547
I've got a lot of courage. And when the time comes, you'll see it!

204
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,619
Well, guess what, the time's come. But it'll go after 1.30.

205
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:43,920
What?

206
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,841
I mean... Hide somewhere in the lobby as soon as it's 1.30.

207
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,109
Why?

208
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,000
Jesus, mun...

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,760
She'd be back at 1.30, Sherlock!

210
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,091
So?

211
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:57,060
The moment she sets foot here,

212
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,298
Seize her hand and pull her into a corner!

213
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,278
Oh...

214
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,209
I get it now, mate...

215
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,669
The name's Fajr!

216
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,980
Okie doke, Fajr...

217
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,970
Just wait for 1.30...

218
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,810
Yes!

219
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,137
That's like the brave man you are!

220
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,067
Thought I'd come shopping. Jiya's throwing a party tonight. It's her birthday.

221
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,532
That wastes my shopping.

222
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,046
How?

223
00:13:41,676 --> 00:13:44,813
I wouldn't be caught dead there. Not with <i>you</i> around!

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,731
She's your friend! Your best buddy!

225
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,777
Anyway, enjoy the free coffee... I'm paying.

226
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,768
I can pay for my cup, thank you!

227
00:13:57,508 --> 00:13:59,069
Alright, honestly...

228
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,709
Are you just angry over the slap or do you actually hate me?

229
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:04,875
Honestly?

230
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,336
I've got no idea

231
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:09,497
If it's just a bit of anger or if I actually hate you.

232
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:12,670
Why'd you come here for coffee then?

233
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,244
You asked me.

234
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,365
You said you'd say sorry.

235
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,414
It felt kinda nice.

236
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:19,826
Sorry...

237
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,568
Say that you're ashamed...

238
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:27,428
And you shouldn't have slapped me.

239
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:31,118
The Colonel would've thrown us in the nick if I didn't slap you!

240
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:32,209
Still...

241
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,268
You shouldn't have slapped me.

242
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,114
Okay, I shouldn't have. Fine?

243
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,558
Hmm.

244
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,778
What 'hmm'?

245
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,088
Say it's okay!

246
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:44,525
Promise me

247
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,918
I'll be the Chief

248
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,858
As long as I live.

249
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,886
How long will that be?

250
00:14:49,886 --> 00:14:51,071
Shut up!

251
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,948
Don't worry, Madame...

252
00:14:53,948 --> 00:14:55,780
I ain't here for long.

253
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,863
I'd leave as soon as you get married...

254
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:00,810
<i>I</i> get married?

255
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,379
Pretty soon, yeah.

256
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:05,470
Don't act like you don't know it.

257
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,798
Poor old Gulrez is dying for you.

258
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,648
And aye,

259
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:16,126
I saw him running...

260
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,568
He said he was going to see you.

261
00:15:18,622 --> 00:15:20,669
Said he'd give the news in 10 minutes.

262
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,338
Running?

263
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,416
Wasn't he in his Foxy?

264
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,358
The blighter's in for it.

265
00:15:30,393 --> 00:15:31,678
Why?

266
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,937
For loving you?

267
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,430
Know what the mannies say in London?

268
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,901
They say you better not let her know you've fallen for her,

269
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:44,274
Or she'd kill you off where you won't have an ounce of relief.

270
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:45,874
He sent you?

271
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:47,125
Who?

272
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:51,975
C'mon mate, I was just shopping when I happened to see you!

273
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,435
So anyway...

274
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:56,890
Aren't you serious about Gulrez?

275
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,070
Is there someone else?

276
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,229
Please, Waqar...

277
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,049
Just askin' as a friend!

278
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,430
When'd we become friends?

279
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,027
How 'bout just now? Not a big deal!

280
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,378
So...?

281
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,808
C'mon!

282
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,088
Your hand's gone a bridge too far.

283
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:14,780
No?

284
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,627
Mind your hand, Waqar...

285
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,392
They're all watching!

286
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,438
Since you've brought it up... Mind if I say something?

287
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:28,549
You won't find someone like Gulrez.

288
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,760
He'd die for you.

289
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,990
Okay, bye!

290
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,017
Gulrez!

291
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,007
Gulrez!

292
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,728
She here?

293
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,373
No. It's 1.35.

294
00:17:30,373 --> 00:17:32,710
Hide in the lobby! She'd be on her way!

295
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,977
Ah, yes.

296
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,147
And hey...

297
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:36,190
Don't worry.

298
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,800
I'll take care of everything else.

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,171
You would?

300
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,981
How?

301
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,379
Anyway...

302
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:44,010
Don't worry.

303
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,898
I'll face it all.

304
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,198
Come what may!

305
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,978
Hello? Maheen?

306
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,628
Did Gulrez get there?

307
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,418
He's right here. Just had lunch.

308
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,439
Where's Mum?

309
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,630
At Nano's.

310
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,311
When'd he get there?

311
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,252
No idea.

312
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,057
Something special?

313
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,140
Definitely.

314
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,861
He's waiting for you.

315
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,852
He said he's here to see you.

316
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,475
He seems serious this time!

317
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:21,339
And - I mean it - very brave!

318
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,750
Brave?

319
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,590
Aye, like a bowler

320
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,290
Who takes a good look at the ball before throwing it?

321
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,388
Determined to claim a wicket this time?

322
00:18:31,454 --> 00:18:33,928
That's what he looks like.

323
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,380
He even told me, 'You underestimate me, Fajr'!

324
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,531
Where's he?

325
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:41,971
In the lobby.

326
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,897
Wherever he is, he's waiting for you.

327
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,650
Tell him to come over to Nano's.

328
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,648
That's where I'm headed.

329
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,968
Gulrez!

330
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,594
Blimey, mate...

331
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,160
You made me jump.

332
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,697
What are you doing here?

333
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,340
1.45!

334
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,280
Come.

335
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,205
Where?

336
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,646
I'm waiting!

337
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,346
No need now.

338
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,781
She's waiting for you now.

339
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:32,227
Where?

340
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,910
Come with me.

341
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,801
Let's work on plan B.

342
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,288
Plan B?

343
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,597
What about plan A?

344
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,688
She's gone over to Nano's.

345
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:46,318
She ain't coming here.

346
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,707
Please, grab a pew.

347
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:52,691
You came here to do something, yes?

348
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,867
I just told you.

349
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,650
Then remember...

350
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,978
You won't get this chance again.

351
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:01,978
What chance?

352
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,121
When you're determined to strike when the iron's hot,

353
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,510
It's do

354
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,999
Or die!

355
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:12,605
Over to Nano's now?

356
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,695
So intelligent!

357
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,239
I'll seize her hand before everyone,

358
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,890
And pull her into a corner!

359
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,751
I'm gonna remember that the next time someone says, 'Gulrez hasn't got the guts'!

360
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,392
I'm that someone...

361
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,993
I say I ain't that brave.

362
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,607
I can strike from the lobby.

363
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,943
Not over there.

364
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,031
Thank you for the lunch.

365
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,050
It was very nice.

366
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,870
Does she know I'm here?

367
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,859
Aye.

368
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,483
Who told her?

369
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:57,664
Me.

370
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:01,209
Did you tell her how long I've been waiting?

371
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:02,447
Aye.

372
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,789
She still went to Nano's?

373
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:06,920
Jesus, mate! You and your questions!

374
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,151
Didn't I just tell you?

375
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:11,678
It ain't a question, mate.

376
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:15,488
I'm just... Reflecting on it... And her...

377
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,870
I'm trying to guess

378
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,310
What'd happen if I struck

379
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,217
When the iron's hot.

380
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,927
I swear...

381
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,460
It'd burn me...

382
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,587
Bye.

383
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,098
He said sorry...

384
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,259
And that he shouldn't have slapped me.

385
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:02,868
Then took me out for coffee,

386
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:04,709
And extended a hand, saying,

387
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:06,509
'Let's be friends'!

388
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,878
And?

389
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:08,898
What?

390
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:11,005
I said, 'back off'.

391
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:14,929
Hmm...

392
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,520
As in, 'No way we're making friends'...

393
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:22,351
Yes!

394
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:26,004
Spiffing, m'girl.

395
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,689
Making friends with the enemy amounts to surrender.

396
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,792
Who knows you better than me?

397
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,556
You fight

398
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:44,164
To win. Always.

399
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:45,305
Right.

400
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:46,866
Hey!

401
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:49,587
If he wants to make friends,

402
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:51,428
What's the problem, Ammi Begum?

403
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:54,129
The wretch's a proper London tramp.

404
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:57,564
Who knows what he means by 'friendship'!

405
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,114
Hey...

406
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,926
If he extends his hand again,

407
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,567
Let him have a taste of yours!

408
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,998
What are you saying?

409
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,750
You live for the sound of his name, Ammi Begum.

410
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,967
But when he wants to make friends with her, he suddenly becomes your enemy!

411
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,600
Put a sock in it, Mehrunnisa.

412
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,676
Oh, please...

413
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,159
I'm not a kid.

414
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:26,650
I know him inside out.

415
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,367
Nano's right.

416
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:29,560
The London tramp

417
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,838
Is friends with God-knows how many girls.

418
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:33,919
I don't think he's the type.

419
00:23:33,982 --> 00:23:37,136
No way Mashood Ahmed's son is that type.

420
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:39,321
Don't pronounce a judgement just yet.

421
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:43,274
Upbringing changes people.

422
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:46,065
No one's guessing anything here.

423
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,962
I'm just reading what he said.

424
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:50,926
What?

425
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,139
Not long ago, he was telling Gulrez here...

426
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,610
'Tales of love aren't heard of'

427
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,971
'Outside India and Pakistan'.

428
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:03,719
'In London',

429
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,137
'We have'

430
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:06,470
'"Friendships"'...

431
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,478
Hey!

432
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:11,758
He was telling Gulrez a lot about his 'friendships'.

433
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:17,155
The poor lad left begging forgiveness!

434
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,906
Good Lord...

435
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,890
That what he's like?

436
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,368
I tell you,

437
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:27,649
This lad's gonna trouble Mashood's soul... Not give it some peace...

438
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,519
Don't say that, Ammi Begum...

439
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:30,967
Blimey...

440
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,050
You don't have to look far.

441
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,841
On his way back from London --

442
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,062
What's her name?

443
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,897
Your friend, you know?

444
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:43,960
Jiya?

445
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,531
Aye, her.

446
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,201
He brought her along.

447
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:52,030
I hear they talk on the phone for hours.

448
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,179
Sees her in private too.

449
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,550
His injured arm...

450
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,887
Aye?

451
00:24:59,607 --> 00:25:02,198
Who d'you think he went to see in that state?

452
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:03,307
Who?

453
00:25:03,307 --> 00:25:06,707
That blasted lassie, of course.

454
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,750
No way, Nano.

455
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,327
She ain't the type.

456
00:25:10,327 --> 00:25:12,827
They just met on the plane

457
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:15,952
And became friends at my mention.

458
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:18,987
I'm 75 now, girl...

459
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:24,089
I can see right through a girl 75 feet away.

460
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,150
Anyway...

461
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,453
What's it to us?

462
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,607
Whether Jiya's that type or not...

463
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,071
God keep her happy.

464
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,156
It's her birthday today.

465
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,491
Is it?

466
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,067
Happy birthday to her.

467
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:52,928
You going?

468
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,959
No.

469
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,469
Why?

470
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,776
Didn't you go shopping for her party?

471
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:03,422
Stop speaking in English, for the love of the Lord!

472
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,318
Of course,

473
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:06,839
Ammi Begum.

474
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,907
So...

475
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,968
Why aren't you going, love?

476
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,504
Because <i>he</i>'s going!

477
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:19,581

478
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,098

'You shall be recompensed in full.'

512
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,159
You wrote that?
-Not fair, Neelam.

513
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,785
Why'd you steal it?

514
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,362
You twit! I didn't steal it!

515
00:28:55,362 --> 00:28:56,860
I've just been reading...

516
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,740
And...

517
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,987
God, it's so sweet!

518
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,637
Why don't you read it to her?

519
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,047
Who?
-Maheen.

520
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,098
I swear, she'd be dying for your love.

521
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,637
Oh, please...

522
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,021
She'd rather laugh it off.

523
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:15,292
She'd say, 'Never thought the numbskull mime could rhyme'!

524
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,410
I went to see her.

525
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,590
Whoa!

526
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,508
And?

527
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:25,440
I almost gathered the courage to talk to her.

528
00:29:26,342 --> 00:29:30,132
I was afraid, but swore I'd tell her everything.

529
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,343
Good! How'd it go?

530
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,125
What?

531
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:38,592
She ran off to her Nano's

532
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,703
The moment she found out I'd come to her place.

533
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,038
You could've gone to Nano's!

534
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,438
How?

535
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:48,310
I love her.

536
00:29:48,638 --> 00:29:51,206
I'll face her. But never tail her!

537
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,976
Know what,

538
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,988
Love and poetry

539
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:00,838
Speak to the heart.

540
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:06,162
To someone so uninterested... Best to pocket the poetry part and lock the words in your heart.

541
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,940
Ain't she shining so bright?

542
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,797
Munshi Alam!

543
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,329
Munshi Alam!

544
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,018
Aye?

545
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,387
Could you go with the driver and give it to Jiya?

546
00:30:57,387 --> 00:31:00,746
If she asks about me... Just say -- I couldn't come.

547
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:03,228
What if she asked why?

548
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:05,234
Tell her you don't know.

549
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:10,086
And if she asks why my phone's switched off, tell her -- The situation forced me...

550
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,891
I'm not going to Jiya's birthday party.

551
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,849
Feel free to go there.

552
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,347
Munshi Alam!

553
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,890
Uhh...

554
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,270
Change of plans.

555
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,797
You guys enjoying here?

556
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,414
Have some juice. Please.

557
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:21,070
I'll be right back, okay?

558
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,281
Where are you?

559
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,357
Happy birthday, Jiya.

560
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:42,447
What?

561
00:32:42,537 --> 00:32:44,490
Sorry I couldn't be there.

562
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,761
'Sorry' my foot!

563
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:50,179
Get here right now or I'm comin' to get you!

564
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:53,020
Stop it, mate... What about the guests?

565
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,148
I can't come. There. That's it.

566
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:56,883
Why?

567
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,138
Big deal, mate. Easy.

568
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:01,809
Yeah, big deal. Go on.

569
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:04,528
I'll say the same. I can't come.

570
00:33:04,528 --> 00:33:09,380
Please, enjoy the party. And save some cake for me. I'll have it tomorrow.

571
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:11,260
You don't know me.

572
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,239
There's no party without you!

573
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:15,945
I'll send everyone back.

574
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,631
What? You crazy?

575
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,131
Is Maheen there?

576
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,716
Aye. So?

577
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:23,420
So, your best friend's there. What else d'you want?

578
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,558
I'm giving you 30 minutes. If you don't come, I'm sending your Maheen back.

579
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:31,090
No birthday. No celebration.

580
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,740
30 minutes or?

581
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,850
Hi! How are you, Sania?

582
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,080
Great! Happy birthday!

583
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,311
Thank you so much!

584
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,738
Your time starts...

585
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:42,188
Your time starts... Now!

586
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,519
Ahoy, matey!

587
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,230
You're here?

588
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,417
Just called Waqar.

589
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:54,498
I mean --

590
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,580
He promised me he'd be here.

591
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,150
He'll be here.

592
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,111
We'll wait for 30 minutes.

593
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,532
Aww, thank you!

594
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,890
Good for Maheen, though.

595
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,237
She went to Nano's from the mall.

596
00:34:16,293 --> 00:34:19,234
Or Gulrez's courage would be lying dead here.

597
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:20,454
Why?

598
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:26,085
You don't know it, Mum, but he was gasping for breath as he got closer to his moment!

599
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,013
He was having cold sweats too.

600
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:30,344
Stammering too.

601
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:34,416
And when he found out

602
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,972
Maheen's gone over to Ammi Begum's? What'd he say?

603
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,387
I said

604
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:42,237
He ought to go there and say it for all to hear!

605
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,306
Impossible.

606
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:46,763
That's what he said.

607
00:34:46,763 --> 00:34:48,679
Sorta. Impossible.

608
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:51,207
The utter poltroon.

609
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,520
For a moment, I felt

610
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,416
He's not one.

611
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,490
He just...

612
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,673
Fears her rejection.

613
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,512
She won't.

614
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:02,950
She's just toying with him.

615
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
