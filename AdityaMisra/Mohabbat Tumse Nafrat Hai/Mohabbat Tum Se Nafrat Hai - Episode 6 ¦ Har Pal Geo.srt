1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Punish me any way you like.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But, before you do anything...

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Hear me out... For once?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just did.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's enough for today.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hear the rest if we see each other another day.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have it your way...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope...

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you never come here again.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only a father

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could come back

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After being

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Kicked out so many times!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close the door!

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Playin' alone, I see!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Fracture?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess you're over the grief of your injury by now.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess you've got a taste of how it feels by now.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a minor fracture. It'll heal.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was a minor bruise. It healed.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's healed...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brace yourself for the next one.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you go after him?

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the love of the Lord, Neelam...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ran like he wasn't Gulrez...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But a spirit!

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I'll call him.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No good.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left his phone in my car.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was in a hurry.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're worried, aren't you?

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So am I.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's he gonna do?

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll find out in a few minutes...

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart's sinking!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know where he's gone, don't you?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's betting everything he's got.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way I did...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And won.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Wali?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray he plays his move and wipes the floor with his opponent.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean he's gone to see Maheen?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You are so intelligent!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so simple, Wali.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When Gulrez's type bet everything,

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They play a gamble where the first move is the only one that's legal.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to you later...

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got to pray for now...

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's with the panting?

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No --

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had to dash...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Aunt?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt and Maheen ain't here.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to my room.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get you a cuppa. And some kebabs.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No kebabs...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just the cuppa.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She made them!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Really?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta try 'em, I guess!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where were you all these days?

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Where were you?</i>

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me or her?

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was no good, really.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My paying a visit won't change nothin' here.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if my paying a visit would.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which bowler thinks if he's got the wicket before throwing the ball?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just throw the ball, mun!

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I'm here.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna bowl a yorker

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That'll take the wicket!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're suckin' diesel, man!

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope... She won't mind it?

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you worried about that?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't...

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just remembered... She breaks stuff in her fury...

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She does, aye.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why we never leave any vases in her room!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scared yet?

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No vases...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No fear.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I call her? I'm sure I can tell her everything.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can say it,

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she can't know your feelings!

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought about that...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It looks a bit... Shameless, to be honest...

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I think... I'd seize her hand and pull her into a corner...

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told you it looks shameless?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize her hand, pull her into a corner, and say...

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought anything?
-What?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you gonna tell her?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're underestimating me... I've thought of the finest things to say!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then stay here! She'll be back in two hours!

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two hours?

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gone shopping. It's Jiya's birthday.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good...

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you go to college?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one class today.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd skive off.

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Very bad.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Aunt?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At Nano's.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You scared of her too?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, it's just --

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I seized her hand...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die of shame if Aunt saw me!

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know anything, do you?

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt would be delighted to see it!

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's waiting for you to play your move!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's your kebabs!

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you show me that one?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This one, ma'am?
-No, the other one.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
5,500.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't care. Pack it.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And this orange one!

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me...

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, sir?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much for this one?

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's sold out. Except the blue one.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, I want the orange one.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just bought it.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not yet, she didn't.

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost thought it's your doppelgänger.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you've bought it, okay, I'll get something else.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or sell it

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To whoever you want.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
5,500?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Excuse me!

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanted to tell you something.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say sorry for the slap.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it's okay quick or they'll think there's something going on between us!

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've asked the cook to have dinner ready by 1.30.

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No... I think I'll pass.

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But she won't.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she wants lunch ready by 1.30!

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way,

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why won't you have anything?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say, fill yourself up before she gets here.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Eat like an SIL eats at his in-laws.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your horses, Fajr.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean it.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Any opportunity could be your last, Gulrez!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As they say in the Army...

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You can get in, but there's no getting out'!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where'd you learn that?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It doesn't suit you!

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, you're just a wee girl!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please, Gulrez,

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't all that wee!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see a man's face

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I know what's on his mind.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Every wee girl grows up fast

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks to the cads.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A couple of 'em have asked for my number too. For real!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Fajr...!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Swear to me...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1.30... Or 2.30...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ain't leavin' before talkin' to her!

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're all wasting ourselves,

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Grieving for you, but you!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't seem to care!

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, gather some courage, mun!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a lot of courage. And when the time comes, you'll see it!

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, guess what, the time's come. But it'll go after 1.30.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean... Hide somewhere in the lobby as soon as it's 1.30.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, mun...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be back at 1.30, Sherlock!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment she sets foot here,

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize her hand and pull her into a corner!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get it now, mate...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The name's Fajr!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okie doke, Fajr...

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wait for 1.30...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's like the brave man you are!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd come shopping. Jiya's throwing a party tonight. It's her birthday.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That wastes my shopping.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't be caught dead there. Not with you around!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's your friend! Your best buddy!

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, enjoy the coffee... I'm paying.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can pay for my cup, thank you!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, honestly...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you just angry over the slap or do you actually hate me?

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got no idea

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it's just a bit of anger or if I actually hate you.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you come here for coffee then?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You asked me.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said you'd say sorry.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It felt kinda nice.

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry...

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say that you're ashamed...

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you shouldn't have slapped me.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Colonel would've thrown us in the nick if I didn't slap you!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still...

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You shouldn't have slapped me.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, I shouldn't have. Fine?

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What 'hmm'?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it's okay!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be the Chief

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As long as I live.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long will that be?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, Madame...

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't here for long.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd leave as soon as you get married...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I get married?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pretty soon, yeah.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't act like you don't know it.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor old Gulrez is dying for you.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And aye,

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I saw him running...

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he was going to see you.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Said he'd give the news in 10 minutes.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Running?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wasn't he in his Foxy?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter's in for it.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For loving you?

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what the mannies say in London?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say you better not let her know you've fallen for her,

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or she'd kill you off where you won't have an ounce of relief.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He sent you?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon mate, I was just shopping when I happened to see you!

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Aren't you serious about Gulrez?

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is there someone else?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Waqar...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just askin' as a friend!

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd we become friends?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout just now? Not a big deal!

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...?

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your hand's gone a bridge too far.

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind your hand, Waqar...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're all watching!

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Since you've brought it up... Mind if I say something?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't find someone like Gulrez.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd die for you.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She here?

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. It's 1.35.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hide in the lobby! She'd be on her way!

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, yes.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And hey...

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take care of everything else.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You would?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll face it all.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come what may!

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Maheen?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Gulrez get there?

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's right here. Just had lunch.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Mum?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At Nano's.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When'd he get there?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something special?

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Definitely.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's waiting for you.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said he's here to see you.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He seems serious this time!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And - I mean it - very brave!

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brave?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, like a bowler

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who takes a good look at the ball before throwing it?

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Determined to claim a wicket this time?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what he looks like.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He even told me, 'You underestimate me, Fajr'!

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's he?

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the lobby.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wherever he is, he's waiting for you.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him to come over to Nano's.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's where I'm headed.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, mate...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You made me jump.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing here?

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1.45!

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm waiting!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need now.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's waiting for you now.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's work on plan B.

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plan B?

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about plan A?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gone over to Nano's.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't coming here.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, sit down.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You came here to do something, yes?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just told you.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then remember...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get this chance again.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What chance?

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you're determined to strike when the iron's hot,

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's do

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or die!

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Over to Nano's now?

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So intelligent!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll seize her hand before everyone,

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And pull her into a corner!

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna remember that the next time someone says, 'Gulrez hasn't got the guts'!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I say that...

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't that brave.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can strike from the lobby.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not over there.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you for the lunch.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was very nice.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does she know I'm here?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who told her?

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you tell her how long I've been waiting?

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She still went to Nano's?

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, mate! You and your questions!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just tell you?

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't a question, mate.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just... Reflecting on it... And her...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm trying to guess

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd happen if I struck

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the iron's hot.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear...

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd burn me...

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said sorry...

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that he shouldn't have slapped me.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then took me out for coffee,

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And extended a hand, saying,

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Let's be friends'!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said, 'back off'.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, 'No way we're making friends'...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Spiffing, m'girl.

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Making friends with the enemy amounts to surrender.

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows you better than me?

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You fight

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To win.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he wants to make friends,

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the problem, Ammi Begum?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The wretch's a proper London tramp.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows what he means by 'friendship'!

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If he extends his hand again,

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him have a taste of yours!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You live for the sound of his name, Ammi Begum.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when he wants to make friends with her, he suddenly becomes your enemy!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it, Mehrunnisa.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not a kid.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know him inside out.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's right.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The London tramp

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is friends with God-knows how many girls.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think he's the type.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way Mashood Ahmed's son is that type.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't pronounce a judgement just yet.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upbringing changes people.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's guessing anything here.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just reading what he said.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not long ago, he was telling Gulrez here...

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Tales of love aren't heard of'

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Outside India and Pakistan'.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'In London',

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'We have'

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Friendships"'...

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was telling Gulrez a lot about his 'friendships'.

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor lad left begging forgiveness!

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That what he's like?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I tell you,

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This lad's gonna trouble Mashood's soul... Not give it some peace...

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say that, Ammi Begum...

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have to look far.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On his way back from London --

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's her name?

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your friend, you know?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya?

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, her.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He brought her along.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hear they talk on the phone for hours.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sees her in private too.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His injured arm...

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who d'you think he went to see in that state?

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That blasted lassie, of course.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Nano.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't the type.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They just met on the plane

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And became friends at my mention.

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm 75 now, girl...

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see right through a girl 75 feet away.

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to us?

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether Jiya's that type or not...

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God keep her happy.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's her birthday today.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it?

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday to her.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You going?

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't you go shopping for her party?

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop speaking in English, for the love of the Lord!

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course,

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't you going, love?

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because <i>he</i>'s going!</i>

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfect.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let him go all alone, the blighted London tramp...

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>In the tale of love where do these turns come from...</i>

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your 25,000!

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't want a penny of it!

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Foxy is parked on our porch.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come and get it.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does she know I'm here?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She still went to Nano's?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jesus, mate! You and your questions!

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just tell you?

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't I just tell you?
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart...</i>

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart...</i>

489
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,537
'Alone on the abode of the Chosen,'

490
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:50,977
'As I was breathing my last,'

491
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,578
'With the memories of days past by my side,'

492
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:58,430
'As I was charting out the map of my life,'

493
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,457
'I was thinking...'

494
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:02,860
'For the sake of this life I have'

495
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,168
'Been through many hardships;'

496
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:07,398
'Endured many wounds inflicted on me'

497
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:10,279
'Battled many sorrows...'

498
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,818
'In exchange for this life,'

499
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,459
'Death used to scare me...'

500
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:18,350
'And my mother, credulous and naïve,'

501
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:21,410
'Would get affrighted...'

502
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,529
'A drop of dolour pinched me then,'

503
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,631
'A scratch darned a cleft then,'

504
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:30,052
'And said to me, Be quiet!'

505
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:33,103
'Every woe shall be auctioned;'

506
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:35,824
'Every scuff shall be chaffered;'

507
00:28:35,824 --> 00:28:38,075
'For all the gloom you will brave,'

508
00:28:38,075 --> 00:28:40,626
'For all the gashes you will take,'

509
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,896
'You shall be recompensed in full.'

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You wrote that?
-Not fair, Neelam.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you steal it?

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit! I didn't steal it!

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've just been reading... And... God, it's so sweet!

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you read it to her?

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?
-Maheen.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, she'd be dying for your love.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd rather laugh it off.

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd say, 'Never thought the numbskull mime could rhyme'!

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to see her.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa!

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I almost gathered the courage to talk to her.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was afraid, but swore I'd tell her everything.

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good! Did you tell her?

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell who?

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ran off to her Nano's

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The moment she found out I'd come to her place.

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You could've gone to Nano's!

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love her.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll face her. But never tail her!

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what,

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love and poetry

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speak to the heart.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To someone so uninterested... Best to pocket the poetry part and lock the words in your heart.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't she shining so bright?

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you go with the driver and give it to Jiya?

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she asks about me... Just say -- I couldn't come.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she asked why?

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her you don't know.

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And if she asks why my phone's switched off, tell her -- The situation forced me...

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not going to Jiya's birthday party.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to go there.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uhh...

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Change of plans.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You guys enjoying here?

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some juice. Please.

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be right back, okay?

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you?

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday, Jiya.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry I couldn't be there.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Sorry' my foot!

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get here right now or I'm comin' to get you!

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop it, mate... What about the guests?

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't come. There. That's it.

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal, mate. Easy.

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, big deal. Go on.

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll say the same. I can't come.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, enjoy the party. And save some cake for me. I'll have it tomorrow.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know me.

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no party without you!

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send everyone back.

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What? You crazy?

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Maheen there?

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. So?

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, your best friend's there. What else d'you want?

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm giving you 30 minutes. If you don't come, I'm sending your Maheen back.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No birthday. No celebration.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
30 minutes or?

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi! How are you, Sania?

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday!

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you so much!

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your time starts...

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your time starts... Now!

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahoy, matey!

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're here?

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just called Waqar.

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean --

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He promised me he'd be here.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll be here.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll wait for 30 minutes.

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww, thank you!

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good for Maheen, though.

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She went to Nano's from the mall.

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or Gulrez's courage would be lying dead here.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know it, Mum, but he was gasping for breath as he got closer to his moment!

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was having cold sweats too.

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stammering too.

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when he found out

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's gone over to Ammi Begum's? What'd he say?

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He ought to go there and say it for all to hear!

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Impossible.

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what he said.

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorta. Impossible.

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The utter poltroon.

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For a moment, I felt

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not one.

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just...

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fears her rejection.

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just toying with him.

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
