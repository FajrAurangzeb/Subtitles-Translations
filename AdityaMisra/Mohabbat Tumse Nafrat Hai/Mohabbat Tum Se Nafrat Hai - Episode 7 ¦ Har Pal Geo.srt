1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, of course.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So soon?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I look lovely, don't I?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about the birthday?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still celebrating...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe done by now.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... Here!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm starving!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Maheen.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened there?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you back?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I do?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He</i> was there.</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem with him?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm thinking.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's my problem?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do know there's something...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sight of him...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gives me the creeps!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hid the moment I saw him. And the moment Jiya saw him...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came back sharpish.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mmm!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's Gulrez.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He fears her.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then there's her.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She fears Waqar.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's lying.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't fear anyone.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jiya!</i>

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That wastes my shopping.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't be caught dead there. Not with you around!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm okay, thanks.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no party without you!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send everyone back.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm giving you 30 minutes. If you don't come, I'm sending your Maheen back.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pity her, Gulrez.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's back on the road, don't think she won't stop again.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just a bit jealous, aren't you?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse the one who'd be jealous of your love for your Foxy.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say what you want to, Wali Ahmed.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just furious at your own car

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To see the Foxy go full steam ahead!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm furious at you.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how far we've gone?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You loved long drives?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not in a donkey cart!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's jealous!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If this bugger stops again, it'll be your loss!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Loss?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My foot.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to ask what's your loss?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam's going to her place.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to Maheen's.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to sort everything out.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you stop the car?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you talk to her?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you never will!

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My fault.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take the punishment.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't take any help

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my battles.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to talk to her yesterday.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I couldn't, it doesn't mean I wouldn't.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One day.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I give you two days.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last and final.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you couldn't, you will let me handle it my way.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two days?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want some more?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, mate?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's quite a lot, frankly.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 10! Where are you folks?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's still sleeping.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's growing old...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Just angry.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She likes to sleep on her anger.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea why we depend on such a good-for-nothing to live our lives.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it. She's our Chief.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd decided to do as the Chief says.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To get angry or sleep on it...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's her choice!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So no cricket today?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're playing.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one player less. It happens.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call Gulrez.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't she coming?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's sleeping.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at the time.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're playing without her.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's a good game without her?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The London tramp's gonna knock us for six!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been practicing since daybreak, the blighter!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Practicing?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Gulrez...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do something to rouse that twit.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I told you we're playing today.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing with the newspaper?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heavens...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put that down, Munshi Alam!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- Get to the ground.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
15 minutes. Skim through the headlines.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read the rest after we've lost.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're okaying as if you're sure we've lost this.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Ali, Gulrez!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you, matey?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you run off last night?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even tell me!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had to. <i>He</i> got there!</i>

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't coming.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got him to come.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd make peace.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've made peace.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said sorry.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You secret squirrels!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't even tell me!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just did.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was just yesterday.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel good?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Making peace, making friends...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Friends?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not worth it!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again, matey...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't really know, do you?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want to discuss him.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you just want to discuss him.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call me to say that load of guff?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear not...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't accept Gulrez's proposal yet...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I thought you've got something going on...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not until after Doomsday!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with that arrogance and someone else will get her hands on him!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The handsome twit...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lovely twit...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The mellifluous twit...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you get your hands on him? He even listens to your earfuls!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean it?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said it.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant it.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's all yours, for all I care.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme know if you get your hands on him. We'll celebrate together!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Nano!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you. Nano's calling...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Gulrez!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ugh!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez! Maheen!
-Good show!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go for a four!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you say 'six'?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever seen him hit one?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides,

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He</i>'s bowling!</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which namby-pamby sissy's got the guts?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Play the ball...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one wicket down!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Nano.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not this time.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close, aye...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely, Dado...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You turned away the moment the ball touched the wicket!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't help it...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't see it.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never thought our umpire's gonna be so biased.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I be biased against you?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I were, I could just ask Maheen, you know.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute, Nano!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who swings up towards the air to hit a four?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought a six would delight you.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A four will do just as well...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you can actually <i>hit one</i>!</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at that?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're seeing each other at last!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hit a four.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see, Cap'n.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out!
-Yeah!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo hoo!

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wicket?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wicket.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was a ball for a six. But you told me to go for a four.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You couldn't hit anything but a six on it!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bowling's easy.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, I know.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easier than yours!

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon already!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be furious at him!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well played, mate.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one wicket down... Blimey...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali... Take it easy, okay?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No hurries, okay?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better save our honour!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good...

253
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:26,618
ADD

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
