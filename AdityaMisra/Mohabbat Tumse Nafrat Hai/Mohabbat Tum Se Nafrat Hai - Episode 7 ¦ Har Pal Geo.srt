1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could it be?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen, of course.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So soon?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I look lovely, don't I?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about the birthday?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Still celebrating...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe done by now.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... Here!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm starving!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Maheen.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened there?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you back?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I do?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He was there.</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's your problem with him?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I'm thinking.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's my problem?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do know there's something...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sight of him...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gives me the creeps!

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hid the moment I saw him. And the moment Jiya saw him...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I came back sharpish.

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mmm!

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely!

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's Gulrez.

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He fears her.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then there's her.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She fears Waqar.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's lying.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She doesn't fear anyone.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jiya!</i>

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That wastes my shopping.

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't be caught dead there. Not with you around!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm okay, thanks.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no party without you!

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll send everyone back.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm giving you 30 minutes. If you don't come, I'm sending your Maheen back.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pity her, Gulrez.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's back on the road, don't think she won't stop again.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just a bit jealous, aren't you?

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse the one who'd be jealous of your love for your Foxy.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say what you want to, Wali Ahmed.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just furious at your own car

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To see the Foxy go full steam ahead!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm furious at you.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how far we've gone?

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You loved long drives?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not in a donkey cart!

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's jealous!

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quickly...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If this bugger stops again, it'll be your loss!

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Loss?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My foot.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Care to ask what's your loss?

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go on.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam's going to her place.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose?

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to Maheen's.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to sort everything out.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you stop the car?

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you talk to her?

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because you never will!

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My fault.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take the punishment.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't take any help

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In my battles.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I went to talk to her yesterday.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I couldn't, it doesn't mean I wouldn't.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One day.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I give you two days.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Last and final.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you couldn't, you will let me handle it my way.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two days?

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Want some more?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, mate?

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's quite a lot, frankly.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's 10! Where are you folks?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's still sleeping.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's growing old...

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Just angry.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She likes to sleep on her anger.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea why we depend on such a good-for-nothing to live our lives.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it. She's our Chief.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'd decided to do as the Chief says.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To get angry or sleep on it...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's her choice!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So no cricket today?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're playing.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just one player less. It happens.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll call Gulrez.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't she coming?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's sleeping.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at the time.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're playing without her.

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's a good game without her?

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The London tramp's gonna knock us for six!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been practicing since daybreak, the blighter!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Practicing?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call Gulrez...

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do something to rouse that twit.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I told you we're playing today.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing with the newspaper?

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heavens...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put that down, Munshi Alam!

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And -- Get to the ground.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you say.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
15 minutes. Skim through the headlines.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Read the rest after we've lost.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bless you.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're okaying as if you're sure we've lost this.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Ali, Gulrez!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you, matey?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fine...

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you run off last night?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't even tell me!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Had to. He got there!</i>

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He wasn't coming.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got him to come.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought you'd make peace.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We've made peace.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said sorry.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You secret squirrels!

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Didn't even tell me!

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just did.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It was just yesterday.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel good?

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Making peace, making friends...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Friends?

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not worth it!

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think again, matey...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't really know, do you?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't even want to discuss him.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you just want to discuss him.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call me to say that load of guff?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear not...

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't accept Gulrez's proposal yet...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I thought you've got something going on...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not until after Doomsday!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with that arrogance and someone else will get her hands on him!

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit...

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The handsome twit...

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The lovely twit...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The mellifluous twit...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you get your hands on him? He even listens to your earfuls!

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean it?

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said it.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I meant it.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's all yours, for all I care.

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme know if you get your hands on him. We'll celebrate together!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Nano!

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you. Nano's calling...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, Gulrez!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ugh!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ow!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close!

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez! Maheen!
-Good show!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go for a four!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can't you say 'six'?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever seen him hit one?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Besides,

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He's bowling!</i>

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Which namby-pamby sissy's got the guts?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Play the ball...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one wicket down!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Nano.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not this time.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Close, aye...

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely, Dado...

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's this?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You turned away the moment the ball touched the wicket!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't help it...

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Couldn't see it.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never thought our umpire's gonna be so biased.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I be biased against you?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I were, I could just ask Maheen, you know.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute, Nano!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who swings up towards the air to hit a four?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought a six would delight you.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A four will do just as well...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>If you can actually hit one!</i>

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya...

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would you look at that?

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're seeing each other at last!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hit a four.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll see, Cap'n.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out!
-Yeah!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Woo hoo!

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wicket?

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wicket.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That was a ball for a six. But you told me to go for a four.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You couldn't hit anything but a six on it!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But don't worry.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bowling's easy.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, I know.

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Easier than yours!

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon already!

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be furious at him!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well played, mate.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one wicket down... Blimey...

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali... Take it easy, okay?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No hurries, okay?

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better save our honour!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Run!

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good!

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEAH!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEEHAW!

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whew!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Four!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah!

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good!
-Lovely!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good show!

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For you.

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not now!

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it, m'boy...

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or she'll hit another four.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who is it?

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya.

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Jiya, love...

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor girl must be dying to hear from you.

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't want to talk to her!

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to the game...

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let her score another four...

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon...

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOO HOO!

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now's your chance! She's out too!

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She -- Out?

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfect chance indeed...

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We lost the match... More or less...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're worried about the match?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to her!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She takes the match more seriously than me...

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd clobber me head with her bat if I talked to her now.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the score?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be left scratching your head.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gee...

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's out for a duck too?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was pulling me up like she's won the blimmin' World Cup!

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry. I'll talk to her...

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're still here?

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Double time!

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
32 runs ain't really a doddle.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't lose hope just yet.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Once Ali's out...

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll only leave <i>him</i>...</i>

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can take care of the rest on my own.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ought to be the one to bowl Waqar out.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you want to get even? He bowled you out!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't <i>you</i> want to get even? He bowled <i>you</i> out too!</i>

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, but...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't settle any scores...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Less talk, more bowling!

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That London tramp deserves to be bowled out by your hand!

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get even.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take the blighter's wicket!

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Battlestations!

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can do it, Gulrez!

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, alright... C'mon...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Gulrez!

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw a short pitch!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yay!

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOO HOO!

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely!

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEAH!

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
WOO HOO!

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
YEE HAW!

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you ask for a short pitch?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was cheating...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wanted to trick him.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd told Gulrez to bowl a yorker when I say short pitch!

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow, someone's getting very clever!

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, next!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright...

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Double time!

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good show, Gulrez!

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got a point.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you gonna plan for seven hours to save seven runs?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just send a good bowler.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Save your victory.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or... Consider the match lost.

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Let 'em...)

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What was that?

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm bowling this time.

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you guarantee

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't let them score seven runs?

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can try.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't guarantee that.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, then, stay outside the pitch!

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, Waqar!
-Seven runs!

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just seven runs! Just seven!

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, seven runs!

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Next.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep at it for the next five balls and we've got this!

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I told you not to come here.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not here to see you.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got some gifts

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For your birthday.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here to give you these.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take them and I'll leave.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My birthday's long gone.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't need any gifts now.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, leave.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, love...

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just take these...

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And throw them in the trash if you want...

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Don't kick me out like that...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll regret it one day

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like I regret today.

378
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,328
You

379
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:52,868
You wait

380
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:53,408
You wait and

381
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:53,998
You wait and watch,

382
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:54,250
You wait and watch, Mir

383
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,560
You wait and watch, Mir Mehtab

384
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,688
You wait and watch, Mir Mehtab Ahmed...

385
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,238
I won't regret it one bit.

386
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,538
I'll settle the scores with everyone who's guilty.

387
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,898
I settled a few scores too.

388
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:07,808
That's what I regret today.

389
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,798
Because settling scores

390
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,739
Only suits God.

391
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,900
Not me, not you, not anyone.

392
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,801
Shugufta!

393
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,262
Take these gifts

394
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:23,282
And throw them in the trash!

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, if you'll excuse me...

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Move it!

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, c'mon!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone seems too scared...!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Way to go, Maheen! He fears you!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just get in the car for a minute.

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, Jiya, they're all in the lawn! You want to create a scene?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You getting in or do I need to go in?
-Hey!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Abducting you!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Move it already!

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the meaning of this?

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's only fair!

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We won the match!

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We didn't?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We didn't.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone go call him.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows where he's gone!

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bet they're all thinking I've run off with you.

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We were playing for 10 blasted gee and just one ball away from victory! My honour was at stake!

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see that, but...

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you playing?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told you we had a match today.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You two make quite a match...!

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We do?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt, Ali, Fajr and all the rest are playing!

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's really between the two of you, no?

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All I need to know, folks,

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is where he left for in such a hurry.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, he doesn't know any sorcery or some such thing

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he'd cast a spell and vanish into thin air.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just a minute later,

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam went after him...

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the knockoff wizard wasn't around anywhere!

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bet he's scared of Maheen.

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you see Maheen's bowling?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd take an Alec James Stewart to face her!

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Brendon McCullum, more like.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye,

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd I forget him?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I always heard of him as a player...

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until...

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That knockoff wizard showed up on the pitch

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And vanished!

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, he didn't vanish.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd just run back to the dressing room.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what about <i>him</i>?</i>

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where could he have gone?

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gorblimey

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For having this most queer thought...

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how long

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the blasted flight to London?

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seven hours.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got to the airport

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In two hours

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And got on the plane...

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd call you in about ten hours

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say, 'Something came up. Had to dash to London'.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say something?

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What're you gawpin' at?

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea, Nano...

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I respect him a lot.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't speak English!

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's okay...

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's forgiven for this one mistake...

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But still...

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He spelt doom for your victory as he left.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say something in your anger!

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, go on.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Technically, we've won the match.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can read the ICC's rules if you want.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit, Wali?

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now...

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Bakhshi?

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What can he tell you?

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That ne'er-do-well doesn't know a thing about cricket.

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here you go.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you like it?

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like what?

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Snatching you away.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way, mate.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... It was quite the match.

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now I'm pretty sure they're thinking there's something going on between us.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Isn't there?

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ehh?

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's nothing between us?

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya...

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're joking, right?

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not serious, are you?

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very serious, Waqar.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Bakhshi!

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye?
-Here...

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here.

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ma'am.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you say to Waqar Ahmed?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed?

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, the one you whispered something to?

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you tell him?

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, him.

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mlle. Jiya rang up the intercom

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And said she's outside.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She asked me to tell Waqar

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That if he didn't come out in two minutes,

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's coming in

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To drag him along for everyone to see.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it...</i>
