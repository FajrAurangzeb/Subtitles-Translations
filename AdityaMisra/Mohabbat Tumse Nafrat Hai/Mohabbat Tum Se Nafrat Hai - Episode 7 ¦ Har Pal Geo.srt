1
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,462
Who could it be?

2
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:26,265
Maheen, of course.

3
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:27,961
So soon?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,203
Maheen?

5
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,022
I look lovely, don't I?

6
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,079
What about the birthday?

7
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:39,490
Still celebrating...

8
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,254
Maybe done by now.

9
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:44,161
Blimey... Here!

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,018
I'm starving!

11
00:00:46,018 --> 00:00:47,533
Wait, Maheen.

12
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,412
What happened there?

13
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,994
Why are you back?

14
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:54,869
What could I do?

15
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,483
<i>He</i> was there.

16
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:57,791
Waqar?

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,002
Aye.

18
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,499
What's your problem with him?

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,108
That's what I'm thinking.

20
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,697
What's <i>my</i> problem?

21
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:09,971
I don't know, but there is <i>something</i>...

22
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,578
The sight of him...

23
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,487
Gives me the creeps!

24
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:18,728
I hid the moment I saw him. And the moment Jiya saw him...

25
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,884
I came back sharpish.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,850
Mmm!

27
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:25,379
Lovely!

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,541
Whoa...

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,370
What?

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,853
There's Gulrez.

31
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,083
He fears her.

32
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,129
Then there's her.

33
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,115
She fears Waqar.

34
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,462
She's lying.

35
00:01:47,262 --> 00:01:49,443
She doesn't fear anyone.

36
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,370
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you!</i> ♪

37
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:07,450
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you!</i> ♪

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,520
♪ <i>Happy birthday, dear Jiya!</i> ♪

39
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,295
♪ <i>Happy birthday to you!</i> ♪

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,353
That wastes my shopping.

41
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:05,286
How?

42
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,678
I wouldn't be caught dead there. Not with <i>you</i> around!

43
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,459
Waqar!

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,905
Waqar!

45
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,675
I'm okay, thanks.

46
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,260
There's no party without you!

47
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,515
I'll send everyone back.

48
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:24,245
I'm giving you 30 minutes. If you don't come, I'm sending your Maheen back.

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Pity her, Gulrez.

50
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,407
If she's back on the road, don't think she won't stop again.

51
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,863
You're just a bit jealous, aren't you?

52
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,863
Curse the one who'd be jealous of your love for your Foxy.

53
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:04,062
Just say what you want to, Wali Ahmed.

54
00:05:04,123 --> 00:05:06,373
You're just furious at your own car

55
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,748
To see the Foxy go full steam ahead!

56
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:10,454
I'm furious at <i>you</i>.

57
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,640
You know how far we've gone?

58
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,083
I thought

59
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,836
You loved long drives?

60
00:05:15,836 --> 00:05:18,422
Not in a donkey cart!

61
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,512
Someone's jealous!

62
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:24,013
Quickly...

63
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,737
If this bugger stops again, it'll be your loss!

64
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:29,166
Loss?

65
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,821
My foot.

66
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,156
Care to ask what's your loss?

67
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,518
Alright.

68
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,241
Go on.

69
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,827
Neelam's going to her place.

70
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,573
Whose?

71
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,566
Tell him.

72
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,714
I'm going to Maheen's.

73
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,198
I want to sort everything out.

74
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,948
Why'd you stop the car?

75
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,168
Why'd <i>you</i> talk to her?

76
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:08,819
Because <i>you</i> never will!

77
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,498
My fault.

78
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,980
I'll suffer for it.

79
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:17,780
No.

80
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:19,415
Not at all.

81
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,555
I won't take any help

82
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,965
In my battles.

83
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,192
I went to talk to her yesterday.

84
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,611
If I couldn't, it doesn't mean I wouldn't.

85
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,108
I will.

86
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,907
One day.

87
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,548
I give you two days.

88
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,087
Last and final.

89
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,416
If you couldn't, you will let me handle it my way.

90
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,678
Two days?

91
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,335
Want some more?

92
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:53,004
How much?

93
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,333
What are you saying, mate?

94
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,821
It's quite a lot, frankly.

95
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,530
It's 10! Where are you folks?

96
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,428
She's still sleeping.

97
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,719
She's growing old...

98
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,425
No. Just angry.

99
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:41,345
She likes to sleep her anger off.

100
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:46,140
No idea why we depend on such a good-for-nothing to live our lives.

101
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,605
Can it. She's our Chief.

102
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,550
We'd decided to do as the Chief says.

103
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:53,433
To get angry or sleep it off...

104
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,005
It's her choice!

105
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:56,755
So no cricket today?

106
00:09:56,755 --> 00:09:58,060
We're playing.

107
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,166
Just one player less. It happens.

108
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,297
Okay.

109
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,701
I'll call Gulrez.

110
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:06,648
Isn't she coming?

111
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,634
No.

112
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,496
She's sleeping.

113
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,303
Blimey...

114
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,933
Look at the time.

115
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:16,230
Let her.

116
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,379
We're playing without her.

117
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,257
What's a good game without her?

118
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:27,282
The London tramp's gonna knock us for six!

119
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:28,748
D'you know

120
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:32,221
He's been practicing since daybreak, the blighter!

121
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,862
Practicing?

122
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,611
Call Gulrez...

123
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:40,757
I'll do something to rouse that twit.

124
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,314
I thought I told you we're playing today.

125
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,838
What are you doing with the newspaper?

126
00:10:49,928 --> 00:10:51,326
Heavens...

127
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:54,774
Put that down, Munshi Alam!

128
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,002
And -- Get to the ground.

129
00:10:57,002 --> 00:10:58,484
As you say.

130
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,050
15 minutes. Skim through the headlines.

131
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,133
Read the rest after we've lost.

132
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,548
Okay.

133
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,740
Bless you.

134
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,505
You're okaying as if you're sure we've lost this.

135
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,348
It's Ali, Gulrez!

136
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,959
Hello?

137
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,321
Hello.

138
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,795
How are you, matey?

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,578
Fine...

140
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,758
Why'd you run off last night?

141
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:52,049
You didn't even tell me!

142
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,491
Had to. <i>He</i> got there!

143
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,341
He wasn't coming.

144
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,801
I got him to come.

145
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,518
I thought you'd make peace.

146
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:02,972
We've made peace.

147
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,982
He said sorry.

148
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,342
Hey!

149
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:08,713
You secret squirrels!

150
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:10,353
Didn't even tell me!

151
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,653
I just did.

152
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,465
It was just yesterday.

153
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,164
Feel good?

154
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,496
What?

155
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,468
Making peace, making friends...

156
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,567
Friends?

157
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,907
Put a sock in it!

158
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,610
He's not worth it!

159
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,438
Think again, matey...

160
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:27,993
You don't really know, do you?

161
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:30,964
I don't even want to discuss him.

162
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,713
I think you just want to discuss him.

163
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:37,296
Did you call me to say that load of guff?

164
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:39,655
I swear not...

165
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,105
You didn't accept Gulrez's proposal yet...

166
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:45,524
So I thought you've got something going on...

167
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:47,445
Not until after Doomsday!

168
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,005
Get it?

169
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:54,446
Keep up with that arrogance and someone else will get her hands on him!

170
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,828
The twit...

171
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:59,919
The handsome twit...

172
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,768
The lovely twit...

173
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,900
The mellifluous twit...

174
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,018
Why don't you get your hands on him? He even listens to your earfuls!

175
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:10,709
You mean it?

176
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:11,770
I said it.

177
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,319
I meant it.

178
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,580
He's all yours, for all I care.

179
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,259
Lemme know if you get your hands on him. We'll celebrate together!

180
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,930
Maheen!

181
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,609
It's Nano!

182
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:28,404
I'll get back to you. Nano's calling...

183
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:29,378
Bye!

184
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:30,861
Bye.

185
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,928
C'mon!

186
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,509
Gulrez!

187
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,119
Aye, Gulrez!

188
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,899
Ugh!

189
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,528
Ow!

190
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,942
Close!

191
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:45,115
Gulrez! Maheen!
-Good show!

192
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,528
Go for a four!

193
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:53,363
Can't you say 'six'?

194
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:55,404
Ever seen him hit one?

195
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,875
Besides,

196
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,825
<i>He</i>'s bowling!

197
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,825
Who?

198
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,502
Which namby-pamby sissy's got the guts?

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:15:07,028
C'mon.

200
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,168
Show me what you've got!

201
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,529
That's one wicket down!

202
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,778
No, Nano.

203
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:20,029
Not this time.

204
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,249
Close, aye...

205
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,210
Lovely, Dado...

206
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,569
What's this?

207
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,710
What?

208
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,378
You turned away the moment the ball touched the wicket!

209
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,709
Couldn't help it...

210
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,588
Couldn't see it.

211
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,749
Never thought our umpire's gonna be so biased.

212
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,929
What was that?

213
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,869
Why'd I be biased against you?

214
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:49,860
If I were, I could just ask Maheen, you know.

215
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:51,930
Okay.

216
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,382
Okay...

217
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,048
Just a minute, Nano!

218
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,901
Who swings up towards the air to hit a four?

219
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,622
I thought a six would delight you.

220
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,852
A four will do just as well...

221
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,553
If you can <i>actually</i> hit one!

222
00:16:20,253 --> 00:16:21,479
Suraiyya...

223
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,599
Would you look at that?

224
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,441
They're seeing each other at last!

225
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,112
Okay.

226
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:32,334
Alright.

227
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,934
I'll hit a four.

228
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,865
You'll see, Skip.

229
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,459
Out!
-Yeah!

230
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,478
Woo hoo!

231
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,378
Wicket?

232
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,858
Aye.

233
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,549
Wicket.

234
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,108
Aye...

235
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,558
That was a ball for a six. But you told me to go for a four.

236
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:35,179
You couldn't hit anything but a six on it!

237
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,338
Aye.

238
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,294
Thank you.

239
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,525
But don't worry, Cap'n.

240
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,366
The bowling's easy.

241
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:44,315
Aye, I know.

242
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:45,925
Easier than yours!

243
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,641
C'mon already!

244
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:49,923
Don't be furious at him!

245
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,913
Well played, mate.

246
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,058
That's one wicket down... Blimey...

247
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,379
Wali... Take it easy, okay?

248
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:05,473
No hurries, okay?

249
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,304
Maheen!

250
00:18:06,304 --> 00:18:07,583
Wali!

251
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:10,242
You better save our honour!

252
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:12,790
Hey...

253
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,369
Good...

254
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,368
Run!

255
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,709
Good!

256
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,059
YEAH!

257
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,048
YEEHAW!

258
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,668
Whew!

259
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,301
Four!

260
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,788
Yeah!

261
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,120
Good!
-Lovely!

262
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,088
Good show!

263
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,873
Wait.

264
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:13,950
For you.

265
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,471
Not now!

266
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,652
Take it, m'boy...

267
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:19,883
Or she'll hit another four.

268
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,223
So...

269
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:22,367
Who is it?

270
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,853
It's...

271
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,374
Jiya.

272
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,930
It's Jiya, love...

273
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,800
The poor girl must be dying to hear from you.

274
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,078
I don't want to talk to her!

275
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,908
Alright...

276
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:39,108
Back to the game...

277
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:41,210
Let her score another four...

278
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,740
C'mon...

279
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,140
WOO HOO!

280
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,738
Now's your chance! She's out too!

281
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,838
What?

282
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:55,850
She -- Out?

283
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,211
Aye.

284
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:00,631
Perfect chance indeed...

285
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,131
We lost the match... More or less...

286
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,961
You're worried about the match?

287
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,361
So...?

288
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:08,781
Talk to her!

289
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,518
Blimey...

290
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,536
She takes the match more seriously than me...

291
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:16,978
She'd clobber me head with her bat if I talked to her now.

292
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,518
What's the score?

293
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,580
You'd be left scratching your head.

294
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:26,239
Gee...

295
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,750
She's out for a duck too?

296
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,359
She was pulling me up like she's won the blimmin' World Cup!

297
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,158
Don't worry. I'll talk to her...

298
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,428
You're still here?

299
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:22,850
Come!

300
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:24,339
Double time!

301
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,488
Look...

302
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,390
32 runs ain't really a doddle.

303
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:42,479
Don't lose hope just yet.

304
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,448
I won't.

305
00:23:45,071 --> 00:23:47,023
Once Ali's out...

306
00:23:47,089 --> 00:23:49,051
It'll only leave <i>him</i>...

307
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:51,862
I can take care of the rest on my own.

308
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:55,032
You ought to be the one to bowl Waqar out.

309
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:56,472
Why?

310
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:59,682
Don't you want to get even? He bowled you out!

311
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:03,420
Don't <i>you</i> want to get even? He bowled <i>you</i> out too!

312
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,337
Aye, but...

313
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,592
I can't settle any scores...

314
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:09,849
Less talk, more bowling!

315
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:13,676
That London tramp deserves to be bowled out by your hand!

316
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,007
Get even.

317
00:24:18,098 --> 00:24:20,482
Take the blighter's wicket!

318
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,919
Battlestations!

319
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,578
You can do it, Gulrez!

320
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,029
Alright, alright... C'mon...

321
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:49,919
Here.

322
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,622
C'mon, Gulrez!

323
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:54,765
Throw a short pitch!

324
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,521
Yay!

325
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:04,761
WOO HOO!

326
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:05,612
Lovely!

327
00:25:05,612 --> 00:25:06,471
YEAH!

328
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,622
WOO HOO!

329
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,587
YEE HAW!

330
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,919
But you asked for a short pitch!

331
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,438
I was cheating...

332
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:21,069
Wanted to trick him.

333
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:24,490
I'd told Gulrez to bowl a yorker when I say short pitch!

334
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,110
Wow, someone's getting very clever!

335
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,280
Alright, next!

336
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,192
C'mon!

337
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,298
Okay...

338
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,640
Alright...

339
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,379
Here!

340
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,509
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Double time!

341
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,449
Good show, Gulrez!

342
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,600
He's got a point.

343
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,398
Are you gonna plan for seven hours to save seven runs?

344
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:44,978
Just send a good bowler.

345
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,389
Save your victory.

346
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:49,199
Or... Consider the match lost.

347
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,638
(Let 'em...)

348
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,160
What was that?

349
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,038
I'm bowling this time.

350
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:00,739
Whoa...

351
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,078
Can you guarantee

352
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:05,570
You won't let them score seven runs?

353
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,970
I can try.

354
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,980
I can't guarantee that.

355
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,881
Well, then, stay outside the pitch!

356
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,728
C'mon!

357
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,175
C'mon, Waqar!
-Seven runs!

358
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,740
Just seven runs! Just seven!

359
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,511
Aye, seven runs!

360
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,522
Next.

361
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:47,652
C'mon.

362
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:51,893
Keep at it for the next five balls and we've got this!

363
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,921
I told you not to come here.

364
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:15,121
I'm not here to see you.

365
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:17,401
I got some gifts

366
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:19,291
For your birthday.

367
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:21,132
I'm here to give you these.

368
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,417
Take them and I'll leave.

369
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:26,259
My birthday's long gone.

370
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,818
I don't need any gifts now.

371
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,117
Please, leave.

372
00:28:30,117 --> 00:28:31,887
Please, love...

373
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:34,526
Just take these...

374
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:38,648
And throw them in the trash if you want...

375
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:43,379
Just... Don't kick me out like that...

376
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,579
No way.

377
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,919
You'll regret it one day

378
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,128
Like I regret today.

379
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,328
You

380
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:52,868
You wait

381
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:53,408
You wait and

382
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:53,998
You wait and watch,

383
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:54,250
You wait and watch, Mir

384
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,560
You wait and watch, Mir Mehtab

385
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,688
You wait and watch, Mir Mehtab Ahmed...

386
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,238
I won't regret it one bit.

387
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,538
I'll settle the scores with everyone who's guilty.

388
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:04,898
I settled a few scores too.

389
00:29:05,468 --> 00:29:07,808
That's what I regret today.

390
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,798
Because settling scores

391
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:13,739
Only suits God.

392
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,900
Not me, not you, not anyone.

393
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,801
Shugufta!

394
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,262
Take these gifts

395
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:23,282
And throw them in the trash!

396
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,748
Now, if you'll excuse me...

397
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,068
Move it!

398
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:38,610
C'mon, c'mon!

399
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,089
Yes!

400
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,719
Someone seems too scared...!

401
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:54,229
Way to go, Maheen! He fears you!

402
00:30:56,789 --> 00:30:58,090
Why are you here?

403
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,809
Just get in the car for a minute.

404
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:02,250
No way, Jiya, they're all in the lawn! You want to create a scene?

405
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:05,562
You getting in or do I need to go in?
-Hey!

406
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,631
Just... Abducting you!

407
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,881
C'mon!

408
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,578
Move it already!

409
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,030
What's the meaning of this?

410
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,271
It's only fair!

411
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:19,457
So...

412
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,712
We won the match!

413
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,218
We didn't?

414
00:31:28,268 --> 00:31:29,570
We didn't.

415
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,669
Someone go call him.

416
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:34,004
Who knows where he's gone!

417
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,141
Bet they're all thinking I've run off with you.

418
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:58,602
We were playing for 10 blasted gee and just one ball away from victory! My honour was at stake!

419
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:01,132
I can see that, but...

420
00:32:01,192 --> 00:32:03,162
Who are you playing?

421
00:32:03,402 --> 00:32:04,861
Maheen.

422
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:07,012
Told you we had a match today.

423
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,902
You two make quite a match...!

424
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:11,212
We do?

425
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,000
Aunt, Ali, Fajr and all the rest are playing!

426
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,898
But it's really between the two of you, no?

427
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,111
All I need to know, folks,

428
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:30,962
Is where he left for in such a hurry.

429
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,163
Surely, he doesn't know any sorcery or some such thing

430
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,318
That he'd cast a spell and vanish into thin air.

431
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,778
I mean, just a minute later,

432
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:44,080
Munshi Alam went after him...

433
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,929
But the knockoff wizard wasn't around anywhere!

434
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:49,572
Bet he's scared of Maheen.

435
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:54,309
Did you see Maheen's bowling?

436
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:58,284
It'd take an Alec James Stewart to face her!

437
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,701
Brendon McCullum, more like.

438
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,242
Aye,

439
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:06,522
How'd I forget him?

440
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,862
I always heard of him as a player...

441
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:11,562
Until...

442
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:14,696
That knockoff wizard showed up on the pitch

443
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,503
And vanished!

444
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:18,514
Oh, he didn't vanish.

445
00:33:18,624 --> 00:33:21,987
He'd just run back to the dressing room.

446
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:23,876
But what about <i>him</i>?

447
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,947
Where could he have gone?

448
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:27,947
Gorblimey

449
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:31,106
For having this most queer thought...

450
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:33,089
But how long

451
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:37,022
Is the blasted flight to London?

452
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,893
Seven hours.

453
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:44,401
He got to the airport

454
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:47,251
In two hours

455
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,118
And got on the plane...

456
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,838
What d'you mean?

457
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,918
I mean

458
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,722
He'd call you in about ten hours

459
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:05,079
And say, 'Something came up. Had to dash to London'.

460
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,888
Why don't you say something?

461
00:34:11,923 --> 00:34:15,368
What're you gawpin' at?

462
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,358
No idea, Nano...

463
00:34:17,498 --> 00:34:19,968
I respect him a lot.

464
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:22,880
Don't speak English!

465
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,629
It's okay...

466
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:27,999
He's forgiven for this one mistake...

467
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,039
But still...

468
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,402
He spelt doom for your victory as he left.

469
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,308
Just say something in your anger!

470
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,049
May I?

471
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,698
Aye, go on.

472
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:53,818
Technically, we've won the match.

473
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,653
You can read the ICC's rules if you want.

474
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:00,333
Innit, Wali?

475
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,981
There, now...

476
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,208
Where's Bakhshi?

477
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,701
What can he tell you?

478
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:12,590
That ne'er-do-well doesn't know a thing about cricket.

479
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,118
Here you go.

480
00:35:44,118 --> 00:35:45,500
Thanks.

481
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,908
Don't you like it?

482
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:54,798
What?

483
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:56,359
Like what?

484
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,508
Snatching you away.

485
00:35:58,508 --> 00:35:59,429
No way, mate.

486
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:01,320
Just... It was quite the match.

487
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,290
Now I'm pretty sure they're thinking there's something going on between us.

488
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,170
Isn't there?

489
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,814
Ehh?

490
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,501
There's nothing between us?

491
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:15,608
Jiya...

492
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,023
You're joking, right?

493
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:20,648
You're not serious, are you?

494
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:23,723
I'm very serious, Waqar.

495
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,198
Uncle Bakhshi!

496
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:29,828
Aye?
-Here...

497
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:30,720
Come here.

498
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,941
Ma'am.

499
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,112
What'd you say to Waqar Ahmed?

500
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,762
Waqar Ahmed?

501
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:40,293
You know, the one you whispered something to?

502
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,983
What'd you tell him?

503
00:36:41,983 --> 00:36:43,042
Ah, him.

504
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,383
Mlle Jiya rang up the intercom

505
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:47,665
And said she's outside.

506
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,914
She asked me to tell Waqar

507
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,045
That if he didn't come out in two minutes,

508
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,560
She's coming in

509
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,478
To drag him along for everyone to see.
