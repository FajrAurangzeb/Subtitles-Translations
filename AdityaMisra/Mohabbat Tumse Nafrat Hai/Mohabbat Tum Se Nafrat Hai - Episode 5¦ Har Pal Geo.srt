1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're lucky.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You almost got pulverised.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your fracture's minor. Mercifully.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll be fine in a few days.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Naw, boyo...

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just got your deserts.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel like acting another fracture out?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think of playing cricket for a few days.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pressure on those two stitches ain't gonna be pleasant.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, just lovely...

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... Who's driving?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me, of course.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't use your right hand.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May I?

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, take care.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Course.

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...
-Hmm?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fear God.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're the type who gets punished instantly.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, Reverend.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God be with ye.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's switched off...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you so worried about?

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He left without a word.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, his phone's switched off...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Crucified me... More or less...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not a kid.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's havin' a ball.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd have to wear that bandage 'round here.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm gonna take it off for everyone to see and blooter him proper.

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you won't blooter him.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're just saying it for Maheen to hear.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Promise me, Nano...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You got to blooter him if he's actually lying!

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, can it... D'you seriously think it'd look good? Me blootering that 6-foot lad?

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Would he look nice, getting himself beaten?</i>

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Paper tigers don't look too good either.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He deserves a proper slap... At least...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forget it... Your slap won't even scratch him.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Allow me. I'll smite him proper and knock some sense into him!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Heavens...

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you been waiting for four years to do that? Hold your horses...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye... But one day...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get even.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta say...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's some big words from the wee girl.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just bring him here.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll give him a taste of what he deserves.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez! M'boy!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How are you?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's she?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard she got hurt.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She bumped into Waqar and fell.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's just a scratch.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's she?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In Ammi Begum's room.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Uncle.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remembered your Uncle, eh?

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a new car for you, you twit.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you! You were sleeping in your Foxy's arms.

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever gonna change?

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never, Uncle.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can see that.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's Gulrez!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Upon you too. How are you?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Great.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, please.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your fiancée gave you the finger. Called off the engagement. How's that for great?

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So what?

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's only called off for now...

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just playing with you.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know it.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll say in a few days...

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Alright'...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Gulrez ain't a bad choice at all'!

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam ain't here?

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She's gone to the shrine with Wali.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shrine?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd light a lamp.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Make a wish.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa!

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's her wish?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm!

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pretty sure it's Maheen's acceptance,

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For which she'd make regular offerings at the shrine, innit?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go check on her.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No way...

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you here, then?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I came here for.

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I don't dare...

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep up with that,

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she'd trample you under her feet!

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not the type!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She just thinks...

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've attacked her with this engagement thing.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's just a bit angry.

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You siding with her, you twit?

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not her, Aunt.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm siding with the truth.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got flowers?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gorblimey. Nothing for the sick!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blasted Scrooge!

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>To think he wants to get engaged to me.</i>

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haven't you brought flowers or something?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Flowers?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just... Came knocking?

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why're you pulling him up, Dastoor?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Suraiyya...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's visiting the sick.

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His fiancée, no less! Couldn't the Scrooge spend a penny?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tea.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get flowers first.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was so frightened

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I forgot I had to bring flowers.

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing much... Just got hurt...

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh God...

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Looks serious.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But just a bit.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's okay. No problem.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back.

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta get some flowers.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you. We'll have a nice chat.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll be back in... 15 minutes?

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How's your arm?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Two stitches on the elbow.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey... Two stitches... As if the fracture wasn't enough.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nah,

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he just forgot to mention it.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to Ammi Begum. Quick.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's looking for you.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Course.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm going to see her.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here!

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he brought flowers?

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not the flowery bloke.

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The dramatic one!

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah...

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi, everybody!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Likewise...

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here, m'lad.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit by me.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you up to?

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard your elbow's pulverised.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yet you're going about the city, driving with one hand!

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I haven't seen another one like you. Not in the family at least.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado... What it is is...

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, what?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't pulverised or something...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Broken...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you lookin' at?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you want them to look at, of course.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's those pills for?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard about your broken arm.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never any wound.

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing, Dado...

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Two stitches.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One bump and you fell apart...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show me!
-Hey!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing?

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll open it and chant an incantation for you...

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't need the plaster, the bandages,

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the pills!
-OW!

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It hurts real bad!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's real bad, Waqar Ahmed...

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been busted!

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness! It kills me...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M'boy -- Dastoor Ahmed!

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come here!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Goodness...

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Relax, Dado...

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado! Calm down!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado! Hey!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Help her!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor! Dado!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened, Dado? Easy...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor!

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor! What happened to Dado?

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blood?

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum!

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum! Lemme --

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she heard about the engagement, she was drained of all cheer.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Almost felt like... She'd refuse...

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said she needed some time to think...

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm at a dead end, so to speak...

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows how long she needs...

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Three stitches.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's gonna take a while now.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All thanks to you, you blighter!

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told me he was just putting up an act!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he?

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell you?

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was, to begin with!

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, put a sock in it!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your little jokes cost my lad

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A quarter gallon of his blood.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
M'boy...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Three stitches.

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to mention the pain that refuses to go away.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it to me?

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing, I know.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But the least you could do is check on him.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can it!

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fear the Lord, Maheen!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's three stitches and an armache to a man?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls shouldn't be so heartless!

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone's switching sides!

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone else is too, innit?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sight of his blood

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nearly killed you too!

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Not his blood! Just the sight of blood!</i>

257
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,979
The name's Maheen Aurangzeb.

258
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:08,098
They hate how I hate 'em!

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you crying?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something you're afraid of?

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she came here with her prayers?

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know what happens when prayers clash.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose prayers get heard?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The prayers of those who love truly.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then wipe those tears.

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one loves as truly as him. I guarantee!

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here to pray she loves truly too.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know her too.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When she will, she will love most truly.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Love Gulrez... Right?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're afraid too...

272
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,967
Now you know why I pray...

273
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,727
Now you know why I cry...

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's just the two of us in here, right?

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye aye.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you stop 'aye aye'ing me?

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say yeah. Say my name.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I respect you a lot.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're two years older than me, Waqar.

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The flowers and the card...

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're for her, yes?

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But they're yours now.

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, get well soon.

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You touched in the head?

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You brought these for her.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can get me tomorrow.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't dare give these to her.

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse you.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know who's standing between you and your engagement? You.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know why she left the party at the mention of the engagement?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I don't.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be a man! Act like one!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize her hand and pull her into a corner. You can find one easily in this mansion!

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say...

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I love you. Always have. Always will'...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa there, Waqar...

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd break my hand.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't rest until she's got Nano to beat me.

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well then, you can rest assured she won't agree to get engaged to you until Doomsday.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask why.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Girls hate cowards!

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They like tough guys.

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what...

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I seized her hand.

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how I feel.

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plan B.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just ignore her.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Dado

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not in the mood to get engaged right now.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in,

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Refuse?

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not <i>that</i>!</i>

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It just means... You're okay with the engagement, but okay if not!

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm not, Waqar...

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been very disturbed since then...

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never felt hungry,

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even at the sight of someone eating.

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never slept peacefully,

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never had anything but nightmares.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You</i> know that, Gulrez.</i>

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it to yourself.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't make your feelings public.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just keep it to yourself, or...

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the public will use them against you.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ever loved someone?

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You speak like you have.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't believe in fairytales in London.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You like a girl, you take her out for coffee, have a chat...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drop her home, come back... End of story.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't even miss each other?

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, aye... When you come across her number when looking for the new one's...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes, you call her too.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's okay with it?

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, mate!

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it cuts both ways!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tales of love aren't heard much outside India and Pakistan.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rest of the world's moved on.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, seriously!

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can the world go on without love?

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't believe it.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time management is the name of the game, you twit.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone's out to conquer each other.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jobs, careers, promotions...

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Amidst all this, people don't have time for anything else.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, to be frank, love wastes a <i>lot</i> of spare time.</i>

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never thought that way...

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Bout time you did.

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just make friends with a bunch of girls and you won't have time to think about your engagement.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I should get going... Neelam and Wali would be back...

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do seriously think about what I said.

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I got a point.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Definitely will.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, see you. God bless you.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take care.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll celebrate when I'm better.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lemme know when you've made friends with a girl, okay?

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sure...

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye...

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So cute.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
OW!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't exactly delighted to see Waqar.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't think about girls the right way.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All girls.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He doesn't think they deserve to be loved.

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what he's like.

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just your typical London lad.

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Time management's the name of the game, you twit', he said...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'People hardly have the time',

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And love wastes a <i>lot</i> of time'... Stuff like that.</i>

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd the twit say?

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could I say?

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just listened to him. Quietly.

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's no use arguing with his type.

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You ought to have blessed him... 'May you fall in love with someone'!

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He</i> doesn't love!</i>

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just makes 'friends'!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With God-knows how many all at once!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's got no shortage of brats in London.

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said tales of love are unheard of outside India and Pakistan...

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the rest of the world's moved on...

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Moved on to?

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd be left of the world if it moved on from love? Didn't you ask him?

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because I'm sure he would've had a most wicked answer to that.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's happened to Waqar in four years?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was not like this when he left.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My prayers seem to have worked.

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa...

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder what you pray for.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean,

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If your prayers turned him

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Into a cad and a wastrel...

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even start.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This game of blessings and curses is not for you.

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have your dinner and go to bed.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... What happened?

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said we're staying over.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought we'd stay there tonight.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did Gulrez see her?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who did he get the flowers for, the blighter?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't a clue, do you?

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez gave the flowers and the card to Waqar!

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid...

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a goner.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He got flowers for her

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But gave them to Waqar!

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As in, gave her flowers to her worst enemy!

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep at it and you're a goner, Gulrez Akhtar!

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go to bed.

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not that, Mum.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not angry.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Sad.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hardly different, is it?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fury... Or grief...

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ought to grieve.

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He came to check on her but didn't even ask her how she was,

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gave her flowers to the man whose mention gets her into a rage.

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't act like you're so smart.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know everything.

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you come back last night?

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was sleeping so peacefully.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of Gulrez, yes?

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He gave your flowers to Waqar.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what Mum says.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not me.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean...

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar's arm bled like a fountain last night,

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it was Maheen who was a sight to behold!

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She finally had pity on him

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When drops of his blood fell on her feet.

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, she almost died back then.

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal. As if he's an actual sworn enemy.

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's her Uncle's son.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No wonder it kills her to see him bleed like that.

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, Fajr.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you say it?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a lot easier.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to shut her up.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So... You gonna make friends with him?

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you gonna shut up, Fajr?

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back to breakfast. Ain't you getting late?

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye. Back to breakfast.

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need to act smart 'round here.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, fine.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But remember this...

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The times, they're-a-changin'!

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you please shut up?

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly...

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened to her?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just told you.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She shivered for a moment.

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Turned white.

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She looked at Waqar

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like she'd tear up any moment.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali...

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's changed completely!

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A Londoner through and through.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was teaching me his English tricks.

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such as?

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Seize Maheen's hand and pull her into a corner'!

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And say',

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"I love you"'...

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'"Always have, always will"'...

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it? The English trick?

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Innit?

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you actually think one could do that to Maheen?

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say that?

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That bloke's a goner.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd make mincemeat of him.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know how Neelam and I got married?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There was something between you. Some spark or something.

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There was nothing.

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wasn't even ready.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until... I did just that on Ammi Begum's birthday.

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seized her hand,

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And pulled her into a corner.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She looked at me

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With eyes that could kill.

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I didn't fear her.

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I said...

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I love you',

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'And I want to marry you'.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I promise I'll keep you happy. Forever'.

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She agreed?

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not right then.

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her burning eyes looked into mine for a few seconds

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before she pushed me away and ran off.

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you get married then?

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She gave me a gift on my birthday.

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A small packet.

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her letter

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Greeted me when I opened it.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only thing she'd written was,

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'If you can actually keep me happy forever',

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I don't see why not'!

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It must've been quite funny.

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely is more like it.

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A 'yes' in love

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't never funny.

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's always... Plain lovely.

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But to hear it, a man's gotta be one.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's just say she got here the moment you left.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The girl in the car.

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My eyes were fixed on her.

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't blink once.

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She that lovely?

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're talking about lovely! I'm thinking of who she was and which car she was driving.

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't see a thing between the bright headlights!

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you couldn't, how d'you know a girl was driving it?

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A boy would've pulled the brakes.

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ha ha... Very funny...

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with Gulrez? He's running on the road!

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jogging maybe?

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who jogs at 10 a.m.?

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And in the middle of the blimmin' road?

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get back to you.

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gotta follow him, check on him. Bye.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, bye.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez!

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast, mate!

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up?

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you running like someone's after you?

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one's...

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just going...

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To see Maheen...

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Big deal.

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she asked you to come running.

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar...

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I realise

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were absolutely right...

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On the way to the office,

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Told me the same thing

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you!

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Me?

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd I say?

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't remember, do you? I do!

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll do just what a man ought to today!

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What should a man do?

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll get the news in ten minutes!

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned! Get ready to change your view 'bout me!

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did I ever say something about you?

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You called me a twit.

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember?

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll get going.

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd <i>you</i> get in?</i>

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>You</i> opened the door, DIDN'T YOU?</i>

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
STOP IT!

589
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm your father, Jiya.

590
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You leavin' here quietly

591
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or d'you want me to call the cops?

592
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call 'em.

593
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell 'em your father's guilty

594
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of breaking and entering your place.

595
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell 'em he's begging you

596
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To listen to him

597
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just for once.

598
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He thinks he can convince you

599
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That he was guiltless.

600
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

601
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

602
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What've you got to tell someone who's seen everything with her own two eyes?

603
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, leave this place.

604
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I don't see your face,

605
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel like I'm missing you.

606
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when I do see your face,

607
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see my mother's wounds.

608
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because they filled out the charge sheet

609
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Against me before your eyes!

610
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were told that all of it

611
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was my doing.

612
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare suggest my mother was in the wrong.

613
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm here to tell you

614
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She wasn't in the wrong.

615
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

616
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it occurred to you

617
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After she died!

618
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It didn't occur to me.

619
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I've just found out

620
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That she was innocent.

621
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had my reasons

622
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To blame her.

623
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got a ton of reasons to blame you too!

624
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget I'm an eyewitness, M. Mir Mehtab Ali!

625
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll take your leave.

626
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You better not come here again.

627
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or I'd think you're here with another excuse

628
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To claim your right over this place... And me!

629
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya...

630
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This isn't my place.

631
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all yours.

632
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've left it to you.

633
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should I say 'Thank you very much'?

634
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at me, Jiya...

635
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never forget that suspicion and mistrust

636
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are antithetical to justice.

637
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Punish me any way you like for my sins,

638
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But before you do,

639
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just hear me out.

640
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just did.

641
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That'd be enough for today.

642
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll hear the rest

643
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If we meet again.

644
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As you wish.

645
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope

646
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That you never come again.

647
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
