1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,598
You're lucky.

2
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,968
You almost got pulverised.

3
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,888
What d'you mean?

4
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,557
Your fracture's minor. Mercifully.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,228
You'll be fine in a few days.

6
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,381
Naw, boyo...

7
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,208
You just got your deserts.

8
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:28,438
Feel like acting another fracture out?

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,757
Oh, please...

10
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,338
Don't even think of playing cricket for a few days.

11
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:37,338
Pressure on those two stitches ain't gonna be pleasant.

12
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,608
Ah, just lovely...

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,608
So... Who's driving?

14
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,988
Me, of course.

15
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:48,068
Don't use your right hand.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,990
May I?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,428
Please, take care.

18
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:00,068
'Course.

19
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,930
Hey...
-Hmm?

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,879
Fear God.

21
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:07,459
You're the type who gets punished instantly.

22
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,990
Alright, Reverend.

23
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:11,549
God be with ye.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,858
Yeah?

25
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:30,393
It's switched off...

26
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:32,183
Good Lord...

27
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:33,974
What are you so worried about?

28
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,224
He left without a word.

29
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:40,083
Now, his phone's switched off...

30
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:43,023
Crucified me... More or less...

31
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:44,933
He's not a kid.

32
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,294
I'm sure he's havin' a ball.

33
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:52,000
He'd have to wear that bandage 'round here.

34
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:56,214
I'm gonna take it off for everyone to see and blooter him proper.

35
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,791
I'm sure you won't blooter him.

36
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,151
You're just saying it for Maheen to hear.

37
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:02,717
Promise me, Nano...

38
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:06,592
You got to blooter him if he's actually lying!

39
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:12,937
Oh, can it... D'you seriously think it'd look good? Me blootering that 6-foot lad?

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,048
Would <i>he</i> look nice, getting himself beaten?

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,791
Paper tigers don't look too good either.

42
00:02:21,845 --> 00:02:24,590
He deserves a proper slap... At least...

43
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,551
Forget it... Your slap won't even scratch him.

44
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:32,645
Allow me. I'll smite him proper and knock some sense into him!

45
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,870
Good Heavens...

46
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,891
Haven't you been waiting for four years to do that? Hold your horses...

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,821
Aye... But one day...

48
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll get even.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,158
Whoa...

50
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:47,898
Gotta say...

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,483
That's some big words from the wee girl.

52
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,758
He's here.

53
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,511
Just bring him here.

54
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:02,342
I'll give him a taste of what he deserves.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,198
Peace, Aunt.

56
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,419
Hey!

57
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,740
Gulrez! M'boy!

58
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,629
How are you?

59
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,309
How's she?

60
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,042
Heard she got hurt.

61
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,662
She bumped into Waqar and fell.

62
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,613
It's just a scratch.

63
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:53,012
Where's she?

64
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,974
In Ammi Begum's room.

65
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:56,252
Oh...

66
00:03:58,073 --> 00:03:59,844
Peace, Uncle.

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,468
Upon you too...

68
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:05,578
Remembered your Uncle, eh?

69
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:08,739
I got a new car for you, you twit.

70
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,979
But you! You were sleeping in your Foxy's arms.

71
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,939
Ever gonna change?

72
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:16,399
Never, Uncle.

73
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,728
I can see that.

74
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,868
Hey!

75
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,269
It's Gulrez!

76
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,338
Peace, Aunt.

77
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,699
Upon you too. How are you?

78
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,649
Great.

79
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,898
Oh, please.

80
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,672
Your fiancée gave you the finger. Called off the engagement. How's that for great?

81
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,159
So what?

82
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,784
It's only called off for now...

83
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:37,794
Don't worry.

84
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,483
She's just playing with you.

85
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:40,564
I know it.

86
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:42,455
She'll say in a few days...

87
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:44,435
'Alright'...

88
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,929
'Gulrez ain't a bad choice at all'!

89
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,378
Neelam ain't here?

90
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,798
No. She's gone to the shrine with Wali.

91
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,433
Shrine?

92
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,831
She'd light a lamp.

93
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,220
Make a wish.

94
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,520
Whoa!

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,412
What's her wish?

96
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,830
No idea.

97
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,210
Hmm!

98
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,278
Pretty sure it's Maheen's acceptance,

99
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,839
For which she'd make regular offerings at the shrine, innit?

100
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,569
Go check on her.

101
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,458
No way...

102
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:25,838
Hey!

103
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:27,798
Why are you here, then?

104
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,788
That's what I came here for.

105
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,559
But I don't dare...

106
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:33,849
Keep up with that,

107
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,329
And she'd trample you under her feet!

108
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,369
She's not the type!

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,911
She just thinks...

110
00:05:41,911 --> 00:05:45,323
You've attacked her with this engagement thing.

111
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,283
She's just a bit angry.

112
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,413
You siding with her, you twit?

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,189
Not her, Aunt.

114
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:54,122
I'm siding with the truth.

115
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,711
Hmm...

116
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,774
He got flowers?

117
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:02,704
No.

118
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:06,145
Gorblimey. Nothing for the sick!

119
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:07,930
The blasted Scrooge!

120
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,948
To think <i>he</i> wants to get engaged to <i>me</i>.

121
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,751
Haven't you brought flowers or something?

122
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,311
Flowers?

123
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,239
You just... Came knocking?

124
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,868
Why're you pulling him up, Dastoor?

125
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:26,875
Blimey, Suraiyya...

126
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,779
He's visiting the sick.

127
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,499
His fiancée, no less! Couldn't the Scrooge spend a penny?

128
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,398
Tea.

129
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,848
No.

130
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,648
I'll get flowers first.

131
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,388
I was so frightened

132
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:52,148
I forgot I had to bring flowers.

133
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,899
Waqar!

134
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,318
What happened?

135
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:12,948
Nothing much... Just got hurt...

136
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,672
Oh God...

137
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,388
Looks serious.

138
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:17,118
Aye...

139
00:07:17,118 --> 00:07:18,519
But just a bit.

140
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,219
But it's okay. No problem.

141
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,130
So...

142
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,601
Where are you off to?

143
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,781
I'll be back.

144
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,481
Gotta get some flowers.

145
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,486
See you. We'll have a nice chat.

146
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:29,143
I'll be back in... 15 minutes?

147
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:30,465
Bye.

148
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,418
So...

149
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,106
How's your arm?

150
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,077
Two stitches on the elbow.

151
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,778
Hmm...

152
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,800
Peace be upon you.

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,590
And upon you, peace.

154
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,848
Blimey... Two stitches... As if the fracture wasn't enough.

155
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:48,878
Nah,

156
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,398
I'm sure he just forgot to mention it.

157
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,840
Go to Ammi Begum. Quick.

158
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,221
She's looking for you.

159
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:56,980
'Course.

160
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,729
I'm going to see her.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,660
HVT in AO!

162
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:08,972
Has he brought flowers?

163
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,153
Not the flowery bloke.

164
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,124
The dramatic one!

165
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,377
Ah...

166
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:16,013
Hi, everybody!

167
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,534
Peace, Dado.

168
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,508
Likewise...

169
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,569
Come here, m'lad.

170
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:30,530
Here.

171
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,160
Sit by me.

172
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,488
C'mon.

173
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,463
Ahh...

174
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,918
What are you up to?

175
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,073
Heard your elbow's pulverised.

176
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,961
Yet you're going about the city, driving with one hand!

177
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:56,783
I haven't seen another one like you. Not in the family at least.

178
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,823
Dado... What it is is...

179
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:00,474
Aye, what?

180
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,312
It ain't pulverised or something...

181
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,645
Just... Broken...

182
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,209
What are you lookin' at?

183
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,490
Only what you want them to look at, of course.

184
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,218
What's those pills for?

185
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,988
I heard about your broken arm.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,248
But

187
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:27,530
Never any wound.

188
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,359
It's nothing, Dado...

189
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,610
Just... Two stitches.

190
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,958
Blimey...

191
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,701
One bump and you fell apart...

192
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,490
Show me!
-Hey!

193
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,879
What are you doing?

194
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,890
I'll open it and chant an incantation for you...

195
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,134
You won't need the plaster, the bandages,

196
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,260
Or the pills!
-OW!

197
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,211
Dado!

198
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,082
It hurts real bad!

199
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,618
It's real bad, Waqar Ahmed...

200
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:57,739
You've been busted!

201
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,220
You've been busted!
-Ow!

202
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,491
You've been busted!

203
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,138
Goodness! It kills me...

204
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,088
M'boy -- Dastoor Ahmed!

205
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,588
Dastoor!

206
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,005
Come here!

207
00:10:13,005 --> 00:10:14,415
Goodness...

208
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:15,616
Relax, Dado...

209
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,192
Dado! Calm down!

210
00:10:17,252 --> 00:10:18,889
Dado! Hey!

211
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:20,260
Help her!

212
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,713
Uncle Dastoor!

213
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,754
Uncle Dastoor! Dado!

214
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,709
What happened, Dado? Easy...

215
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,080
Dado!

216
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,049
Uncle Dastoor!

217
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,410
Uncle Dastoor! What happened to Dado?

218
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,758
Dado!

219
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,948
Dado!

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,139
What happened?

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,010
Blood?

222
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,110
Dado...

223
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,401
Ammi Begum!

224
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,421
Ammi Begum! Lemme --

225
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,958
What happened?

226
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,438
When she heard about the engagement, she was drained of all cheer.

227
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,699
Almost felt like... She'd refuse...

228
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,149
She said she needed some time to think...

229
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:13,575
I'm at a dead end, so to speak...

230
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,748
Who knows how long she needs...

231
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,018
Three stitches.

232
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:23,028
It's gonna take a while now.

233
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,930
All thanks to you, you blighter!

234
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,884
You told me he was just putting up an act!

235
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,918
Tell me...

236
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:38,279
Is he?

237
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,388
What do I tell you?

238
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:42,088
He was, to begin with!

239
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:44,020
Oh, put a sock in it!

240
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,010
Your little jokes cost my lad

241
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,872
A quarter gallon of his blood.

242
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,307
M'boy...

243
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,558
Three stitches.

244
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:28,260
Not to mention the pain that refuses to go away.

245
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,081
What's it to me?

246
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,239
Nothing, I know.

247
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,341
But the least you could do is check on him.

248
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,780
Can it!

249
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,012
Fear the Lord, Maheen!

250
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,032
What's three stitches and an armache to a man?

251
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,750
Girls shouldn't be so heartless!

252
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,090
Someone's a turncoat!

253
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,671
There...

254
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,842
Someone else too, aye?

255
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:54,743
What?

256
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,838
The sight of his blood

257
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,249
Nearly killed <i>you</i> too!

258
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,989
Not <i>his</i> blood! Just the sight of blood!

259
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,980
The name's Maheen Aurangzeb.

260
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,989
They hate how I hate 'em!

261
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,588
Why are you crying?

262
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,528
Something you're afraid of?

263
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,148
What if she came here with her prayers?

264
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,304
I don't know what happens when prayers clash.

265
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,605
Whose prayers get heard?

266
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,485
The prayers of those who love truly.

267
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,426
Then wipe those tears.

268
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,031
No one loves as truly as him. I guarantee!

269
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,238
I'm here to pray she loves truly too.

270
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:00,019
I know her too.

271
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:03,619
When she will, she will love most truly.

272
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:05,938
Love Gulrez... Right?

273
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,709
You're afraid too...

274
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,708
Now you know why I pray...

275
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,409
Now you know why I cry...

276
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,827
There's just the two of us in here, right?

277
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,187
Aye aye.

278
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,588
Could you stop 'aye aye'ing me?

279
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,329
Just say yeah. Say my name.

280
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:28,782
No...

281
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,889
I respect you a lot.

282
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,269
As if

283
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:33,929
I don't!

284
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,865
You're two years older than me, Waqar.

285
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,214
Fair enough.

286
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,288
The flowers and the card...

287
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:44,469
They're for her, yes?

288
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,419
Aye.

289
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:49,355
But they're yours now.

290
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,978
Please, get well soon.

291
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,738
You touched in the head?

292
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,360
You brought these for her.

293
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,344
You can get me tomorrow.

294
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,608
I wouldn't dare give these to her.

295
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,728
Curse you.

296
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,718
You know who's standing between you and your engagement? You.

297
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,010
You know why she left the party at the mention of the engagement?

298
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,940
I swear I don't.

299
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,940
Be a man! Act like one!

300
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:17,838
Seize her hand and pull her into a corner. You can find one easily in this mansion!

301
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,108
Just say...

302
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:22,529
'I love you. Always have. Always will'...

303
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,559
Whoa there, Waqar...

304
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,809
She'd break my hand.

305
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:29,120
She won't rest until she's got Nano to beat me.

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,888
Well then, you can rest assured she won't agree to get engaged to you until Doomsday.

307
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,258
Ask why.

308
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:34,764
Why?

309
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,899
Girls hate cowards!

310
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,689
They like tough guys.

311
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,230
Know what...

312
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,870
I'd die

313
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,526
If I seized her hand.

314
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:47,449
That's how I feel.

315
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,321
Alright.

316
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,869
Plan B.

317
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,336
Yeah?

318
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:56,330
Just ignore her.

319
00:17:57,261 --> 00:17:58,741
Tell Dado

320
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:01,161
You're not in the mood to get engaged right now.

321
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,846
As in,

322
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,581
Refuse?

323
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,590
Not <i>that</i>!

324
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,381
It just means... You're okay with the engagement, but okay if not!

325
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,928
Except... I'm not, Waqar...

326
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,288
I've been very disturbed since then...

327
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:17,319
Never felt hungry,

328
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:19,711
Even at the sight of someone eating.

329
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:21,491
Never slept peacefully,

330
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,740
Never had anything but nightmares.

331
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,961
<i>You</i> know that, Gulrez.

332
00:18:25,961 --> 00:18:27,642
Keep it to yourself.

333
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,201
Don't make your feelings public.

334
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,802
Just keep it to yourself, or...

335
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:33,633
Or?

336
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:36,742
Or the public will use them against you.

337
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:39,495
Ever loved someone?

338
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:40,963
I mean,

339
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:43,044
You speak like you have.

340
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,809
We don't believe in fairytales in London.

341
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,304
You like a girl, you take her out for coffee, have a chat...

342
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:53,248
Drop her home, come back... End of story.

343
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,994
You don't even miss each other?

344
00:18:55,994 --> 00:18:57,809
Not at all.

345
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:02,714
Sometimes, aye... When you come across her number when looking for the new one's...

346
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:04,244
Sometimes, you call her too.

347
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,224
And

348
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,584
She's okay with it?

349
00:19:06,584 --> 00:19:07,830
Of course, mate!

350
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,767
Because it cuts both ways!

351
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:14,088
Tales of love aren't heard much outside India and Pakistan.

352
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,606
The rest of the world's moved on.

353
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,198
Like, seriously!

354
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,168
How can the world go on without love?

355
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,852
I don't believe it.

356
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,091
Time management is the name of the game, numbskull.

357
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,121
Everyone's out to conquer each other.

358
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:30,351
Jobs, careers, promotions...

359
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:33,999
Amidst all this, people don't have time for anything else.

360
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,621
And, to be frank, love wastes <i>a lot</i> of spare time.

361
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,921
I never thought that way...

362
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,367
'Bout time you did.

363
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:47,338
Just make friends with a bunch of girls and you won't have time to think about your engagement.

364
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,592
What happened?

365
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,280
I should get going... Neelam and Wali would be back...

366
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,528
Hey...

367
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,668
Do seriously think about what I said.

368
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,438
I got a point.

369
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,528
Aye.

370
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,438
Definitely will.

371
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,381
Alright, see you. God bless you.

372
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,338
Take care.

373
00:20:11,248 --> 00:20:12,249
I will.

374
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:14,520
We'll celebrate when I'm better.

375
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:18,461
Lemme know when you've made friends with a girl, okay?

376
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,421
Sure...

377
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:22,890
I will.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,329
Bye.

379
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,299
Bye...

380
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,860
So cute.

381
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,744
OW!

382
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,997
I ain't exactly delighted to see Waqar.

383
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:40,617
Why?

384
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,454
He doesn't think about girls the right way.

385
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:49,734
Who?

386
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,010
All girls.

387
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,918
He doesn't think they deserve to be loved.

388
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,818
That's what he's like.

389
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,999
Aye.

390
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,370
Just your typical London lad.

391
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,370
'Time management's the name of the game, numbskull', he said...

392
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,040
'People hardly have the time',

393
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,672
'And love wastes <i>a lot</i> of time'... Stuff like that.

394
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,573
What'd the numbskull say?

395
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,037
What could I say?

396
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:21,938
I just listened to him. Quietly.

397
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:24,929
It's no use arguing with his type.

398
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:25,984
Hmm...

399
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:30,845
You ought to have blessed him... 'May you fall in love with someone'!

400
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,561
<i>He</i> doesn't love!

401
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:35,100
He just makes 'friends'!

402
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,911
With God-knows how many all at once!

403
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,543
I'm sure he's got no shortage of brats in London.

404
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,198
Tell me...

405
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,638
Hmm?

406
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:51,808
He said tales of love are unheard of outside India and Pakistan...

407
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,870
And the rest of the world's moved on...

408
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:59,460
Moved on to?

409
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,622
What'd be left of the world if it moved on from love? Didn't you ask him?

410
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,518
I didn't.

411
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:10,109
Because I'm sure he would've had a most wicked answer to that.

412
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,299
What's happened to Waqar in four years?

413
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,889
He was not like that when he left.

414
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:22,595
My prayers seem to have worked.

415
00:23:23,086 --> 00:23:24,207
Whoa...

416
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:26,393
Wonder what you pray for.

417
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:28,064
I mean,

418
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:29,770
If your prayers turned him

419
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,948
Into a cad and a wastrel...

420
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,268
Don't even start.

421
00:23:35,268 --> 00:23:37,829
This game of blessings and curses is not for you.

422
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:39,858
Have your dinner and go to bed.

423
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:41,518
Good night.

424
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,350
So... What happened?

425
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,477
Nothing.

426
00:24:01,477 --> 00:24:03,317
She said we're staying over.

427
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,208
I thought we'd stay there tonight.

428
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:07,988
Did Gulrez see her?

429
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,085
No.

430
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,030
Who did he get the flowers for, the blighter?

431
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,157
You haven't a clue, do you?

432
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:18,308
Gulrez gave the flowers and the card to Waqar!

433
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,558
Splendid...

434
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,611
He's a goner.

435
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,670
He got flowers for her

436
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,491
But gave them to Waqar!

437
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:28,881
As in, gave her flowers to her worst enemy!

438
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:32,241
Keep at it and you're a goner, Gulrez Akhtar!

439
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,414
Go to bed.

440
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,648
It's not that, Mum.

441
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:41,978
She's not angry.

442
00:24:42,198 --> 00:24:44,388
Just... Sad.

443
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,568
Hardly different, is it?

444
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,079
Fury... Or grief...

445
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,399
She ought to grieve.

446
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:52,299
He came to check on her but didn't even ask her how she was,

447
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:56,019
Gave her flowers to the man whose mention gets her into a rage.

448
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,379
Don't act like you're so smart.

449
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,189
I know everything.

450
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,638
So...

451
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,811
Why'd you come back last night?

452
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,032
I was sleeping so peacefully.

453
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,694
Because of Gulrez, yes?

454
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,908
He gave your flowers to Waqar.

455
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,118
That's what Mum says.

456
00:26:54,118 --> 00:26:56,043
Not me.

457
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,625
What d'you think?

458
00:26:58,701 --> 00:26:59,622
I mean...

459
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:02,443
Waqar's arm bled like a fountain last night,

460
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:04,804
But it was Maheen who was a sight to behold!

461
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:06,939
She finally had pity on him

462
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:09,750
When drops of his blood fell on her feet.

463
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:12,368
I swear, she almost died back then.

464
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,978
Big deal. As if he's an actual sworn enemy.

465
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,369
He's her Uncle's son.

466
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:23,381
No wonder it kills her to see him bleed like that.

467
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,918
Shut up, Fajr.

468
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,618
Why don't you say it?

469
00:27:29,618 --> 00:27:31,038
It's a lot easier.

470
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,398
You don't need to shut her up.

471
00:27:34,758 --> 00:27:36,168
It's nothing like that.

472
00:27:36,168 --> 00:27:39,289
So... You gonna make friends with him?

473
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,748
Are you gonna shut up, Fajr?

474
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,649
Back to breakfast. Ain't you getting late?

475
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,090
Aye. Back to breakfast.

476
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,709
No need to act smart 'round here.

477
00:27:51,709 --> 00:27:52,771
Okay, fine.

478
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,841
But remember this...

479
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,052
The times, they're-a-changin'!

480
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,994
Will you please shut up?

481
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,589
Will you?

482
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,101
Honestly...

483
00:28:11,101 --> 00:28:12,687
What happened to her?

484
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:13,922
I just told you.

485
00:28:13,922 --> 00:28:15,531
She shivered for a moment.

486
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:16,971
Turned white.

487
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,160
She looked at Waqar

488
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,378
Like she'd tear up any moment.

489
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,947
Wali...

490
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:35,698
He's changed completely!

491
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:37,869
A Londoner through and through.

492
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:41,179
He was teaching me his English tricks.

493
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:43,289
Such as?

494
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,213
'Seize Maheen's hand and pull her into a corner'!

495
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:48,641
'And say',

496
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,508
'"I love you"'...

497
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,742
'"Always have, always will"'...

498
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,497
That it? The English trick?

499
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,277
Innit?

500
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:02,437
D'you actually think one could do that to Maheen?

501
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:04,138
And say that?

502
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,399
That bloke's a goner.

503
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,391
She'd make mincemeat of him.

504
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,852
Know how Neelam and I got married?

505
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:11,974
I know.

506
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,884
There was something between you. Some spark or something.

507
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:17,095
There was nothing.

508
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,999
She wasn't even ready.

509
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:23,619
Until... I did just that on Ammi Begum's birthday.

510
00:29:23,738 --> 00:29:25,429
Seized her hand,

511
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:27,720
And pulled her into a corner.

512
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,153
She looked at me

513
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,293
With eyes that could kill.

514
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:33,024
I didn't fear her.

515
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,138
I said...

516
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:37,227
'I love you',

517
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,888
'And I want to marry you'.

518
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,379
'I promise I'll keep you happy. Forever'.

519
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,098
She agreed?

520
00:29:45,149 --> 00:29:46,819
Not right then.

521
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,891
Her burning eyes looked into mine for a few seconds

522
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,657
Before she pushed me away and ran off.

523
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,888
How'd you get married then?

524
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,208
She gave me a gift on my birthday.

525
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:03,083
A small packet.

526
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,982
Her letter

527
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:07,578
Greeted me when I opened it.

528
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:10,049
The only thing she'd written was,

529
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,990
'If you can actually keep me happy forever',

530
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,700
'I don't see why not'!

531
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,947
Blimey...

532
00:30:21,008 --> 00:30:23,158
It must've been quite funny.

533
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,932
Not at all.

534
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,909
Lovely is more like it.

535
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,548
A 'yes' in love

536
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,861
Ain't never funny.

537
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,983
It's always... Plain lovely.

538
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,088
But to hear it, a man's gotta be one.

539
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,852
Let's just say she got here the moment you left.

540
00:30:57,908 --> 00:30:59,098
Who?

541
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:01,318
The girl in the car.

542
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,069
My eyes were fixed on her.

543
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,368
I couldn't blink once.

544
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:08,700
She that lovely?

545
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,438
You're talking about lovely! I'm thinking of who she was and which car she was driving.

546
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:17,669
I couldn't see a thing between the bright headlights!

547
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:22,160
If you couldn't, how d'you know a girl was driving it?

548
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,478
A boy would've pulled the brakes.

549
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,809
Ha ha... Very funny...

550
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,987
Hey!

551
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:30,450
What happened?

552
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,948
What's up with Gulrez? He's running on the road!

553
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:34,478
Jogging maybe?

554
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,438
Who jogs at 10 a.m.?

555
00:31:36,438 --> 00:31:38,759
And in the middle of the blimmin' road?

556
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:39,990
I'll get back to you.

557
00:31:40,026 --> 00:31:42,970
Gotta follow him, check on him. Bye.

558
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:44,973
Okay, bye.

559
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,578
Gulrez!

560
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,349
Not so fast, mate!

561
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,828
What's up?

562
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:10,168
Why are you running like someone's after you?

563
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,308
No...

564
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,788
No one's...

565
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:14,070
Just going...

566
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,788
To see Maheen...

567
00:32:15,788 --> 00:32:16,819
Big deal.

568
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:19,000
As if she asked you to come running.

569
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
No, Waqar...

570
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,700
I realise

571
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,321
You were absolutely right...

572
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,768
How?

573
00:32:25,973 --> 00:32:27,689
On the way to the office,

574
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:28,768
Wali

575
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:30,568
Told me the same thing

576
00:32:30,568 --> 00:32:32,344
As you!

577
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:33,437
Me?

578
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,859
What'd I say?

579
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,041
You don't remember, do you? I do!

580
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,881
I'll do just what a man ought to today!

581
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,690
What should a man do?

582
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:46,050
You'll get the news in ten minutes!

583
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,149
Stay tuned! Get ready to change your view 'bout me!

584
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:51,949
Did I ever say something about you?

585
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,858
You called me numbskull.

586
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:56,458
Remember?

587
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:58,489
I'll get going.

588
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,939
How'd <i>you</i> get in?

589
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,270
<i>You</i> opened the door, DIDN'T YOU?

590
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,698
STOP IT!

591
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,538
I'm your father, Jiya.

592
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,489
You leavin' here quietly

593
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:07,561
Or d'you want me to call the cops?

594
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:09,055
Call 'em.

595
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,558
Tell 'em your father's guilty

596
00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:15,279
Of breaking and entering your place.

597
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:17,209
Tell 'em he's begging you

598
00:34:17,209 --> 00:34:19,160
To listen to him

599
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,262
Just for once.

600
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,958
He thinks he can convince you

601
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,113
That he was guiltless.

602
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,708
What is it?

603
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,878
Yeah?

604
00:34:32,928 --> 00:34:37,189
What've you got to tell someone who's seen everything with her own two eyes?

605
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,368
Please, leave this place.

606
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,838
If I don't see your face,

607
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,988
I feel like I'm missing you.

608
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,908
But when I do see your face,

609
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,168
I see my mother's wounds.

610
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,572
Because they filled out the charge sheet

611
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,042
Against me before your eyes!

612
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,478
You were told that all of it

613
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,308
Was my doing.

614
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:19,563
Don't you dare suggest my mother was in the wrong.

615
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:22,740
I'm here to tell you

616
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,309
She wasn't in the wrong.

617
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:26,859
Oh!

618
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,120
So it occurred to you

619
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,217
<i>After</i> she died!

620
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,648
It didn't occur to me.

621
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,500
I swear, I've just found out

622
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,797
That she was innocent.

623
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:44,907
I had my reasons

624
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,363
To blame her.

625
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,739
I've got <i>a ton</i> of reasons to blame you too!

626
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,949
Don't forget I'm an eyewitness, M. Mir Mehtab Ali!

627
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,159
I'll take your leave.

628
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,718
You better not come here again.

629
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,340
Or I'd think you're here with another excuse

630
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,098
To claim your right over this place... And me!

631
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,479
Jiya...

632
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,567
This isn't my place.

633
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,257
It's all yours.

634
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:30,468
I've left it to you.

635
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,958
Should I say 'Thank you very much'?

636
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,291
Look at me, Jiya...

637
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:46,041
Never forget that suspicion and mistrust

638
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:48,451
Are antithetical to justice.

639
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,118
Punish me any way you like for my sins,

640
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,548
But before you do,

641
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,878
Just hear me out.

642
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,768
I just did.

643
00:37:02,518 --> 00:37:05,078
That'd be enough for today.

644
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,388
I'll hear the rest

645
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:11,343
If we meet again.

646
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,828
As you wish.

647
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,428
I hope

648
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,600
That you never come here again.

649
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
