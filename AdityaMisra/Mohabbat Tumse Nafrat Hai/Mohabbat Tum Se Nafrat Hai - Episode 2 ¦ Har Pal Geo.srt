1
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:27,598
This last will and testament is hereby recorded as decreed

2
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,256
Copies of the will

3
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,316
Shall be sent to each heritor today

4
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:36,916
To be signed by them.

5
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,656
Should they have any opposition

6
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:44,116
They shall have fifteen days to express the same.

7
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:50,096
Else, this bequest will be assumed to have been accepted as just and fair.

8
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,566
Yes.

9
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,206
That's right.

10
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:08,420
Ammi Begum

11
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,245
Madam, please sign here.

12
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:26,938
Look.

13
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,890
Munshi Alam has arrived too.

14
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,109
Madam, we require your thumb impression here.

15
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:24,219
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

16
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:36,550
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

17
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:48,660
<i>What good is grieving and writhing in your name?</i>

18
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,856
Sir?

19
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:11,160
My car's not starting.

20
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:16,243
Car?

21
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,494
The banger's a Foxy.

22
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:19,993
Yes

23
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,573
It's a Foxy.

24
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:24,420
But you're saying it's a car.

25
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,182
Is it not a car to you?

26
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:28,600
Come on, bro.

27
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,245
A Foxy's a Foxy.

28
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:32,020
Not a car.

29
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,990
Come, mate.

30
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,044
Hey!

31
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:52,554
This is Gulrez's Foxy.

32
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,609
How come it's alone out here?

33
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,119
Hey!

34
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,779
Where's your husband?

35
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,202
Probably had a domestic.

36
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:10,841
Even then, the pride of the family is not to be abandoned on the streets like this.

37
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,985
Splendid.

38
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,370
This Foxy is parked right in the middle of the road,

39
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,219
And Gulrez is nowhere to be seen.

40
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,089
Oh God!

41
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,419
What am I witnessing here?

42
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,799
Such immodesty, Maheen!

43
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,249
Arthritis.

44
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,532
Arthritis?

45
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,323
Pain in the knee joints.

46
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,889
Unable to move any further, she'd have said to Gulrez Bhai,

47
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,904
'End of the line, mate'!

48
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:43,646
Take out the rope.

49
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,116
I swear, Wali

50
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:54,596
She worked just fine when I left.

51
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:57,266
Ran smoothly as if waltzing.

52
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,233
When I

53
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,983
Stopped at the traffic signal,

54
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:04,233
I thought I heard something.

55
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:06,513
She worked fine again

56
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:08,476
But

57
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:11,653
Barely moved another hundred yards.

58
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,330
Mind if I say something?

59
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:27,980
It is time.

60
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,530
Time for what?

61
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:34,232
I mean, be done with it.

62
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:37,422
Look at her age and resilience.

63
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:39,461
Tell me honestly,

64
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:42,142
What else do you expect from her?

65
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,416
Put it plainly

66
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,376
What are you trying to say?
-Sell it.

67
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,630
Sell the Foxy?

68
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,839
Alright, don't sell it.

69
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,867
Let it be this way:

70
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,777
Park it on the porch

71
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,456
Adorn it with a garland

72
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,179
And shower rose petals on it.

73
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,006
But please do one thing

74
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,577
Purchase a new car to drive to office.

75
00:09:02,577 --> 00:09:04,786
Accursed be the new car.

76
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:08,177
Just to show people like you,

77
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:11,917
I cannot sell the one I've loved for fifteen years.

78
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,346
No.

79
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:16,046
Never.

80
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,790
Stop the car.

81
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,409
Stop the car, please.

82
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,510
Where did it vanish?

83
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:53,147
You mean the Foxy?

84
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:54,355
Of course, Wali.

85
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,617
What else could I mean?

86
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:59,177
Where did you park it?

87
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,200
Right here.

88
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:03,628
No.

89
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:05,217
You're forgetting something.

90
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:09,877
You're so worried you're unable to remember correctly; think harder.

91
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,718
Think harder about what?

92
00:10:11,718 --> 00:10:14,201
I left her right here

93
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,388
One hundred percent.

94
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,098
At this very spot --

95
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:18,758
Look!

96
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,799
Tire marks!

97
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:23,939
Has this happened before?

98
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:24,689
How --

99
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,190
You left her and she drove off?

100
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:28,820
Fantastic, Wali.

101
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
How can she drive off on her own?

102
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,739
She couldn't walk one inch from this spot.

103
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,636
That means it's been stolen.

104
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:39,776
Have you, ever in your life,

105
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,275
Heard or read that someone's Foxy got stolen?

106
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,015
Thieves are getting innovative these days.

107
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,397
Who knows?

108
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,015
One might've taken a liking to it!

109
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,965
How much would it fetch?

110
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,371
What do you mean, 'fetch'?

111
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,569
The thief, after all

112
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:02,409
Surely does not intend to use it as a rooster coop.

113
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,239
Look, Wali

114
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:08,010
You don't understand my feelings.

115
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,612
Everybody understands your feelings.

116
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,568
Neelam says

117
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:15,127
One just needs to witness your relationship with your Foxy

118
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,939
To understand how you would treat your wife.

119
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:20,603
To the police station.

120
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,810
Haul on the bo'lin!

121
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,703
The bo'lin haul!

122
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:28,359
Haul on the bo'lin!

123
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:30,523
The bloody ship's is a-rollin'!

124
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,763
That's it!

125
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,374
Alright.

126
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,571
What now?

127
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,721
That which happens in kidnapping cases.

128
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:47,441
You'll collect a ransom from him?

129
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:48,591
Why not?

130
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:49,832
Put a sock in it!

131
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,481
Chap's a miser.

132
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:53,962
He'll weep out of sorrow

133
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:56,351
But won't give a penny.

134
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:57,892
In that case

135
00:11:57,892 --> 00:12:02,062
This Foxy stays here for the next hundred years.

136
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,779
Hello?

137
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,669
Yes, we're headed to the police station.

138
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,080
What happened?

139
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,141
Thieving rascal.

140
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,610
He's going to die by Gulrez's hand.

141
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,224
'Thieving rascal'? What are you talking about?

142
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,350
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

143
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,810
Oh God!

144
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,590
Say something more than just 'Oh God'.

145
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,771
Thank you, O God!

146
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,821
Just pray that it's found.

147
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,072
May God will that it never be found.

148
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm disconnecting for now.

149
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,216
You were talking to Neelam?

150
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:53,616
Yes.

151
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,206
Why did she say, 'Oh God'?

152
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:00,017
She was worried.

153
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:03,417
Exclaimed, 'Oh God' on hearing about it.

154
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:11,297
Deep down, she loves Foxy too.

155
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,316
Yes...

156
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,620
Peace be upon you, Munshi Uncle!

157
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,920
Peace be upon you!

158
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,660
Munshi Uncle, catch the keys.

159
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,942
Peace be upon you, Auntie!

160
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,470
And upon you, peace.

161
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,302
And it's not 'Auntie;' say 'aintín'.

162
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,429
She'll be scornful about it if she hears it.

163
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,489
Where is she?

164
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,570
She's praying.

165
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,376
Right,

166
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,908
Mr Gulrez!

167
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,926
What colour is your car?

168
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,676
Maroon.

169
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,912
Maroon...

170
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,908
Model?

171
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,696
1966.

172
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:14,538
1966...

173
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:26,420
Mind if I say something?

174
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,532
Please.

175
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:30,189
Don't file a complaint for theft.

176
00:14:30,728 --> 00:14:31,962
Why?

177
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:35,503
Such an old car isn't getting stolen.

178
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:40,784
Then what might have happened to her?

179
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:42,768
Leave it be.

180
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:46,172
Tell me, did it work?

181
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,404
Work?

182
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,420
What?

183
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:58,195
You don't need to ask.

184
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,996
It works so well

185
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:05,025
With the attitude of a viscountess!

186
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,567
Just sometimes --

187
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,147
Sometimes --?

188
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:11,806
If it ever stopped working

189
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:15,337
I'd take it to the workshop using Wali's car.

190
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:18,117
And the address of the workshop?

191
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,710
It sure hasn't gone to the workshop on its own...

192
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:30,986
You can never know, my good sir...

193
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,989
If only we knew what surprise awaits...

194
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,659
Don't worry, though.

195
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:43,489
You're at the right place.

196
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,020
I'd never thought of it.

197
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,542
That I'd have to come here

198
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,875
Because of her.

199
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,110
Stop, Maheen.

200
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:07,955
My first benediction in orison is for you.

201
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:12,872
And a prayer that you pay a visit precedes it.

202
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:18,146
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

203
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,849
It kills me to hear that!

204
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,277
Poor Gulrez.

205
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,306
Poor thief.

206
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:31,366
What will he do with it?

207
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,636
If the right compensation isn't received,

208
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,886
Set it ablaze by the shore!

209
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,276
What do you mean?

210
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:43,986
The thief

211
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,736
Is none but me.

212
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,560
Don't do it, the poor lad will die.

213
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,974
I'll return it before he dies!

214
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,750
But however did you manage to steal the Foxy?

215
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,200
It's not as if it's a matchbox.

216
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:01,420
Just think, Nano, as if

217
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,460
The Foxy is inside a matchbox!

218
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:06,827
But

219
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,007
You have to make a promise to me.

220
00:17:09,414 --> 00:17:11,209
What promise?

221
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,974
You haven't the foggiest about the Foxy.

222
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,146
I mean

223
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,926
Neither do you know about the theft

224
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:20,196
Nor about the thief.

225
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,662
Hold up.

226
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:29,106
Alright, let me get up from this sacred spot.

227
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,486
You have to make a promise too.

228
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:37,517
What promise?

229
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,676
You

230
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:45,726
Will only inflict as much torment as the poor man can bear.

231
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:48,056
Then you don't know, Nano.

232
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,419
He's not beggarly.

233
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:51,879
The only poverty that afflicts him is related to pluck!

234
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,359
And his breed of destitutes get a strike

235
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,489
Where there's not the slightest relief.

236
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,899
Step aside.

237
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:01,350
Blabbering on and on and --

238
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,270
Alright.

239
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,801
I'll strike him where he'll have the slightest of relief.

240
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,679
Listen!

241
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:10,881
Tell me

242
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:14,043
Where have you kept the banger?

243
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:16,472
In a matchbox!

244
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:31,226
Oh Gulrez...!

245
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,440
Tell me about the tyres.

246
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,460
What do you mean?

247
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,692
Tell me the age.

248
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,669
When did you purchase them?

249
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:51,162
Around -- four months ago?

250
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:53,424
Wow...

251
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,410
Then the tyres can lead one to consider it...

252
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,731
Consider what?

253
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,130
You'll not understand it, Mr Gulrez.

254
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,660
Tell me - did you have a tape deck in it?

255
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,569
Why not?

256
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,580
Plus, I change it every year.

257
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,353
That's it, then!

258
00:19:15,976 --> 00:19:17,586
What's it?

259
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,029
Case closed.

260
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:23,606
Rest assured, gentlemen!

261
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,030
Leave it to us.

262
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:30,676
It'll be found when we're done with our rest, won't it?

263
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,972
How many hours do you sleep?

264
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:35,440
Oh sir...

265
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,443
Who'll be able to sleep now?

266
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:40,786
No, Mr Gulrez...

267
00:19:40,786 --> 00:19:46,597
Having a nice and peaceful sleep is important.

268
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:53,016
Hey girl!

269
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,866
You won't have anything before you leave?

270
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:58,136
If I have something here, will I just stare at people eating at Neelam's birthday party?

271
00:19:58,136 --> 00:19:59,587
No, young lady.

272
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:02,087
Something else is going on...

273
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,546
What could it be?

274
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,090
The redness on your cheeks suggests...

275
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,773
You've been leeching someone's blood.

276
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:14,849
Suspicion

277
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:18,120
Suspicion is the pair of scissors that cuts the threads of affection.

278
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,989
It has already snipped, my dear...

279
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:24,929
It'll be clear within a few hours who's been struck.

280
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,990
Let me know when it's clear to you!

281
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,010
Bye!

282
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,912
Listen!

283
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,879
Tell Mum that Dastoor Ahmed will be late.

284
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:34,939
He'll take me and Mum along with him.

285
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,409
Only you!

286
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:37,681
Why?

287
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,429
Nano's coming with us!

288
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,029
Fajr!

289
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:43,989
Fajr!

290
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,042
She's stolen

291
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:16,229
Gulrez's Foxy.

292
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:17,993
You've found out?

293
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:22,229
She told me about her latest exploit herself!

294
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,086
She had me promise not to tell anyone!

295
00:21:25,086 --> 00:21:26,860
Oh?

296
00:21:27,007 --> 00:21:29,876
She had me promise too.

297
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:32,798
But I've reneged on it.

298
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,070
I'm honestly worried, Ammi Begum.

299
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:39,000
Why are you worried?

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,001
She may create a scene over it.

301
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,039
Leave it be.

302
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,269
I used to fight such battles with your father.

303
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,569
Dad used to say,

304
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:57,099
'This girl never fails to ruffle Siraj Ahmed'.

305
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:59,428
And see,

306
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:04,326
At the age of 60 years,

307
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:09,276
He departed after 120 years of life.

308
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,651
In his last moments,

309
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:15,616
He seized my hand and said,

310
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:20,366
'I used to cower before you for nothing, Kaneez Begum'.

311
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:23,043
If you say, should I ask?

312
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,335
Don't you dare!

313
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:27,920
Don't even say a word.

314
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,690
Let me handle the talking.

315
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,294
She'll be going to the birthday party with me in the evening.

316
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:37,120
I'll ask her on the way.

317
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,130
Ask her when the car is moving slowly.

318
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,840
Or stopped at a traffic signal.

319
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,021
Why?

320
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,361
Just --

321
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:50,140
Dad used to say, 'Drive neither in excessive sorrow nor in ebullience'.

322
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,240
She's here.

323
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,070
Disconnect the phone.

324
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,499
And don't say

325
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:01,129
That I mentioned the theft.

326
00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:09,949
Who were you talking to?

327
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,519
To Ammi Begum.

328
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,949
You told her?

329
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:16,802
Of course not; there was no mention of the Foxy.

330
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:20,291
She was just asking me what I'd wear for the birthday celebration.

331
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,234
And what will you wear?

332
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,870
I'm thinking

333
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,889
Of a pink sari...

334
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:28,309
That's great!

335
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,389
You're really decking up for Neelam's birthday.

336
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,749
Keep the black one as well.

337
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:35,920
Why?

338
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,439
Who knows if there'll be cause for celebration at all!

339
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:39,260
Why not?

340
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,261
He's got such a puny heart, Mum.

341
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,309
Who knows, it may just go boom at the mention of the ransom!

342
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,300
How much will you demand?

343
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,919
Just about a 100-150 grand or so.

344
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,509
What?

345
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:51,009
Are you in your senses?

346
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,299
If you ask for a hundred grand, he won't give you.

347
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,736
He'll give you his head.

348
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,939
By God!

349
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:57,425
What a spectacle will that be!

350
00:23:57,425 --> 00:24:01,909
For the first time, a man will give his head for a Foxy!

351
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,620
Then I'll write in my diary,

352
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,369
'I've not seen such a one as you, Gulrez Akhtar',

353
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:10,999
'You're not dead; you're a martyr'.

354
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:18,719
Go.

355
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,857
Careful!

356
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:22,976
Need any help?

357
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:25,506
Please, enjoy the party.

358
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,875
Have you no shame, Wali Ahmed?

359
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,759
Keep on serving her with such sobreity

360
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,460
And you might just end up dancing to her tunes forever!

361
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,879
You know well enough, Aunt Mehru.

362
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,589
If I am able to dance to her tunes,

363
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,305
I'd be greatly honoured.

364
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:46,569
Oh?

365
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,569
So that's what you desire!

366
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,290
At my friend's mehendi [wedding ritual]

367
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,967
She was in the mood for a presto

368
00:24:52,967 --> 00:24:56,396
I couldn't even keep up with the rhythm.

369
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,340
You're so indecorous!

370
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:03,870
Stay tuned for more!

371
00:25:05,856 --> 00:25:06,966
Hey!

372
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:09,120
Congratulations to you

373
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,061
You've got a terpsichorean for a husband!

374
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,046
Congratulate her, Aunt!

375
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:19,536
It's not necessary for everything to go with the rhythm!

376
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:28,346
You haven't asked, Nano

377
00:25:28,346 --> 00:25:31,626
Why I've brought petals along with the bouquet.

378
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,499
I know.

379
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,216
Yes, that's why you're our friend.

380
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:38,036
You're so intelligent.

381
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,326
Why the petals, Dado?

382
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:46,837
This buffon has a feeling that he'd die of sorrow on hearing about the Foxy.

383
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:51,636
And she'll shower these petals on his body.

384
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:52,907
Oh my God!

385
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:55,346
This will ruin the birthday celebrations!

386
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,937
Leave it be!

387
00:25:57,003 --> 00:25:59,418
Tell me Maheen,

388
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:04,996
If you're married off to someone like him --

389
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:14,346
Life will come to a standstill like this, Nano!

390
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:38,272
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!

391
00:26:38,272 --> 00:26:40,565
Why are you speaking English?

392
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:44,253
Because Ammi Begum isn't around!

393
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,570
Peace be upon you, Dastoor Uncle!

394
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,270
And upon you, peace!

395
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,611
Thank you!

396
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,551
Welcome.

397
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:54,921
Cutting the cake will have to wait four hours.

398
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:57,860
Why, Uncle?

399
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,665
A bit of a problem.

400
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,238
By the way, where's Ammi Begum?

401
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,238
Yes?

402
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:06,538
What do you want from Ammi Begum?

403
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:09,221
Happy Birthday!

404
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,008
Thank you!

405
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,222
Happy Birthday!

406
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,940
Thank you!

407
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,720
Before you arrived, Ammi Begum

408
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,770
He was speaking English!

409
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,350
Defiantly, I will today.

410
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,612
Hold your tongue, Dastoor Ahmed.

411
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:07,096
You getting thwacked at this age isn't going to look nice.

412
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:08,626
I've brought news

413
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,466
I will break it after four hours.

414
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:13,176
Speak right now.

415
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:17,056
Right now, I will narrate it in English.

416
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,206
Alright

417
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:21,810
Break the news after four hours.

418
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,339
Come.

419
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,134
Where's Gulrez?

420
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:30,876
The colleen's in mourning.

421
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:32,450
Mourning?

422
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,325
His Foxy's been stolen.

423
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:38,539
What kind of fool has stolen it?

424
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,012
Don't say it so loud.

425
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:41,862
He'll start wailing.

426
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:44,166
Anyways, where is he?

427
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,629
Perhaps it's not been stolen.

428
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,359
It's been stolen.

429
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,559
It could've been abducted.

430
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:53,837
Abducted?

431
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:54,910
Just tell me

432
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,030
If you have to pay 25 gee as compensation,

433
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,210
Can you make this sacrifice for your Foxy?

434
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,269
Who's collecting it?

435
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:05,907
I'm just asking -- so to speak.

436
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:10,159
I can do anything for my Foxy.

437
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,779
But --

438
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,509
25 gee is a bit too much.

439
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,999
Your love is not true.

440
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:21,007
It's nothing like that.

441
00:29:21,423 --> 00:29:23,283
I just don't have the dough --

442
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:24,823
Fibster!

443
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:27,706
Aunt Suraiyya

444
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,477
Look at that.

445
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:32,897
Say it before they do, please?

446
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,987
That Gulrez is Maheen's.

447
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:36,794
What?

448
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:38,594
Gulrez is Maheen's.

449
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,564
Please say it.

450
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,378
Alright.

451
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,935
Maheen is Gulrez's.

452
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:31,266
The weather ain't bad.

453
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:36,426
Come on.

454
00:30:36,426 --> 00:30:37,816
See you soon!

455
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:38,766
How long are you here?

456
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:39,806
No idea.

457
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,046
Well, I'll see you soon then!

458
00:30:42,743 --> 00:30:43,823
Alright.

459
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:45,524
Let's meet again soon then. Bye.

460
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:46,763
Bye!

461
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:51,163
Munshi Alam!

462
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:55,913
You look so old!

463
00:30:55,913 --> 00:30:59,344
Not a penny less than 25 gee.

464
00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:02,853
Where's the car?

465
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:04,304
The Foxy - not the car.

466
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,853
And we don't know where it is.

467
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:09,303
But we can look for it for you.

468
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:14,933
Alright.

469
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,544
Deal.

470
00:31:17,093 --> 00:31:20,468
Place 25 gee on Fajr's palm.

471
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:23,856
I will give it when the Foxy is found.

472
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:26,543
First, the buck; then we work.

473
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:30,493
Don't you trust me?

474
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,696
Not at all.

475
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,684
Have this sweet, quickly.

476
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:37,464
What's the occasion?

477
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,685
Not trusting him!

478
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:42,195
We'll have one too, then.

479
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:43,496
Yes, please.

480
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:44,895
Have one.

481
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,546
And you too.

482
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:58,765
Alright, tell me in English.

483
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,173
Tell you what?

484
00:32:00,173 --> 00:32:02,673
What's the news?

485
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:04,514
Oh --

486
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,174
Say it quickly.

487
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,854
Waqar Ahmed is coming.

488
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:13,346
Wa --

489
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,876
Waq --

490
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,596
Waqar Ahmed!

491
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,799
I'd die of happiness, Dastoor Ahmed!

492
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,489
That's why

493
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,487
That's why I had said

494
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:31,463
That I'd say it in English.

495
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:33,100
Indeed!

496
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,610
Waqar...

497
00:32:59,626 --> 00:33:00,676
Hello?

498
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:01,772
Jiya.

499
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,211
You there yet?

500
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:04,856
I'm on the way.

501
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:06,501
I'm home.

502
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:08,921
Will you call tonight?

503
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:11,158
Yes, maybe...

504
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:12,980
Maybe?

505
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:14,633
Why?

506
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,076
I think I'll talk to you tomorrow.

507
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:18,376
Okay?

508
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,580
Okay.

509
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,516
Bye.

510
00:33:20,516 --> 00:33:21,926
Bye.

511
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,350
11

512
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,630
12

513
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,759
13

514
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,990
14

515
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,040

516
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,910
16

517
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,805
17

518
00:33:39,805 --> 00:33:41,000
18

519
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,339

520
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,679
20

521
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,919
21

522
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:45,889
22

523
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:47,112
23

524
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,809
24

525
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,722
25.

526
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,836
Wali! You scared me!

527
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,886
Had the sweet?

528
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,808
I did!

529
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,410
Congratulations!

530
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:18,381
For what?

531
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:22,440
The Foxy's yours from now on!

532
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,931
What?

533
00:34:30,303 --> 00:34:31,457
Wali!

534
00:34:31,457 --> 00:34:34,006
What will I do with the Foxy?

535
00:34:35,118 --> 00:34:37,201
Ask Neelam about it

536
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,387
Or Mum.

537
00:34:38,387 --> 00:34:40,906
They've sealed the deal together.

538
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,278
They've purchased it?

539
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,707
100%!

540
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,720
Suraiyya!

541
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,202
Mum!

542
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:56,177
Come with me.

543
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,052
What happened?

544
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:58,792
Come.

545
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:01,689
Tell me, what is it?

546
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:16,826
Tell me what is it!

547
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:18,516
Sit down.

548
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:23,522
Why did you purchase the Foxy?

549
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,736
Foxy?

550
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:26,746
Neelam just fed me a sweet.

551
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:30,776
And Wali says it's about the purchase of the Foxy!

552
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:38,580
If you'd all come to know that we'd stolen the Foxy

553
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,840
Then --

554
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,919
We could've --

555
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,509
Just returned it quietly.

556
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:44,370
But please.

557
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,020
Don't make a mistake by purchasing it.

558
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,414
It's a lurgy!

559
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,660
Mum!

560
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,619
Wali told her we've purchased the Foxy!

561
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:09,650
The sweet has triggered her anger!

562
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,540
I'm in for it...

563
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:35,020
Tell me honestly

564
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,308
What's the matter with the Foxy?

565
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:38,737
Why is Mum tittering like that?

566
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:42,601
And what was this sweet I've just eaten for?

567
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,737
If I tell you the truth --

568
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:46,337
Something might just explode.

569
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,270
It will if you don't, too.

570
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:51,081
Oh?

571
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:57,241
A deal about you and the Foxy's owner has been sealed.

572
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:59,282
What?

573
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:01,031
Calm down.

574
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:03,323
You're flaring up.

575
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,610
25 gee right here.

576
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,770
Now hand us our cut.

577
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:16,901
Here's your 25,000!

578
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,510
We don't want a penny of it!

579
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,552
And don't eat this sweet.

580
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,581
It's bitter.

581
00:37:25,173 --> 00:37:28,143
Your Foxy is parked on our porch.

582
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Come and collect it.

583
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,080
Munshi Alam!

584
00:38:26,322 --> 00:38:28,096
Who was this girl?

585
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,257
That

586
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:31,320
Was Maheen.

587
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,510
She's not changed one bit.

588
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:42,649
