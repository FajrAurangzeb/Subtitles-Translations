1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,360
This last will and testament is hereby recorded as decreed

2
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,142
Copies of the will

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,220
Shall be sent to each heritor today

4
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,780
To be signed by them.

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,620
Should they have any opposition

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,991
They shall have fifteen days to express the same.

7
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:48,662
Else, this bequest will be assumed to have been accepted as just and fair.

8
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:51,461
Aye.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,930
That's right.

10
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,541
Ammi Begum...

11
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,880
Madam, please sign here.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,670
Look.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,031
Munshi Alam has arrived too.

14
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,150
Madam, we require your thumb impression here.

19
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,299
Thanks.

20
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:08,720
Sir?

21
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,175
My car's not starting.

22
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,852
Car?

23
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,479
The banger's a Foxy.

24
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,810
Aye,

25
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,383
It's a Foxy.

26
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:24,165
But you're saying it's a car.

27
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:26,996
Is it not a car to you?

28
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:28,526
Come on, bro.

29
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:30,087
A Foxy's a Foxy.

30
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,817
Not a car.

31
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,141
Come, mate.

32
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,839
Hey!

33
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,411
If it isn't Gulrez's Foxy!

34
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,329
How come she's alone out here?

35
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,950
Oi!

36
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,680
Where's your husband?

37
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,100
Looks like they had a domestic.

38
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,420
Still, who abandons the pride of the family on the streets like this?

39
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,590
Splendid.

40
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:16,260
This Foxy is parked right in the middle of the road,

41
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,773
And Gulrez is nowhere to be seen.

42
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,950
Oh God!

43
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,371
What am I witnessing here?

44
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,660
Such immodesty, Maheen!

45
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,103
Arthritis.

46
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,421
Arthritis?

47
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,152
Pain in the knee joints.

48
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:32,103
Unable to move any further, she would've said to Gulrez,

49
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,643
'End of the line, mate'!

50
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
Get the rope.

51
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,971
I swear, Wali,

52
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,501
She worked just fine when we left.

53
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:57,182
Ran smoothly as if waltzing.

54
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,132
When I

55
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:00,883
Stopped at the traffic signal,

56
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,783
I thought I heard something.

57
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:06,454
She worked fine again

58
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:08,459
But

59
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,480
Barely moved another hundred yards.

60
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,060
Mind if I say something?

61
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,660
It is time.

62
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:31,261
Time for what?

63
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,871
I mean, be done with it.

64
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,781
Look at her age and resilience.

65
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:39,335
Tell me honestly,

66
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,965
What else do you expect from her?

67
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,295
Put it plainly

68
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,275
What are you trying to say?
-Sell it.

69
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,525
Sell the Foxy?

70
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:50,601
Okay, don't.

71
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,232
How's this?

72
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,542
Park it on the porch

73
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,302
Adorn it with a garland

74
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,810
And bathe it with rose water everyday. But please,

75
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,390
Get a new car to drive to office.

76
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,720
Accursed be the new car.

77
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,661
Just to show people like you,

78
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,352
I cannot sell the one I've loved for fifteen years.

79
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,070
No.

80
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:15,685
Never.

81
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,420
Stop the car.

82
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,590
Stop the car, please.

83
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,470
Where did she vanish?

84
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,840
You mean the Foxy?

85
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,260
Of course, Wali.

86
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,426
Who else could I mean?

87
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:59,061
Where did you park it?

88
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,143
Right here.

89
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,312
No.

90
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,001
You're forgetting something.

91
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:09,723
You're so worried you're unable to remember correctly; think harder.

92
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,602
Think harder about what?

93
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:14,102
I left her right here

94
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:15,303
One hundred percent.

95
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:16,914
At this very spot --

96
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,475
Look!

97
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,505
Tire marks!

98
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,731
Has this happened before?

99
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:24,572
How --

100
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:27,093
You left her and she drove off?

101
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,634
Fantastic, Wali.

102
00:10:28,634 --> 00:10:30,760
How can she drive off on her own?

103
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,100
She couldn't walk one inch from this spot.

104
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,409
That means it's been stolen.

105
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,661
Have you, ever in your life,

106
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:42,151
Heard or read that someone's Foxy got stolen?

107
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:44,834
Thieves are getting innovative these days.

108
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,260
Who knows?

109
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,872
Someone might've taken a liking to it!

110
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,890
How much would it fetch?

111
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,160
What do you mean, 'fetch'?

112
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:58,451
The thief, after all,

113
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:01,281
Does not intend to use it as a rooster coop, yes?

114
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,871
Look, Wali...

115
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,610
You don't understand my feelings.

116
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,401
<i>Everybody</i> understands your feelings.

117
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,252
Neelam says

118
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,981
One just needs to witness your relationship with your Foxy

119
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:18,341
To understand how you would treat your wife.

120
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,782
The police station. Right now.

121
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,571
♪ <i>Haul on the bo'lin!</i> ♪

122

125
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,630
That's it!

126
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,111
Alright.

127
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,530
What next?

128
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,604
What happens next in your average kidnapping case?

129
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,138
You'll collect a ransom from him?

130
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,442
Why not?

131
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:49,680
Put a sock in it!

132
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,211
The chap's a miser.

133
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,881
He'll weep out of sorrow,

134
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,142
But won't give a penny.

135
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,672
In that case...

136
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:01,674
This Foxy stays here for the next hundred years.

137
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,610
Hello?

138
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,429
Yes, we're headed to the police station.

139
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:16,861
What happened?

140
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,778
Thieving rascal.

141
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:21,372
He's going to die by Gulrez's hand.

142
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:23,923
'Thieving rascal'? What are you talking about?

143
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,153
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

144
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,583
Oh God!

145
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:29,439
Don't stop at 'Oh God'.

146
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:31,685
Thank you, O God!

147
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,660
Just pray that it's found.

148
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,863
May it <i>never</i> be found!

149
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,813
I gotta hang up...

150
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,981
You were talking to Neelam?

151
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,350
Yes.

152
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,850
Why did she say, 'Oh God'?

153
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,590
She, uh... Was worried.

154
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:03,010
She exclaimed, 'Oh God' when she heard about it.

155
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,550
Deep down, she loves Foxy too.

156
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:13,901
Aye...

157
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,490
Peace be upon you, Uncle Munshi!

158
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,792
Peace be upon you!

159
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,073
Munshi Uncle, catch the keys.

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,807
Peace be upon you, Auntie!

161
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,447
And upon you, peace.

162
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,207
And it's not 'Auntie;' say 'aintín'.

163
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,278
She'll be scornful about it if she heard it.

164
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:48,348
Where is she?

165
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:50,138
Praying.

166
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,269
Right,

167
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,730
Mr Gulrez!

168
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,760
What colour is your car?

169
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,671
Sir...

170
00:14:04,671 --> 00:14:05,742
Maroon.

171
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,583
Maroon...

172
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,580
Model?

173
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,510
1966.

174
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,731
19

175
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,602
196

176
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,867
1966...

177
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:26,048
Mind if I say something?

178
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,301
Not at all?

179
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:30,081
Don't file a complaint for theft.

180
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,722
Why?

181
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:35,322
Such an old car isn't getting stolen.

182
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:40,674
Then what might have happened to her?

183
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,501
Leave it be.

184
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:45,853
Tell me, did it work?

185
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:47,804
Work?

186
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,411
What?

187
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,809
You don't need to ask.

188
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,679
She's in great shape!

189
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,900
With the attitude of a viscountess!

190
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,400
Just sometimes --

191
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,915
Sometimes -- ?

192
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,750
Whenever she'd stop working,

193
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,241
I'd tow her to the workshop with Wali's car.

194
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,921
And the address of the workshop?

195
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,450
She sure ain't going there by herself...

196
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,750
You never know, my good sir...

197
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,710
If only we knew what surprise awaits...

198
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,511
Don't worry, though.

199
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,951
You're at the right place.

200
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,621
Never thought

201
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,351
I'd have to come <i>here</i>

202
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,381
Because of her.

203
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,599
Wait, Maheen.

204
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,710
My first benediction in orison is for you,

205
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,223
And a prayer that you pay a visit precedes it.

206
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:17,986
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

207
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,459
It kills me to hear that!

208
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,090
Poor Gulrez.

209
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,910
Poor thief.

210
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,800
What will he do with it?

211
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,530
Umm...

212
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,380
If the right compensation isn't received,

213
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,700
Set it ablaze by the shore!

214
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,840
What do you mean?

215
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,820
The thief

216
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,500
Is right here!

217
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,330
Don't do it, love, the poor lad will die.

218
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,851
I'll return it before he dies!

219
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,650
But however did you manage to steal the Foxy?

220
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,180
It's not as if it's a matchbox.

221
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,210
Just think, Nano, as if

222
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,821
The Foxy is inside a matchbox!

223
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:06,621
But

224
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,881
You have to promise me...

225
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,914
Yeah?

226
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,823
You haven't the foggiest about the Foxy.

227
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:15,890
I mean

228
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,791
You don't know about the theft

229
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,512
Or

230
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,063
The thief.

231
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,531
Hold your horses...

232
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:28,491
Let me get up from this holy spot.

233
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:35,233
You have to promise me, too...

234
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,031
What?

235
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,470
You

236
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,580
Will only inflict as much torment as the poor man can bear.

237
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,061
Then you don't know, Nano.

238
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:51,740
He's not beggarly. The only poverty that afflicts him is related to pluck!

239
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,231
And his breed of destitutes get a strike

240
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,380
Where there's not the slightest relief.

241
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,541
Step aside.

242
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:01,113
Blabbering on and on and --

243
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,102
Alright.

244
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,700
I'll strike him where he'll have only the slightest relief.

245
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,081
Listen!

246
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:10,644
Tell me

247
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,849
Where have you kept the poor thing?

248
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,470
In a

249
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,725
Matchbox!

250
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,655
Oh Gulrez...!

251
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,940
Tell me about the tyres.

252
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,291
What do you mean?

253
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,480
Tell me the age.

254
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,651
When did you last replace them?

255
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:50,932
Around -- four months ago?

256
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,182
Wow...

257
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,230
I'm sure the tyres were <i>most</i> alluring!

258
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,111
Allur -- What?

259
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,979
You won't get it, Mr Gulrez.

260
00:19:02,979 --> 00:19:07,360
Tell me - did you have a tape deck in it?

261
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,404
Why not?

262
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,400
Plus, I change it every year.

263
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,691
Elementary!

264
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,271
What?

265
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,931
Case closed.

266
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:23,401
Rest assured, gentlemen!

267
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,850
Leave it to us.

268
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,083
You'll find it by the time we're done resting, yes?

269
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:32,991
How many hours do you sleep?

270
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,240
Oh sir...

271
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,210
Who'll be able to sleep now?

272
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,614
No, Mr Gulrez...

273
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:45,772
Having a nice and peaceful sleep is very important.

274
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,780
Hey girl!

275
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,760
Have something before you leave?

276
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,010
If I have something here, will I just stare at people eating at Neelam's birthday party?

277
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,460
No, young lady.

278
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,852
Something else is going on...

279
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,770
What could it be?

280
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,179
Hmm...

281
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,820
The redness on your cheeks suggests...

282
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,366
You've been leeching someone's blood.

283
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,631
Suspicion

284
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,801
Suspicion is the pair of scissors that cuts the threads of affection.

285
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,761
It has already snipped, my dear...

286
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,680
It'll be clear within a few hours who's been struck.

287
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,791
Let me know when it's clear to you!

288
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,780
Bye!

289
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,539
Hey!

290
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,659
Tell Mum that Dastoor Ahmed will be late.

291
00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:34,681
He'll take me and Mum along with him.

292
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,170
Only you!

293
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,394
Why?

294
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,081
Nano's coming with us!

295
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,833
Fajr!

296
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,728
Fajr!

297
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,570
She's stolen

298
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,049
Gulrez's Foxy.

299
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,890
You've found out?

300
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,891
She told me about her latest exploit herself!

301
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:25,115
She had me promise not to tell anyone!

302
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,584
Ehh?

303
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,592
She had me promise too.

304
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,600
But I've just reneged on it.

305
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,934
I'm honestly worried, Ammi Begum.

306
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,854
Why are you worried?

307
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,854
She may create a scene over it.

308
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,571
Don't worry...

309
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,050
I used to fight such battles with your father.

310
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,380
Dad used to say,

311
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,371
'This girl never fails to ruffle Siraj Ahmed'.

312
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,171
And see,

313
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,733
At the age of 60 years,

314
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,871
He departed after 120 years of life.

315
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,392
In his last moments,

316
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:15,191
He seized my hand and said,

317
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:20,154
'No idea why I'd cower before you, Kaneez Begum'...

318
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:23,074
Do you want me to ask her?

319
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,811
Don't you dare!

320
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,670
Don't even say a word.

321
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,611
Let me handle the talking.

322
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:33,080
She'll be going to the birthday party with me in the evening.

323
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,780
I'll ask her on the way.

324
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:39,834
Ask her when the car is moving slowly.

325
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,490
Or stopped at a traffic signal.

326
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,990
Why?

327
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,230
Just --

328
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,651
Dad used to say, 'Drive neither in excessive sorrow nor in ebullience'.

329
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,061
She's here.

330
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:55,791
Alright, hang up.

331
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,343
Don't tell her

332
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,824
I mentioned the theft.

333
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,801
Who were you talking to?

334
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,322
Ammi Begum.

335
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:12,762
You told her?

336
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:16,403
Of course not; we didn't even talk about the Foxy.

337
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,121
She was just asking me what I'd wear to the birthday party.

338
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:22,121
And what'd you wear?

339
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:24,681
I'm thinking

340
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,710
Of a pink sari...

341
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:28,088
That's great!

342
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:31,201
You're really decking up for Neelam's birthday.

343
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:34,416
Don't forget to pack the black dress.

344
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,785
Why?

345
00:23:35,785 --> 00:23:38,266
Who knows if there'll be cause for celebration at all!

346
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:39,166
Why not?

347
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,176
He's got such a puny heart, Mum.

348
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:44,200
Who knows, it may just go boom at the mention of the ransom!

349
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,040
How much will you demand?

350
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,751
Just about a 100-150 grand or so.

351
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,173
What?

352
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:51,202
Are you in your senses?

353
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:53,171
If you ask for a hundred grand, he won't give you.

354
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,531
He'll give you his head.

355
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,741
By God!

356
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:57,371
What a spectacle will that be!

357
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:01,752
For the first time, a man will give his head for a Foxy!

358
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,563
Then I'll write in my diary,

359
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:06,084
'I've never seen such a one as you, Gulrez Akhtar',

360
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,615
'You're not dead';

361
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,606
'You're a martyr'!

362
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,580
Go.

363
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,830
Careful!

364
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,900
Need any help?

365
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,470
Please, enjoy the party.

366
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,930
Have you no shame, Wali Ahmed?

367
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,580
Keep on serving her with such sobreity

368
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,250
And you might just end up dancing to her tunes forever!

369
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,670
You know well enough, Aunt Mehru.

370
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,391
If I am able to dance to her tunes,

371
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:45,102
I'd be greatly honoured.

372
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,242
Oh?

373
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:48,344
So that's what you desire!

374
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:51,144
At my friend's mehendi [wedding ritual]

375
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:52,796
She was in the mood for a presto

376
00:24:52,796 --> 00:24:55,817
I couldn't even keep up with the rhythm.

377
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:59,370
You're so indecorous!

378
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,030
Stay tuned for more!

379
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:06,760
Hey!

380
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,960
Congratulations to you...

381
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,331
You've got a terpsichorean for a husband!

382
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:14,971
Congratulate her, Aunt!

383
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:19,242
It's not necessary for everything to go with the rhythm!

384
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,110
You haven't asked, Nano,

385
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,139
Why I've brought petals along with the bouquet.

386
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,190
I know.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,960
Yes, that's why you're our friend.

388
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,851
You're so intelligent.

389
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:40,050
Why the petals, Dado?

390
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:46,712
This buffon has a feeling that he'd die of sorrow on hearing about the Foxy.

391
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:51,477
And she'll shower these petals on his body.

392
00:25:51,477 --> 00:25:52,692
Oh my God!

393
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,283
That will ruin the birthday celebrations!

394
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:56,913
Never mind <i>that</i>!

395
00:25:56,913 --> 00:25:59,303
Tell me Maheen,

396
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:04,384
If you're married off to someone like him --

397
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,739
Life will come to a standstill like this, Nano!

398
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,919
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!

399
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:40,515
Why are you speaking English?

400
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:43,845
Because Ammi Begum isn't around!

401
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,404
Peace be upon you, Dastoor Uncle!

402
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,180
And upon you, peace!

403
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,610
Thank you!

404
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,401
Welcome.

405
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,764
Cutting the cake will have to wait four hours.

406
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,750
Why, Uncle?

407
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,600
A bit of a problem.

408
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,041
By the way, where's Ammi Begum?

409
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,992
Aye, m'lad?

410
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:06,461
What do you want from your Ammi Begum?

411
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:08,191
Happy Birthday!

412
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,780
Thank you!

413
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,240
Happy Birthday!

414
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,170
Thank you!

415
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,499
Before you arrived, Ammi Begum,

416
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:36,620
He was speaking English!

417
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,731
I will today. Defiantly if I have to.

418
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,431
Hold your tongue, Dastoor Ahmed.

419
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:06,721
You getting thwacked at this age isn't going to look nice.

420
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:08,472
I've brought news

421
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:11,088
I will break it after four hours.

422
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,940
Tell me right now.

423
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,750
I can tell you in English right now, if that's what you want...

424
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,100
Alright...

425
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:21,721
Come back in four hours.

426
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:23,302
Come.

427
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,889
Where's Gulrez?

428
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:30,852
The colleen's in mourning.

429
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:32,593
Mourning?

430
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:35,583
His Foxy's been stolen.

431
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:38,354
What kind of fool has stolen it?

432
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:39,886
Don't say it so loud.

433
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,987
He'll start wailing.

434
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,060
Anyway, where is he?

435
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,481
Perhaps it's not been stolen.

436
00:28:46,481 --> 00:28:48,232
It's been stolen.

437
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:51,173
It could've been abducted.

438
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,529
Abducted?

439
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,751
Just tell me...

440
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:56,862
If you have to pay 25 gee as compensation,

441
00:28:56,862 --> 00:29:00,086
Can you make this little sacrifice for your Foxy?

442
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,800
Who's collecting it?

443
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,371
No one -- Just... Asking.

444
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,943
I can do anything for my Foxy.

445
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,732
But --

446
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,735
25 gee is a bit too much.

447
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,860
Your love is hollow!

448
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,884
It's nothing like that.

449
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:23,032
I just don't have the dough --

450
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:24,732
Fibster!

451
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,560
(Aunt Suraiyya...)

452
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:29,291
(Over there...)

453
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,683
(Say it before they do, please?)

454
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,791
(That Gulrez is Maheen's?)

455
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,591
(What?)

456
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:38,582
(Gulrez is Maheen's.)

457
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,423
(Please say it.)

458
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,242
(Alright.)

459
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:44,553
(Maheen is Gulrez's.)

460
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,340
Shh!

461
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,552
The weather ain't bad.

462
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,296
Okay,

463
00:30:36,296 --> 00:30:37,640
See you soon!

464
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,750
How long are you here?

465
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,710
No idea.

466
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,439
Well, I'll see you soon then!

467
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,671
Alright.

468
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,480
Let's meet again soon then. Bye.

469
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,880
Bye!

470
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,959
Munshi Alam!

471
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,572
You look so old!

472
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,970
Not a penny less than 25 gee.

473
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,680
Where's the car?

474
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,153
The Foxy - not the car.

475
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,633
And we don't know where it is.

476
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,290
But we can look for it for you.

477
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,840
Alright.

478
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,324
Deal.

479
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,149
Place 25 gee on Fajr's palm.

480
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,540
I will give it when the Foxy is found.

481
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,331
Bucks before it works!

482
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,371
Don't you trust me?

483
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:32,651
Not at all.

484
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,432
Have this sweet, quickly.

485
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:37,542
What's the occasion?

486
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,491
Not trusting him!

487
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,974
We'll have one too, then.

488
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,350
Sure.

489
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,689
Here.

490
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,512
And you too.

491
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,740
Alright, tell me in English.

492
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,081
Tell you what?

493
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,643
What's the news?

494
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:04,092
Oh --

495
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,070
Say it quickly.

496
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,570
Waqar Ahmed is coming.

497
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,130
Wa --

498
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,735
Waq --

499
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,200
Waqar Ahmed!

500
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,579
I'd die of happiness, Dastoor Ahmed!

501
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,470
That's why

502
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,420
That's why I had said

503
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,286
That I'd say it in English.

504
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,181
Indeed!

505
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,540
Waqar...

506
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,470
Hello?

507
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,654
Jiya.

508
00:33:01,654 --> 00:33:02,974
You there yet?

509
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:04,755
I'm on the way.

510
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,616
I'm home.

511
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:08,725
Will you call tonight?

512
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:11,056
Aye, maybe...

513
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,801
Maybe?

514
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,581
Why?

515
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:16,902
I think I'll talk to you tomorrow.

516
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:18,212
Okay?

517
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:19,462
Okay.

518
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,457
Bye.

519
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,913
Bye.

520
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,299
11...

521
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:34,590
12...

522
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,744
13...

523
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,870
14...

524
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,930
15...

525
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,751
16...

526
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,641
17...

527
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,973
18...

528
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,222
19...

529
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,473
20...

530
00:33:43,473 --> 00:33:44,784
21...

531
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:45,870
22...

532
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,039
23...

533
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,671
24...

534
00:33:48,671 --> 00:33:50,272
25!

535
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,229
(Wali!)

536
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:02,149
(You made me jump!)

537
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:09,721
(Had the sweet?)

538
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,871
(I did!)

539
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,428
(Congratulations!)

540
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,130
(For what?)

541
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,420
(The Foxy's all yours now!)

542
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,851
W -- What?

543
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,340
Wali!

544
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,928
What will I do with the Foxy?

545
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,008
Ask Neelam about it

546
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,249
Or Mum.

547
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:40,670
They've sealed the deal together.

548
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,950
She's bought it?

549
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,561
100%!

550
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,738
(Suraiyya!)

551
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:55,039
Mum!

552
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:55,990
Come with me.

553
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,859
What happened?

554
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,239
Come.

555
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,610
Tell me, what is it?

556
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,698
Care to tell me what it is?

557
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,478
Sit down.

558
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,358
Why did you buy the Foxy?

559
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:24,530
Foxy?

560
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,560
Neelam just fed me a sweet.

561
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,544
And Wali says it's because the Foxy's ours now!

562
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:38,502
If you'd all come to know that we'd stolen the Foxy

563
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:39,692
Then --

564
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:40,722
We could've --

565
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,073
Returned it quietly.

566
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:44,249
But please.

567
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:45,929
Don't make a mistake by buying it.

568
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,910
It's a lurgy!

569
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,542
Mum!

570
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,481
Wali told her we've bought the Foxy!

571
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:09,450
The sweet has triggered her temper!

572
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,300
(I'm in for it...)

573
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:33,668
*Hem*

574
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:34,868
Honestly...

575
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:36,968
What's the matter with the Foxy?

576
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:38,680
Why is Mum tittering like that?

577
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,979
And what was this sweet I've just eaten for?

578
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:44,410
If I tell you the truth --

579
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,100
Something might just explode.

580
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,788
It will if you don't, too.

581
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:50,815
Alright, then...

582
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,347
A deal about you and the Foxy's owner has been sealed.

583
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:58,657
What?

584
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,988
Calm down.

585
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:03,069
You're flaring up.

586
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,440
25 gee right here.

587
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,561
Hand us our cut.

588
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,730
Here's your blasted 25,000!

589
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,004
We don't want a penny of it!

590
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,450
And don't eat this sweet.

591
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,047
It's bitter.

592
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:27,699
Your Foxy is parked on our porch.

593
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:30,590
Come and get it.

594
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,758
Munshi Alam!

595
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:27,732
Who was that?

596
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,029
That

597
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:30,991
Was Maheen.

598
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,980
She hasn't changed one bit.

599
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
