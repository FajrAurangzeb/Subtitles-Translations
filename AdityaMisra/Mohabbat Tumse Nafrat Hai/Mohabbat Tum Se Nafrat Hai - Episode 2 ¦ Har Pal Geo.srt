1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This last will and testament is hereby recorded as decreed

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Copies of the will

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shall be sent to each heritor today

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To be signed by them.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Should they have any opposition

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They shall have fifteen days to express the same.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Else, this bequest will be assumed to have been accepted as just and fair.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's right.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Madam, please sign here.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam has arrived too.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Madam, we require your thumb impression here.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked for</i>

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and throws them from the eyes</i>

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>What good is grieving and writhing in your name?</i>

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sir?

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My car's not starting.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Car?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The banger's a Foxy.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a Foxy.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're saying it's a car.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is it not a car to you?

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on, bro.

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A Foxy's a Foxy.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a car.

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, mate.

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is Gulrez's Foxy.

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How come it's alone out here?

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's your husband?

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Probably had a domestic.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even then, the pride of the family is not to be abandoned on the streets like this.

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Splendid.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This Foxy is parked right in the middle of the road,

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Gulrez is nowhere to be seen.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh God!

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What am I witnessing here?

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such immodesty, Maheen!

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arthritis.

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Arthritis?

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Pain in the knee joints.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unable to move any further, she'd have said to Gulrez Bhai,

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'End of the line, mate'!

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take out the rope.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, Wali

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She worked just fine when I left.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ran smoothly as if waltzing.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stopped at the traffic signal,

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I heard something.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She worked fine again

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Barely moved another hundred yards.

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I say something?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is time.

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Time for what?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, be done with it.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at her age and resilience.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me honestly,

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else do you expect from her?

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put it plainly

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you trying to say?
-Sell it.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sell the Foxy?

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, don't sell it.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let it be this way:

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Park it on the porch

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Adorn it with a garland

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And shower rose petals on it.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please do one thing

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Purchase a new car to drive to office.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Accursed be the new car.

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just to show people like you,

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I cannot sell the one I've loved for fifteen years.

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Never.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop the car.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop the car, please.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where did it vanish?

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You mean the Foxy?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course, Wali.

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else could I mean?

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where did you park it?

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right here.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're forgetting something.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so worried you're unable to remember correctly; think harder.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think harder about what?

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I left her right here

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One hundred percent.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At this very spot --

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look!

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tire marks!

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has this happened before?

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How --

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You left her and she drove off?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fantastic, Wali.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How can she drive off on her own?

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She couldn't walk one inch from this spot.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That means it's been stolen.

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you, ever in your life,

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heard or read that someone's Foxy got stolen?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thieves are getting innovative these days.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One might've taken a liking to it!

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much would it fetch?

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean, 'fetch'?

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The thief, after all

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely does not intend to use it as a rooster coop.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, Wali

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't understand my feelings.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everybody understands your feelings.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam says

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One just needs to witness your relationship with your Foxy

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To understand how you would treat your wife.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the police station.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haul on the bo'lin!

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bo'lin haul!

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Haul on the bo'lin!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The bloody ship's is a-rollin'!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it!

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What now?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That which happens in kidnapping cases.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll collect a ransom from him?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put a sock in it!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chap's a miser.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll weep out of sorrow

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But won't give a penny.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This Foxy stays here for the next hundred years.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, we're headed to the police station.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thieving rascal.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's going to die by Gulrez's hand.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Thieving rascal'? What are you talking about?

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh God!

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say something more than just 'Oh God'.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you, O God!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just pray that it's found.

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May God will that it never be found.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm disconnecting for now.

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You were talking to Neelam?

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did she say, 'Oh God'?

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was worried.

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Exclaimed, 'Oh God' on hearing about it.

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Deep down, she loves Foxy too.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Munshi Uncle!

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you!

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Uncle, catch the keys.

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Auntie!

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace.

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And it's not 'Auntie;' say 'aintín'.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll be scornful about it if she hears it.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where is she?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's praying.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right,

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mr Gulrez!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What colour is your car?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maroon.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maroon...

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Model?

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1966.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1966...

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I say something?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't file a complaint for theft.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Such an old car isn't getting stolen.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then what might have happened to her?

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be.

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, did it work?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Work?

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to ask.

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It works so well

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With the attitude of a viscountess!

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just sometimes --

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes --?

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If it ever stopped working

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd take it to the workshop using Wali's car.

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the address of the workshop?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It sure hasn't gone to the workshop on its own...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can never know, my good sir...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If only we knew what surprise awaits...

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry, though.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're at the right place.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd never thought of it.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd have to come here

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because of her.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop, Maheen.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My first benediction in orison is for you.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And a prayer that you pay a visit precedes it.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's Foxy has been stolen.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It kills me to hear that!

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor Gulrez.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Poor thief.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What will he do with it?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If the right compensation isn't received,

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Set it ablaze by the shore!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The thief

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is none but me.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't do it, the poor lad will die.

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll return it before he dies!

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But however did you manage to steal the Foxy?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not as if it's a matchbox.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think, Nano, as if

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Foxy is inside a matchbox!

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to make a promise to me.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What promise?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't the foggiest about the Foxy.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neither do you know about the theft

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor about the thief.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold up.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, let me get up from this sacred spot.

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have to make a promise too.

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What promise?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will only inflict as much torment as the poor man can bear.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then you don't know, Nano.

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not beggarly.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only poverty that afflicts him is related to pluck!

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And his breed of destitutes get a strike

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where there's not the slightest relief.

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Step aside.

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blabbering on and on and --

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll strike him where he'll have the slightest of relief.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where have you kept the banger?

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a matchbox!

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh Gulrez...!

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me about the tyres.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me the age.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When did you purchase them?

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Around -- four months ago?

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then the tyres can lead one to consider it...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Consider what?

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'll not understand it, Mr Gulrez.

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me - did you have a tape deck in it?

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Plus, I change it every year.

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's it, then!

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's it?

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Case closed.

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Rest assured, gentlemen!

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it to us.

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be found when we're done with our rest, won't it?

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How many hours do you sleep?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh sir...

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'll be able to sleep now?

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Mr Gulrez...

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Having a nice and peaceful sleep is important.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey girl!

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't have anything before you leave?

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I have something here, will I just stare at people eating at Neelam's birthday party?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, young lady.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something else is going on...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What could it be?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The redness on your cheeks suggests...

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've been leeching someone's blood.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suspicion

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suspicion is the pair of scissors that cuts the threads of affection.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It has already snipped, my dear...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be clear within a few hours who's been struck.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me know when it's clear to you!

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen!

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell Mum that Dastoor Ahmed will be late.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll take me and Mum along with him.

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only you!

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano's coming with us!

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr!

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's stolen

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez's Foxy.

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've found out?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She told me about her latest exploit herself!

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had me promise not to tell anyone!

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had me promise too.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I've reneged on it.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm honestly worried, Ammi Begum.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you worried?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She may create a scene over it.

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I used to fight such battles with your father.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad used to say,

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'This girl never fails to ruffle Siraj Ahmed'.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And see,

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At the age of 60 years,

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He departed after 120 years of life.

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In his last moments,

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He seized my hand and said,

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I used to cower before you for nothing, Kaneez Begum'.

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you say, should I ask?

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare!

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even say a word.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me handle the talking.

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'll be going to the birthday party with me in the evening.

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll ask her on the way.

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask her when the car is moving slowly.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or stopped at a traffic signal.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad used to say, 'Drive neither in excessive sorrow nor in ebullience'.

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's here.

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Disconnect the phone.

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't say

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I mentioned the theft.

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who were you talking to?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Ammi Begum.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You told her?

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course not; there was no mention of the Foxy.

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was just asking me what I'd wear for the birthday celebration.

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what will you wear?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm thinking

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of a pink sari...

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's great!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're really decking up for Neelam's birthday.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep the black one as well.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows if there'll be cause for celebration at all!

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got such a puny heart, Mum.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who knows, it may just go boom at the mention of the ransom!

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How much will you demand?

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just about a 100-150 grand or so.

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you in your senses?

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask for a hundred grand, he won't give you.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll give you his head.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By God!

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What a spectacle will that be!

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For the first time, a man will give his head for a Foxy!

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then I'll write in my diary,

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I've not seen such a one as you, Gulrez Akhtar',

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You're not dead; you're a martyr'.

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Careful!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Need any help?

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, enjoy the party.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have you no shame, Wali Ahmed?

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep on serving her with such sobreity

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you might just end up dancing to her tunes forever!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know well enough, Aunt Mehru.

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I am able to dance to her tunes,

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd be greatly honoured.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So that's what you desire!

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At my friend's mehendi [wedding ritual]

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She was in the mood for a presto

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't even keep up with the rhythm.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so indecorous!

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned for more!

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations to you

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've got a terpsichorean for a husband!

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulate her, Aunt!

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not necessary for everything to go with the rhythm!

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You haven't asked, Nano

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why I've brought petals along with the bouquet.

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know.

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, that's why you're our friend.

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're so intelligent.

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why the petals, Dado?

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This buffon has a feeling that he'd die of sorrow on hearing about the Foxy.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she'll shower these petals on his body.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my God!

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This will ruin the birthday celebrations!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave it be!

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me Maheen,

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you're married off to someone like him --

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Life will come to a standstill like this, Nano!

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good evening ladies and gentlemen!

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you speaking English?

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because Ammi Begum isn't around!

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace be upon you, Dastoor Uncle!

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And upon you, peace!

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Welcome.

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cutting the cake will have to wait four hours.

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why, Uncle?

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A bit of a problem.

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way, where's Ammi Begum?

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes?

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you want from Ammi Begum?

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy Birthday!

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy Birthday!

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you!

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Before you arrived, Ammi Begum

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He was speaking English!

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Defiantly, I will today.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hold your tongue, Dastoor Ahmed.

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You getting thwacked at this age isn't going to look nice.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've brought news

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will break it after four hours.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Speak right now.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Right now, I will narrate it in English.

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Break the news after four hours.

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Gulrez?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The colleen's in mourning.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mourning?

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His Foxy's been stolen.

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What kind of fool has stolen it?

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't say it so loud.

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'll start wailing.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyways, where is he?

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps it's not been stolen.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been stolen.

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It could've been abducted.

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Abducted?

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just tell me

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you have to pay 25 gee as compensation,

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Can you make this sacrifice for your Foxy?

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's collecting it?

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm just asking -- so to speak.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can do anything for my Foxy.

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But --

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25 gee is a bit too much.

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your love is not true.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's nothing like that.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just don't have the dough --

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fibster!

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aunt Suraiyya

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look at that.

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it before they do, please?

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Gulrez is Maheen's.

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez is Maheen's.

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please say it.

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen is Gulrez's.

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The weather ain't bad.

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come on.

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
See you soon!

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long are you here?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, I'll see you soon then!

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let's meet again soon then. Bye.

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You look so old!

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not a penny less than 25 gee.

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's the car?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Foxy - not the car.

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we don't know where it is.

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we can look for it for you.

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Deal.

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Place 25 gee on Fajr's palm.

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I will give it when the Foxy is found.

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First, the buck; then we work.

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you trust me?

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not at all.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have this sweet, quickly.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the occasion?

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not trusting him!

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll have one too, then.

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, please.

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have one.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you too.

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, tell me in English.

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell you what?

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the news?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh --

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Say it quickly.

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed is coming.

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wa --

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waq --

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed!

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd die of happiness, Dastoor Ahmed!

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I had said

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'd say it in English.

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Indeed!

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar...

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You there yet?

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm on the way.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm home.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Will you call tonight?

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes, maybe...

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maybe?

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think I'll talk to you tomorrow.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay?

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
11

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
12

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
13

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
14

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
16

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
17

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
18

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
19

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
20

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
21

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
22

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
23

524
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
24

525
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25.

526
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali! You scared me!

527
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had the sweet?

528
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did!

529
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Congratulations!

530
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For what?

531
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The Foxy's yours from now on!

532
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

533
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali!

534
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What will I do with the Foxy?

535
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Neelam about it

536
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or Mum.

537
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've sealed the deal together.

538
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They've purchased it?

539
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
100%!

540
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya!

541
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

542
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come with me.

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

544
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

545
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, what is it?

546
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me what is it!

547
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit down.

548
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you purchase the Foxy?

549
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Foxy?

550
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam just fed me a sweet.

551
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Wali says it's about the purchase of the Foxy!

552
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you'd all come to know that we'd stolen the Foxy

553
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then --

554
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We could've --

555
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just returned it quietly.

556
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But please.

557
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't make a mistake by purchasing it.

558
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a lurgy!

559
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum!

560
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali told her we've purchased the Foxy!

561
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The sweet has triggered her anger!

562
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm in for it...

563
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me honestly

564
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's the matter with the Foxy?

565
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is Mum tittering like that?

566
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what was this sweet I've just eaten for?

567
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I tell you the truth --

568
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Something might just explode.

569
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It will if you don't, too.

570
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh?

571
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A deal about you and the Foxy's owner has been sealed.

572
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

573
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Calm down.

574
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're flaring up.

575
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
25 gee right here.

576
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now hand us our cut.

577
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's your 25,000!

578
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We don't want a penny of it!

579
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't eat this sweet.

580
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's bitter.

581
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Foxy is parked on our porch.

582
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come and get it.

583
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam!

584
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who was this girl?

585
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That

586
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was Maheen.

587
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not changed one bit.

588
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
