1
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,929
C'mon, now, you illywhacker... Put it on her.

2
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,218
Give him your hand already, my girl.

3
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,458
Where's Waqar?

4
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:30,639
He just left.

5
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,268
Where?

6
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,361
Back where he'd come from.

7
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:59,881
His flight leaves at 2 a.m.

8
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,738
Hello?

9
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,931
You're leaving?

10
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,822
Maheen?

11
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,208
I asked if you're leaving.

12
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,084
Got engaged?

13
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,839
Stop the car!

14
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:35,191
Stop the car.

15
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,678
Don't go anywhere, Waqar...

16
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,288
For my sake...

17
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,838
Don't leave me in here...

18
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,828
I want to tell you something...

19
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,358
Especially you, Nano...

20
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:50,438
I think... I want to tell you, Nano...

21
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,724
But I want everyone else to know...

22
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,921
When you get us engaged as kids...

23
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,312
We're too young...

24
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,891
Too young to know what it means...

25
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:23,531
What we eat, when we sleep - You decide everything.

26
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,657
We eat even when we're not hungry.

27
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:32,608
Doze off even when we're not sleepy...

28
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,900
We're so stupid we skive off school for fun...

29
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,853
We realise later that school's more important.

30
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:53,370
We pray that our teachers get hurt,

31
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,480
Or the city rises up in an insurrection,

32
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,431
Without a care for the living or the dead... We just want the school to close down!

33
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,068
But these wishes, these curses...

34
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:11,388
They don't really mean anything.

35
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,848
We know what death is.

36
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:22,333
We know death

37
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,828
As a moment of sorrow and mourning.

38
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:29,009
But we don't know

39
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:31,759
What it means to die...

40
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,850
Our life's without any logic.

41
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,950
Fighting for no reason,

42
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,478
Making peace for no reason...

43
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,918
I've heard

44
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:51,579
I was 10

45
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,597
When you got me engaged to Gulrez.

46
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,878
I'm sure you told me...

47
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:59,608
I must've been delighted and agreed.

48
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,031
But...

49
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,842
Did any of you ever think

50
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,749
Why I was so happy I agreed?

51
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,138
Who knows, I might just be thinking

52
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:20,468
That engagements and weddings are more excuses to skive off school!

53
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,616
I'm sure you're all wondering

54
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,932
Why I had to accept it

55
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,341
Just to refuse on the day of the engagement.

56
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,160
In truth...

57
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,300
I've been fighting myself

58
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,629
Until the moment I put on the ring and refused...

59
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,089
I wanted to sacrifice myself for your happiness.

60
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,969
But I lost as the clock struck 12.

61
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,320
My heart, which used to celebrate another day off

62
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,201
10 years ago,

63
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,628
Started beating for someone.

64
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,358
I'm sorry, Neelam...

65
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,202
But it isn't Gulrez.

66
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,658
So it's <i>you</i>...

67
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,129
Maheen's old man... You blighter!

68
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,938
You charred three lives in the searing flames of your desires,

69
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,369
Only to die and escape everything! How convenient!

70
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,168
What'd you think?

71
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,498
Your sins would die with you?

72
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,788
That the record of your sins would be buried with you?

73
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,198
No, Aurangzeb! No...

74
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,578
No...

75
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,601
Your generations

76
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,931
Have to pay for it

77
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,720
Until every score

78
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:37,361
Has been settled!

79
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,018
HEAR ME IF YOU CAN!

80
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,848
Don't...

81
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,621
Don't cower in your grave thinking

82
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:14,251
That everyone will forget the seeds you've sown now that you're dust.

83
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,459
Sins are debts, Aurangzeb! DEBTS!

84
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,989
Sins are debts, Aurangzeb.

85
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,210
And the debts of the father

86
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,685
Are to be laid

87
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:08,740
Upon the children.

88
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,288
AURANGZEB!

89
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,141
Dastoor Ahmed! Go and tell him if he's upstairs

90
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:56,330
That Ammi Begum ain't going away so quickly!

91
00:19:56,992 --> 00:20:02,483
He better not set foot here until I'm dead!

92
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,138
GO!

93
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,128
I knew in the morning what was going to happen tonight...

94
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,128
Do you know how?

95
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:21,908
I had to go somewhere in the afternoon.

96
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:25,878
My Foxy refused to start...

97
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,350
I was like, 'Jesus Christ, mate'...

98
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,678
'You're gonna kill me today'.

99
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,201
For many years now,

100
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:48,790
That's how

101
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,071
She's told me to stop.

102
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,318
That's her signal.

103
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,078
That's how I know

104
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,188
That it's not the day.

105
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:10,568
I knew by the afternoon.

106
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:21,438
But I thought the day would change by midnight, when I'd get engaged...

107
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:26,728
Hoped, perhaps, that so would my fate...

108
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,919
But Nano...

109
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:39,438
She's always in a hurry.

110
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,788
She didn't even wait until midnight.

111
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,308
Comforting won't make this sorrow vanish into thin air.

112
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:38,348
It isn't a cure either

113
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,518
That'd work like a spell on your pat.

114
00:24:45,238 --> 00:24:46,829
If you ask me,

115
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:49,680
I'm honoured.

116
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,280
I mean,

117
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,709
Just think of it this way...

118
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,108
She's confident

119
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,338
That I can take it.

120
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,878
Go and comfort the one

121
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,978
Who's suffering in someone else's sorrow.

122
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,361
He needs it more than me.

123
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,049
He didn't come here, Ammi Begum.

124
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,348
How will he?

125
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:11,709
Who could he look in the eye?

126
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,068
Please sit, Ammi Begum.

127
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,209
Cool down and think over it.

128
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:23,929
I'm a blimmin' fireball right now and you want me to cool down?

129
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:27,110
Get it through to him!

130
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,700
He better leave the country! Or the city at the very least!

131
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,268
I better not see him while I'm alive!

132
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,708
Jeez...

133
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:37,378
'Jeez'?

134
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,939
What do you mean?

135
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:42,500
You're pushing yourself, Ammi Begum.

136
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,718
He's here after ages.

137
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:50,618
Remember your prayers?

138
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:54,610
All wasted as far as I care, Dastoor Ahmed.

139
00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:04,919
Now, I pray that I hear the rotter's landed in London.

140
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,420
That's what I think...

141
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,908
He would've landed by tomorrow.

142
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:14,814
I'm sure he'd think about the family's honour... And your order.

143
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,938
He isn't going, Dastoor Ahmed...

144
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:26,078
Maheen's silence was enough to stop him.

145
00:27:28,528 --> 00:27:33,328
And now the twit's called out to him.

146
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,628
Come.

147
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,411
Remember this place? From your Mum and Dad's last days?

148
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:57,770
Oh, I almost miss the Saturday nights, the Sunday mornings! So lively...

149
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:13,734
Not to mention the cricket matches in the lawn. In the floodlights!

150
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:18,500
Ammi Begum used to bowl too!

151
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,821
Your Mum and Dad stayed in this room when they were here.

152
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:29,150
I'm sure it's a bit dusty... It's only cleaned once a year.

153
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:34,790
And the spiderwebs! But don't worry...

154
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,870
I'll have it cleaned.

155
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,573
That's okay, Munshi Alam... But what next?

156
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,278
Dado would be furious.

157
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:47,009
That's why I brought you here.

158
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,359
I've saved your life, so to speak.

159
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,829
What do you mean?

160
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:55,129
She'd kill me if she saw me?

161
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:57,423
I wouldn't rule that out.

162
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,985
You don't know how much she loves me.

163
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:04,309
I did... Until yesterday evening.

164
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,108
No idea now.

165
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:12,979
And the food... What about the food? I don't think anyone would deliver anything here.

166
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:17,240
Don't worry while I'm here.

167
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:20,860
Just think about how long you're staying here.

168
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,900
What do you mean?

169
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,000
It's best for you that you leave.

170
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,418
Leave?

171
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,079
Why?

172
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:43,718
It ain't easy to take up arms against Ammi Begum.

173
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,748
Wait in the lounge outside while I clean the room.

174
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,778
Munshi Alam...

175
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:56,368
Mind if I ask something?

176
00:29:57,878 --> 00:30:00,228
It wasn't right, was it?

177
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,555
Yeah...

178
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,268
She's been Gulrez's fiancée for years.

179
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,008
We never thought she wouldn't marry him.

180
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:25,678
And we had absolutely no idea she'd refuse right on the day of the engagement!

181
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,299
I'm sorry...

182
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,939
Sorry?

183
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:34,629
You're sorry about something?

184
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:37,369
Aye.

185
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,839
You don't love Maheen?

186
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,691
Don't you love Maheen?

187
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,321
I do.

188
00:30:52,381 --> 00:30:55,601
Why are you sorry, then?

189
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:58,461
Wait in the lawn.

190
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,848
Okay.

191
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,808
You want to read my diary?

192
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:40,098
No. Why would I? I thought it'd wake you up.

193
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,212
Is Mum up?

194
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,878
Scared?

195
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,970
I'm scared because she's worried.

196
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,018
Did you talk to him?

197
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,149
Who?

198
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,298
The one you asked to not go anywhere.

199
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:10,708
Did he leave?

200
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:16,048
Do you think he'd leave for any English rose in the world?

201
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,308
Nano would fill him with lead.

202
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,338
What about you?

203
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,100
I don't think she'd even consider me worth aiming a gun at...

204
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,628
Fall at her feet when you see her.

205
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:37,890
She'd move back, call Uncle Dastoor and say,

206
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:42,242
'Tell her I don't want to see her face, Dastoor Ahmed'!

207
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:49,965
'She better die... And if she can't, let her know that Kaneez Begum's dead for her'!

208
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:53,678
What are my options?

209
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,298
In that case...

210
00:32:58,178 --> 00:32:59,768
Seize her hand and say...

211
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:01,619
'I'm gonna die for real, Nano'!

212
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,310
As if she'd give two hoots.

213
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:10,439
No. She won't let you die. Focus on finding out about the one you want to live for.

214
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,190
Impossible!

215
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,034
What do you mean? Just call him!

216
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,570
I'd call that loafer?

217
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:22,800
Aye, fair enough... I'm sure youse twos will be oh-so-shy now...

218
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,230
You said God-knows-what about him, and now you're saying you want to marry him?

219
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,750
By the Lord, I never said that!

220
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,951
Well, maybe you didn't, but we heard it!

221
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:37,312
I just asked him to stay here.

222
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,192
Does it look good? Leaving the country over a trifle?

223
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:45,201
That's what everyone's furious about. You think the engagement was a trifle.

224
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:51,911
Call him, pinhead! Ask him how well he can cheat death!

225
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,832
It's all your fault!

226
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:59,673
I nearly put the ring on!

227
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:05,141
If you put the ring on, I wouldn't have let you take it off.

228
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:10,301
And that's the only good thing about the scene last night - you not wearing the ring.

229
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:16,632
I'm sure you broke many hearts. But if you'd taken it off after wearing it, it might've killed someone.

230
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,498
I've been thinking all night...

231
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,771
What would've they gone through?

232
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,348
The one I stopped...

233
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,099
And the one I let go of?

234
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,498
Just see him once.

235
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:37,114
I'm sure you'd be a bit ashamed, but try not to look like it.

236
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:43,529
Many would've comforted him, but he won't find peace until he's met you.

237
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,539
And... Don't be afraid even if someone pointed a gun at your head.

238
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't give in to anyone's tears.

239
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:55,512
You don't have or ask for mercy in love.

240
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:59,812
And don't come to the table for breakfast while Mum's around.

241
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:00,710
Why?

242
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,958
Because there's knives, forks, and china plates.

243
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,258
Hey...

244
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,619
When do I see him?

245
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:17,149
Who?

246
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,018
Gulrez.

247
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,808
Try to see him today.

248
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,080
What do I tell him?

249
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,703
Do I have to tell you? You're one weird girl.

250
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:35,645
Just say... 'If that's what was destined for us'...

251
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,725
Destined?

252
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:40,186
I'm sure he's heard the old

253
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:42,816
'Matches are made in Heaven'.

254
00:35:42,956 --> 00:35:44,844
Ah, lovely excuse...

255
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:48,626
There's no better excuse than destiny when you're helpless.

256
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:55,266
I just wish he understands...

257
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,458
May he not curse me.

258
00:35:58,548 --> 00:36:03,388
Then just go and beg, 'Please don't curse me, Gulrez'!

259
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:05,429
By the way...

260
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:11,831
You don't need to chant any incantations or say anything to curse.

261
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,652
If you see him tormented, crying, just think he's cursing.

262
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
