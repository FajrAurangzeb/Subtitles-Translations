1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, now, you illywhacker... Put it on her.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give him your hand already, my girl.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Waqar?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just gone.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Back where he'd come from.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His flight leaves at 2 a.m.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're leaving?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked if you're leaving.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got engaged?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop the car!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stop the car.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go anywhere, Waqar...

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my sake...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave me in here...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to tell you something...

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think... I want to tell you, Nano...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I want everyone else to know...

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When you get us engaged as kids... We're too young...

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Too young to know what it means...

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What we eat, when we sleep - You decide everything.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We eat even when we're not hungry.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Doze off even when we're not sleepy...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We're so stupid we skive off school for fun...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We realise later that school's more important.

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We pray that our teachers get hurt,

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or the city rises up in an insurrection,

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without a care for the living or the dead... We just want the school to close down!

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But these wishes, these curses...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't really mean anything.

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We know what death is.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We know death

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As a moment of sorrow and mourning.

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But we don't know what it means to die...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Our life's without any logic.

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fighting for no reason, then making peace for no reason...

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've heard I was 10 when you got me engaged to Gulrez.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you told me...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I must've been delighted and agreed.

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did any of you ever think about the reason I was so happy?

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I might just be thinking that engagements and weddings are more excuses to skive off school! Who knows!

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you're all wondering why I had to accept it just to refuse on the day of the engagement.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In truth...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been fighting myself until the moment I put on the ring and refused...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wanted to sacrifice myself for your happiness.

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I lost as the clock struck 12.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My heart, which used to celebrate another day off 10 years ago,

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Started beating for someone.

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Neelam...

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it isn't Gulrez.

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So it's you...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's old man... You blighter!

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You charred three lives in the searing flames of your desires,

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only to die and escape everything! How convenient!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you think?

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your sins would die with you?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That the record of your sins would be buried with you?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Aurangzeb! No...

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your generations have to pay for it

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Until every score's been settled.

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
HEAR ME IF YOU CAN!

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't...

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't cower in your grave thinking that everyone will forget the seeds you've sown now that you're dust.

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sins are debts, Aurangzeb! DEBTS!

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sins are debts, Aurangzeb.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the debts of the father

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are to be laid upon the children.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
AURANGZEB!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed! Go and tell him if he's upstairs that Ammi Begum ain't going away so quickly!

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He better not set foot here until I'm dead!

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
GO!

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew in the morning what was going to happen tonight...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you know how?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I had to go somewhere in the afternoon.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My Foxy didn't start...

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was like, 'Jesus Christ, mate'...

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You're gonna kill me today'.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For many years now, that's how she told me to stop.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This is her signal.

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's how I know

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That it's not the day.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I knew by the afternoon.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I thought the day would change by midnight, when I'd get engaged...

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hoped, perhaps, that so would my fate...

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But Nano...

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's always in a hurry.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't even wait until midnight.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Comforting won't make this sorrow vanish into thin air.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It isn't a cure either that'd work like a spell on your pat.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you ask me, I'm honoured.

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just think of it this way...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's confident that I can take it.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go and comfort the one who's suffering in someone else's sorrow. He needs it more than me.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He didn't come here, Ammi Begum.

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How will he?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who could he look in the eye?

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please sit, Ammi Begum.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cool down and think over it.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a blimmin' fireball right now and you want me to cool down?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get it through to him! He better leave the country! Or the city at the very least!

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I better not see him while I'm alive!

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jeez...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Jeez'?

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're pushing yourself, Ammi Begum.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's here after ages.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember your prayers?

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All wasted as far as I care, Dastoor Ahmed.

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now, I pray that I hear the rotter's landed in London.

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I think... He would've landed by tomorrow.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he'd think about the family's honour... And your order.

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He isn't going, Dastoor Ahmed...

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's silence was enough to stop him.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And now the twit's called out to him.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember this place? From your Mum and Dad's last days?

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I almost miss the Saturday nights, the Sunday mornings! So lively...

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not to mention the cricket matches in the lawn. In the floodlights!

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum used to bowl too!

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your Mum and Dad stayed in this room when they were here.

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it's a bit dusty... It's only cleaned once a year.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the spiderwebs! But don't worry...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll have it cleaned.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's okay, Munshi Alam... But what next?

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado would be furious.

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's why I brought you here.

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've saved your life, so to speak.

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? She'd kill me if she saw me?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I wouldn't rule that out.

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't know how much she loves me.

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I did... Until yesterday evening.

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea now.

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the food... What about the food? I don't think anyone would deliver anything here.

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry while I'm here.

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just think about how long you're staying here.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean?

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's best for you that you leave.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leave?

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It ain't easy to take up arms against Ammi Begum.

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait in the lounge outside while I clean the room.

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mind if I ask something?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It wasn't right, was it?

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's been Gulrez's fiancée for years.

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We never thought she wouldn't marry him.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And we had absolutely no idea she'd refuse on the day of the engagement!

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sorry?

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're sorry about something?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't love Maheen?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you love Maheen?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why are you sorry, then?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait in the lawn.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You want to read my diary?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. Why would I? I thought it'd wake you up.

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Mum up?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Scared?

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm scared because she's worried.

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you talk to him?

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The one you asked to not go anywhere.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did he leave?

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think he'd leave for any English rose in the world?

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano would fill him with lead.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about you?

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't think she'd even consider me worth aiming a gun at...

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fall at her feet when you see her.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd move back, call Uncle Dastoor and say,

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Tell her I don't want to see her face, Dastoor Ahmed'!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'She better die... And if she can't, let her know that Kaneez Begum's dead for her'!

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are my options?

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In that case...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Seize her hand and say...

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'm gonna die for real, Nano'!

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if she'd give two hoots.

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No. She won't let you die. Focus on finding out about the one you want to live for.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Impossible!

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do you mean? Just call him!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd call that loafer?

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye, fair enough... I'm sure youse twos will be oh-so-shy now...

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You said God-knows-what about him, and now you're saying you want to marry him?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the Lord, I never said that!

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, maybe you didn't, but we heard it!

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just asked him to stay here.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Does it look good? Leaving the country over a trifle?

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what everyone's furious about. You think the engagement was a trifle.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Call him, pinhead! Ask him how well he can cheat death!

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all your fault!

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I nearly put the ring on!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you put the ring on, I wouldn't have let you take it off.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And that's the only good thing about the scene last night - you not wearing the ring.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you broke many hearts. But if you took it off after wearing it, it might've killed someone.

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been thinking all night...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What would've they gone through? The one I stopped... And the one I let go of?

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just see him once. I'm sure you'd be a bit ashamed, but try not to look like it.

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Many would've comforted him, but he won't find peace until he's met you.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And... Don't be afraid even if someone pointed a gun at your head.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't give in to anyone's tears.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't have or ask for mercy in love.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And don't come to the table for breakfast while Mum's around.

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Because there's knives, forks, and china plates.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When do I see him?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who?

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Try to see him today.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What do I tell him?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do I have to tell you? You're one weird girl.

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say... 'If that's what was destined for us'...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Destined?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure he's heard the old 'matches are made in Heaven'.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ah, lovely excuse...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no better excuse than destiny when you're helpless.

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wish he understands...

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May he not curse me.

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then just go and beg, 'Please don't curse me, Gulrez'!

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
By the way...

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to chant any incantations or say anything to curse.

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you see him tormented, crying, just think he's cursing.

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
