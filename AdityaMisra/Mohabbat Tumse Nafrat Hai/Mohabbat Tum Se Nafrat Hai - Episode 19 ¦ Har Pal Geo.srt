1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,049
He's gone, Maheen!

2
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,010
Mum insulted him so much he won't even be there at the wedding!

3
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,231
Whose wedding?

4
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,575
Yours. And mine!

5
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:20,152
Jesus, her barbs! She literally asked him to just say goodbye and leave!

6
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:23,621
She even asked the servant to take away his teacup!

7
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:24,601
She didn't.

8
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:25,950
I swear she did!

9
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,391
You've all just got one for theatrics!

10
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:33,686
You should be happy. Love without enemies is as bland as an arranged marriage!

11
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:37,056
That's what bothers me! No open enemies!

12
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:40,630
What d'you want? Everyone out guns blazing?

13
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,660
I want a storm that may almost kill us!

14
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,741
What?

15
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,831
Lock us up!

16
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:51,196
Don't let us meet - or see each other's face!

17
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,340
And when we get caught meeting in secret --

18
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,676
Yeahhh?

19
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,671
Imprison me in here!

20
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,083
Lock the doors!

21
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,013
And what about <i>him</i>?

22
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:06,185
He's a man. I'm sure he can take a proper beating.

23
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:10,858
You off your head?

24
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:14,479
Not any more than your average lover!

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,273
I mean, just imagine for a moment...

26
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,878
Uncle Dastoor...

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,250
Munshi Alam...

28
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,359
Waqar Ahmed...

29
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,820
And Gulrez...

30
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,741
All of 'em giving him a proper pasting!

31
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:29,270
And he...

32
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,490
Wounded, bleeding,

33
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,187
Chanting my name,

34
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,973
Banging his head outside our place!

35
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:36,628
Screaming -

36
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:38,869
'I'd die without my Maheen'!

37
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,169
'I'll kill myself'!

38
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,950
Blimey, Fajr... We'll be all over the news! Just imagine!

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,162
Where are you off to?

40
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:51,838
I'm late for Uni!

41
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,188
Is he there?

42
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:06,138
I heard

43
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:09,858
Him march in...

44
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,078
Climb the stairs,

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,248
And hole up in his room...

46
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,728
I

47
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:22,978
Even heard him slam the door.

48
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:25,639
What happened?

49
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,800
I've insulted him so much he won't forget for ages.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,980
Lovely.

51
00:03:32,354 --> 00:03:34,384
Please tell me

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,631
You didn't let them see each other.

53
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:41,010
What are you saying, Ammi Begum! He tried looking up, but I stopped him.

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,279
'Don't you dare look up there'!

55
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:47,509
Lovely. Well done.

56
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,530
And the girl?

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,541
What's up with her?

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,311
She's in her room.

59
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,252
Hurt by his wounds.

60
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,922
She didn't even go to University today!

61
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,710
Don't let her if she wanted to.

62
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,048
What?

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,538
Why?

64
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,321
Tell her she's not needed there.

65
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,542
Not cricket, Ammi Begum.

66
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:15,672
What about her studies?

67
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,539
So much has happened for that to matter...

68
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:21,710
I mean, who bothers study in love?

69
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:27,998
But if she went to University, they'll get a chance to see each other.

70
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,695
That's right...

71
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,888
But it's her last semester.

72
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:36,319
It's the last thing on her lovesick mind, Suraiyya... Never forget that.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,847
I pity him though...

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,828
He looked so frightened...

75
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,049
Blimey, Ammi Begum... I almost teared up!

76
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,725
Have some shame...

77
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:50,006
You're getting in the way of my word.

78
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:53,096
Everyone up there in the Heavens

79
00:04:53,096 --> 00:04:56,997
Would be cursing you at this moment!

80
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,780
If I got Gulrez Akhtar's fiancée

81
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,228
Married to Waqar Ahmed,

82
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:07,937
I'd earn their curses too!

83
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,117
So forget it

84
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:14,098
And save yourself from disgracing the departed.

85
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,913
Or, when it is my time,

86
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,785
No one would look at me the right way...

87
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,572
Hang up, now...

88
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,668
And face the wretched lovers with all your might!

89
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,391
Hi!

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,021
No 'Hi' or 'Hello's here.

91
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,071
Greet properly if you have to, young man.

92
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:23,893
Peace, Aunt.

93
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:26,848
Hmm.

94
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:32,848
Ammi Begum's forbidden me from wishing you peace.

95
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,318
How'd you like that?

96
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:51,558
Put him in his place!

97
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,978
Have some shame, Mehrunnisa...

98
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,809
'Put him in his place'...

99
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:58,241
Did you have to say

100
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,258
<i>I</i> forbade you?

101
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:02,040
Why couldn't you say,

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,908
'I don't want to talk to you'?

103
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,909
That'd put him in his place

104
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,190
And show me you're standing by me

105
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,530
And keeping my word.

106
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,798
Tell me, Mehrunnisa...

107
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,210
Don't you pity Gulrez?

108
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,940
I do, Ammi Begum.

109
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:33,028
A lot, in fact.

110
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:37,068
But it's all Maheen's fault!

111
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:41,469
It's not her fault.

112
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,038
This blighter

113
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,838
Knows every trick to charm hearts.

114
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:50,007
His time with his English roses

115
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,438
Has earned him

116
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,611
Quite the experience!

117
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,842
Ahh...

118
00:07:56,921 --> 00:08:00,731
No one loves the 'experienced', Ammi Begum!

119
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,500
One look at them and you know

120
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,799
They're 'experienced'!

121
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,882
They both look like complete newbies to me!

122
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,182
They're scared...

123
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,948
Yet so unafraid...

124
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,518
Hello?

125
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:42,968
What is it?

126
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,398
I've been going through your letters.

127
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,219
What is it now?

128
00:08:47,287 --> 00:08:49,068
You don't get it...

129
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:53,018
I read these over and over again...

130
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:55,270
I love them so much.

131
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,952
You've read them so many times.

132
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,481
You didn't write anything in this one...

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,960
Just... Her name...

134
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,565
Nothing more, nothing less...

135
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,981
And at the bottom...

136
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,041
'Yours, Gulrez'?

137
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,520
D'you know

138
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,841
When I wrote that one?

139
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,281
When?

140
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,011
The day she said,

141
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,841
'Looking at you, it seems'

142
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,891
'You want to say something'...

143
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,018
Why didn't you tell her?

144
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,629
That's when I found out

145
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,068
I can't say anything to her.

146
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,368
You're mad.

147
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:47,949
Am I?

148
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,819
What d'you think I should've said?

149
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,520
'I love you'!

150
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,008
Of course!

151
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,678
What's funny here?

152
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,548
The helplessness of love...

153
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,378
I swear, Neelam...

154
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:13,299
Imagine the helplessness of the love

155
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:16,580
That needs you to say in so many words...

156
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,558
'I love you'...

157
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,490
Anyway...

158
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,830
Here's an idea...

159
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:34,480
Hmm?

160
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,881
Keep that letter...

161
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:40,920
And burn the rest.

162
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,471
Why?

163
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,872
I feel like it's the only one that matters...

164
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,583
The rest are just... Useless...

165
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,878
Anyway, get back to work...

166
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,148
Tell me...

167
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,024
Yeah?

168
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,878
Why'd you call me?

169
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:07,918
Just --

170
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,528
Thought I'd have a chat...

171
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,468
Check on you and see if you're working hard!

172
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:13,985
I swear

173
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,628
I'm working very hard.

174
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,638
Don't worry.

175
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,178
I love you.

176
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,559
I love you too.

177
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,998
Why don't you marry Gulrez?

178
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,640
I don't like him.

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,750
But he's good.

180
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,879
Perhaps better than him.

181
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,850
Give me his number.

182
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,658
Hey!

183
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,338
Like, for real?

184
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,398
Just give me his number.

185
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:21,908
I'll talk to him right away.

186
00:12:21,998 --> 00:12:23,357
What'd you say?

187
00:12:23,357 --> 00:12:24,729
What else?

188
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,869
Show some sympathy...

189
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,660
And tell him not to grieve.

190
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,630
Show him he can fix his broken heart with another girl.

191
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,272
I'm at your service if you don't mind!

192
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,021
Whoa, you're shameless!

193
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,062
Not more than you!

194
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,923
You're passing me the lover you rejected?

195
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:49,972
Gee, Jiya...

196
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,172
I'm so worried...

197
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,411
I fear he may curse me!

198
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,191
I would too!

199
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,411
Hey!

200
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:00,132
Why would you?

201
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:05,313
For a while, I actually thought Waqar could be mine once you're married off to Gulrez.

202
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:10,443
But you robbed me of the glory [Waqar] of the moment in a flash!

203
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:13,864
I swear I've got no idea

204
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:15,728
How it happened

205
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:16,867
Or why...

206
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,585
No idea at all...

207
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,976
But love's a virus

208
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,037
That strikes the healthiest of girls!

209
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:26,037
Started seeing him yet?

210
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:28,097
I doubt I ever will.

211
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:32,348
I mean, just look at Mum's fury! She looks like she'd rip me apart!

212
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,971
And Nano! God forgive her!

213
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:37,280
She's boycotting us both!

214
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,598
She said, 'No one's talking to them'!

215
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:47,841
And, 'Don't even greet them back'!

216
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,153
Oh, really?

217
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,620
I'm sure you've called each other.

218
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,855
I swear we haven't.

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,999
I don't dare.

220
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,568
Why?

221
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,358
Honestly?

222
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,726
Hmm?

223
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:04,229
I'm a bit shy...

224
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,519
Hey!

225
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,399
What happened?

226
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,644
Just a minute...

227
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,838
There!

228
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:21,408
Mum just locked me in!

229
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,129
You know, it's so romantic!

230
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:26,778
I love it!

231
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,849
Mehrunnisa!

232
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,482
Suraiyya's locked her in!

233
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,999
What d'you mean?

234
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:09,609
Locked her in her room!

235
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,278
Ahh...

236
00:15:13,158 --> 00:15:16,248
Sent her to Coventry!

237
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,848
What'd she do there?

238
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,047
Oh, can it...

239
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:25,717
You know, as they say in English...

240
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,471
A boycott...

241
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm talking about that!

242
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,378
She will stay in that room,

243
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:42,629
Locked until she accept's Gulrez's proposal.

244
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,559
She ain't gettin' out!

245
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,898
Don't believe me?

246
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,298
I do, Ammi Begum...

247
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:00,668
But I pity you a bit too...

248
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:05,457
Wonder which lad out there's got the nerve to pity me.

249
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,825
They call me Kaneez Begum.

250
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:13,220
And they call her Maheen Aurangzeb.

251
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:19,516
She'd make mincemeat of you and Suraiyya and cut you down to size!

252
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,318
Oh, I'm looking forward to the battle, Mehrunnisa...

253
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,868
I'm looking forward to the day they see just how ruthless Kaneez Begum can be.

254
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:34,898
Fair enough... Let's see...

255
00:16:34,898 --> 00:16:37,148
Please, do...

256
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:40,833
And tell everyone about it after I'm gone...

257
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,429
That Kaneez Begum

258
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:46,910
Could behead for her family's honour,

259
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,411
But never compromise.

260
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,728
Hmm...

261
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,081
What'd you do

262
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,940
If...

263
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,019
She didn't have dinner?

264
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,239
Okay...

265
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:09,138
I know your cold heart's too numb to feel that...

266
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,788
But what if

267
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:15,529
She took a handful of sleeping pills?

268
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,719
They say

269
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,798
They work best

270
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,799
Without food.

271
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,908
I'm sure she can take four...

272
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,178
But

273
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm not so sure about the fifth...

274
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,659
What if she accidentally

275
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,328
Took six...?

276
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,028
I'm sorry, Ammi Begum...

277
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,841
What d'you mean, 'I'm sorry'?

278
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,099
Curse my tongue.

279
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,580
Just --

280
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,018
Ask Suraiyya

281
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,597
To have a doctor at the ready.

282
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,732
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about...

283
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,727
She's a smart and educated girl.

284
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,630
Surely, she'd never even <i>think</i> about taking six...

285
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,958
Good Lord...

286
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,578
Ahh...

287
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,949
First... Promise me

288
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,529
What you see and hear here

289
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,088
Stays in here. Between us.

290
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,129
I promise...

291
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,958
These are the letters

292
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:34,020
He's been writing to Maheen for the last ten years

293
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,598
But never sent to her.

294
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,513
Could you

295
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,151
Go through them... Just once?

296
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,808
Honestly?

297
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,658
I never wanted to fall for her.

298
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,459
I'm sure she never wanted to fall for me either.

299
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,807
So I don't need these letters...

300
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:28,517
One look at you tells me just how much he loves Maheen.

301
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,737
I swear, I'm not in the way of his love.

302
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:36,658
His love's the only one standing in his way.

303
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,338
Could you --

304
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,528
Think about it...

305
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:45,219
And tell me - If I forgot everything and went to London,

306
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,839
Do you think she'd accept Gulrez's proposal?

307
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,518
Why'd you ever come back?

308
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:02,469
She stopped me.

309
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,620
I couldn't go on.

310
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,598
Just refuse.

311
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,968
Just say --

312
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,729
'I don't love you'... Or even...

313
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,768
'I hate you'!

314
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,953
I can say I don't love her...

315
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,788
But not...

316
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,521
That I hate her...

317
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,959
Wait.

318
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,778
Don't leave just yet...

319
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:56,578
Sit...

320
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,508
I'm very cruel, ain't I?

321
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,479
Not one bit.

322
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,799
A sister's love, like a mother's, is 100% selfish.

323
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,681
Know what, Neelam...

324
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,038
I'm ashamed of myself...

325
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,448
I think...

326
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,508
If I married Maheen before Gulrez's eyes...

327
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,739
How could I look him in the eye as I take her with me?

328
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,238
Your pained groan would curse me.

329
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,928
You're my sister too...

330
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,768
Who'd want his sister's curse?

331
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:00,877
Look... I've never seen her -- Never talked about anything...

332
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:03,598
So tell me...

333
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:06,817
Think carefully...

334
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,479
When I see her...

335
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,991
What d'you want me to say?

336
00:24:13,111 --> 00:24:15,432
I mean, I need a punchline

337
00:24:15,432 --> 00:24:17,552
That I say

338
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,233
And she leaves, spitting in my face!

339
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,960
What are you doing? Easy there...

340
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,999
For my sake...

341
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,660
You're disgracing me in my own eyes.

342
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,560
I guess I'll have to come up with something myself.

343
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,265
May the Lord help me say something so bitter

344
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,059
She'd kick me out of the country the moment she heard it.

345
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,419
You have my word...

346
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,838
I may not be like Gulrez...

347
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,641
But I'm your brother...

348
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,178
No...

349
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:16,958
For my sake... Not another tear...

350
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,018
Just --

351
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,479
Give me two days... I'll show you what I can do.

352
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:25,524
What are you gonna do?

353
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,958
I'm gonna tell her

354
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,048
I hate her.

355
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,605
I swear.

356
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,928
But promise me...

357
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,287
Come what may,

358
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,478
You won't tell Gulrez anything.

359
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,769
C'mon. I want your word!

360
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,718
Now you're suckin' diesel.

361
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,068
If I don't see you before leaving for London...

362
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:17,208
Just know the job's done.

363
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,908
Bye.

364
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,289
C'mon, mun, say goodbye!

365
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,988
Keep it there

366
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,421
And leave.

367
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,539
Not so fast.

368
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Take it back.

369
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,129
What?

370
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:26,489
I ain't eatin' anything.

371
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,949
Then remember,

372
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,289
You won't get food when you want.

373
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,559
I'm callin' the shots here.

374
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,708
Keep on with your cruelty. Don't tell me how to react.

375
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,888
Fair enough.

376
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:42,042
You won't get anything until 9 p.m.

377
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,151
Guess what, I ain't havin' anything at 9 either.

378
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:46,462
You intend to starve yourself in here?

379
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:48,991
Ain't your problem.

380
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,152
Listen here, girl...

381
00:27:52,152 --> 00:27:56,262
If you think this is gonna make me have mercy,

382
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:58,243
You're very wrong!

383
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,268
No mercy!

384
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:02,279
That's what I want!

385
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,079
You locked me in.

386
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,391
I choose to starve myself.

387
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,498
You should be happy.

388
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:11,738
I'm helping you be doubly cruel.

389
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:14,938
Keep at it and you'll die in here!

390
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:16,559
Wow...

391
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,858
How romantic!

392
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,502
Romantic!?

393
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:22,183
Stay tuned...

394
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:24,708
It'll be a sight to behold when my pall is lifted...

395
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,525
It'll be all over the telly!

396
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:32,400
I can almost see your and Nano's picture on either side of ours...

397
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,939
I swear,

398
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:37,010
They're gonna blow you all to bits!

399
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,789
A poor girl

400
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:40,509
And her poor lover...

401
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:42,479
Thanks to these two...

402
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:45,030
Who conspired to kill 'em!

403
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,601
To the dickens with them!

404
00:28:48,196 --> 00:28:51,693
And what are you waiting for? Take it away!

405
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,117
Out!

406
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,448
Don't let the door hit you...

407
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:06,018
Don't worry.

408
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:09,079
Don't forget the lock the door behind you.

409
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:05,298
Who's this for?

410
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,578
Maheen...

411
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:09,308
She refused.

412
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,039
Peace, Mum.

413
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,289
To you too.

414
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,651
Is Maheen okay?

415
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,531
Perfectly.

416
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,830
Why'd you send the food to her room? Can't she come down here?

417
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,469
She can't.

418
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:23,579
Shut up.

419
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:24,909
Why not?

420
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,620
N -- No way I'm stayin' quiet...

421
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:30,560
S -- She's locked her in her room!

422
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,431
And hid the key in her scarf.

423
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,142
What?

424
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:38,200
She sent some food for her, but Mademoiselle refused to have anything.

425
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,469
Go.

426
00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:41,269
And take that away!

427
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,049
No one else is gonna answer the phone.

428
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,808
Hello?

429
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,721
I hope she's had lunch.

430
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,319
No.

431
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,261
Don't be so cruel... Give her something.

432
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:15,761
But how?

433
00:31:15,761 --> 00:31:17,181
She refused it!

434
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:18,950
Don't worry...

435
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,638
Hunger will make her have second thoughts...

436
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:25,551
She won't.

437
00:31:25,628 --> 00:31:27,608
She scolded Qutb

438
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:30,078
And asked him not to bring her dinner.

439
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,488
I hope you heard that.

440
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,482
Of course...

441
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:39,688
Surely...

442
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,099
She's got no sleeping pills around?

443
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:44,430
Aye.

444
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,431
She's always got them.

445
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,418
What are you saying?

446
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:51,458
Only the truth.

447
00:31:51,689 --> 00:31:54,509
Why'd you ask about sleeping pills?

448
00:31:54,509 --> 00:31:56,889
I'm off my head...

449
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:59,190
They say

450
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,428
They work best without food... They don't need a moment...

451
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,933
So they do...

452
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,758
You twit...

453
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,648
Hang up right now

454
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:12,035
And keep her away from them!

455
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:13,505
Heavens...

456
00:32:13,835 --> 00:32:15,176
And...

457
00:32:15,236 --> 00:32:16,195
Yeah?

458
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:19,636
Unlock the door. Let her go where she wants.

459
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:21,196
We give up?

460
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:23,847
We ease her.

461
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:25,880
But never

462
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,320
Give up like that.

463
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,568
Stay tuned...

464
00:32:29,568 --> 00:32:34,072
I'm comin' up with something so baffling, so powerful...

465
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:38,409
It'll scare away all this fear of sleeping pills...

466
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,068
Enough for now...

467
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:43,768
Don't tarry about!

468
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:47,264
How long d'you think she'd need to take a few?

469
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:48,565
Okay...

470
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,004
So, what d'you think?

471
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,058
Don't you think

472
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:22,467
It's all so... Theatrical?

473
00:33:22,608 --> 00:33:23,997
What?

474
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:26,658
You know... How...

475
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:31,310
You're about to kill your selfless love for Gulrez?

476
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:34,830
And leave for the other end of the world?

477
00:33:34,863 --> 00:33:37,470
The only thing that's left

478
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:41,451
Is you taking the blame for her.

479
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,760
Don't even think about it. She knows her films.

480
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,144
Shut up, Jiya...

481
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,298
Although...

482
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,761
It ain't all <i>that</i> theatrical...

483
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,408
What?

484
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,610
You know she'd actually be green with envy at the sound of your name? A while back.

485
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,818
So?

486
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:04,229
So...

487
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,598
How 'bout we make her greener?

488
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,498
How?

489
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,678
Blimey, Sherlock...

490
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:16,477
If she saw me flirting with you, don't you think she'd kick me out herself?

491
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,708
Why'd <i>you</i> flirt with <i>me</i>?

492
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:25,420
With anyone else,

493
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,360
She'd know I'm faking it.

494
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:28,830
Oh...

495
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,918
So you're gonna slander me to convince her?

496
00:34:35,008 --> 00:34:36,149
Guess what,

497
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:41,072
All the writers try their best to show that the hero's innocent.

498
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:44,306
'Poor lad'... 'Sacrificing his love'...

499
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,230
They don't know

500
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,048
It's the girl he fakes it with

501
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:51,892
Who's sacrificing something for real.

502
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,958
No, sweetheart.

503
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,907
I won't be her.

504
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,898
I'm sorry, Jiya... I didn't mean it.

505
00:35:00,118 --> 00:35:02,678
I just wanted you to help me out.

506
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:05,217
Okay...

507
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,807
I'll try something...

508
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:10,948
So...

509
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:14,138
You just want to be out of her life somehow, yes?

510
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,518
Aye.

511
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,818
Simple. How 'bout you marry me?

512
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:29,427
How 'bout going the whole nine yards

513
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:32,739
And leaving me with your sacrificed hide?

514
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,127
It's all I'll be content with...

515
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,879
So...

516
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:59,641
You just want to be out of her life somehow, yes?

517
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,158
Simple. How 'bout you marry me?

518
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,548
Don't go anywhere, Waqar... For my sake...

519
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:07,063
Just refuse.

520
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:08,519
Just say --

521
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:11,049
'I don't love you'... Or...

522
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,440
Even...

523
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,399
'I hate you'!

524
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,008
Maheen?

525
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,148
Maheen!

526
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,990
Maheen!

527
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
