1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's gone, Maheen!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum insulted him so much he won't even be there at the wedding!

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whose wedding?

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yours. And mine!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
God, her barbs! She literally asked him to just say goodbye and leave!

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She even asked the servant to take away his teacup!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear she did!

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've all just got one for theatrics!

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be happy. Love without enemies is as bland as an arranged marriage!

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what bothers me! No open enemies!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you want? Everyone out guns blazing?

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want a storm that may almost kill us!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lock us up!

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let us meet - or see each other's face!

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And when we get caught meeting in secret --
-Yeahhh?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imprison me in here! Lock the doors!

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what about him?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's a man. I'm sure he can take a proper beating.

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You off your head?

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not any more than your average lover!

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just imagine for a moment...

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Uncle Dastoor...

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Munshi Alam...

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed...

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Gulrez...

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All of 'em giving him a proper pasting!

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And he...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wounded, bleeding,

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Chanting my name,

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Banging his head outside our place!

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Screaming -

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I'd die without my Maheen! I'll kill myself'!

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Fajr... We'll be all over the news! Just imagine!

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where are you off to?

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm late for Uni!

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is he there?

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I heard

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Him march in...

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Climb the stairs,

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And hole up in his room...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even heard him slam the door.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've insulted him so much he won't forget for ages.

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely.

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please tell me

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't let them see each other.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying, Ammi Begum! He tried looking up, but I stopped him.

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Don't you dare look up there'!

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Lovely. Well done.

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the girl?

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up with her?

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's in her room.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hurt by his wounds.

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't even go to University today!

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let her if she wanted to.

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her she's not needed there.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not cricket, Ammi Begum.

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about her studies?

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much has happened for that to matter...

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, who bothers study in love?

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But if she went to University, they'll get a chance to see each other.

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's right...

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's her last semester.

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the last thing on her lovesick mind, Suraiyya... Never forget that.

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I pity him though...

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He looked so frightened...

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Ammi Begum... I almost teared up!

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame...

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're getting in the way of my word.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Everyone up there in the Heavens

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would be cursing you at this moment!

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I got Gulrez Akhtar's fiancée

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Married to Waqar Ahmed,

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd earn their curses too!

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So forget it

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And save yourself from disgracing the departed.

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or, when it is my time,

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one would look at me the right way...

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hang up, now...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And face the wretched lovers with all your might!

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No 'Hi' or 'Hello's here.

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Greet properly if you have to, young man.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Aunt.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ammi Begum's forbidden me from wishing you peace.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you like that?

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Put him in his place!

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Have some shame, Mehrunnisa...

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Put him in his place'...

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you have to say

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>I forbade you?</i>

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why couldn't you say,

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I don't want to talk to you'?

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That'd put him in his place

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And show me you're standing by me

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And keeping my word.

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me, Mehrunnisa...

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you pity Gulrez?

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do, Ammi Begum.

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A lot, in fact.

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it's all Maheen's fault!

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's not her fault.

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This blighter

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Knows every trick to charm hearts.

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His time with his English roses

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has earned him

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Quite the experience!

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one loves the 'experienced', Ammi Begum!

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One look at them and you know

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're 'experienced'!

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They both look like complete newbies to me!

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're scared...

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yet so unafraid...

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it?

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've been going through your letters.

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What is it now?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't get it...

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I read these over and over again...

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love them so much.

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You've read them so many times.

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't write anything in this one...

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just... Her name...

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nothing more, nothing less...

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And at the bottom... 'Yours, Gulrez'?

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
D'you know

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I wrote that one?

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When?

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The day she said,

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Looking at you, it seems'

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'You want to say something'...

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you tell her?

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's when I found out

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't say anything to her.

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're mad.

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Am I?

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you think I should've said?

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I love you'!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course!

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's funny here?

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The helplessness of love...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, Neelam...

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Imagine the helplessness of the love

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That needs you to say in so many words...

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I love you'...

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway...

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Here's an idea...

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep that letter...

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And burn the rest.

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I feel like it's the only one that matters...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The rest are just... Useless...

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Anyway, get back to work...

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell me...

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you call me?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thought I'd have a chat...

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Check on you and see if you're working hard!

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm working very hard.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you.

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you too.

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why don't you marry Gulrez?

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't like him.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he's good.

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perhaps better than him.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me his number.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like, for real?

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just give me his number.

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll talk to him right away.

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you say?

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What else?

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show some sympathy...

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell him not to grieve.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show him he can fix his broken heart with another girl.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm at your service if you don't mind!

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoa, you're shameless!

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not more than you!

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're passing me the lover you rejected?

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gee, Jiya...

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm so worried...

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I fear he may curse me!

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I would too!

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why would you?

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For a while, I actually thought Waqar could be mine once you're married off to Gulrez.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you robbed me of the glory [Waqar] of the moment in a flash!

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear I've got no idea

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How it happened

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or why...

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No idea at all...

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But love's a virus

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That strikes the healthiest of girls!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Started seeing him yet?

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I doubt I ever will.

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, just look at Mum's fury! She looks like she'd rip me apart!

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Nano! God forgive her!

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's boycotting us both!

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She said, 'No one's talking to them'!

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, 'Don't even greet them back'!

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, really?

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure you've called each other.

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear we haven't.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't dare.

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why?

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm?

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm a bit shy...

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey!

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened?

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute...

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There!

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mum just locked me in!

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, it's so romantic!

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I love it!

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa!

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Suraiyya's locked her in!

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean?

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Locked her in her room!

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sent her to Coventry!

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd she do there?

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, can it...

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know, as they say in English...

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A boycott...

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about that!

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She will stay in that room,

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Locked until she accept's Gulrez's proposal.

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She ain't gettin' out!

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't believe me?

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do, Ammi Begum...

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I pity you a bit too...

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wonder which lad out there's got the nerve to pity me.

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They call me Kaneez Begum.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And they call her Maheen Aurangzeb.

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd make mincemeat of you and Suraiyya and cut you down to size!

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, I'm looking forward to the battle, Mehrunnisa...

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm looking forward to the day they see just how ruthless Kaneez Begum can be.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough... Let's see...

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, do...

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell everyone about it after I'm gone...

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That Kaneez Begum

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could behead for her family's honour,

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never compromise.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hmm...

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What'd you do

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If...

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She didn't have dinner?

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I know your cold heart's too numb to feel that...

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But what if

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She took a handful of sleeping pills?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They work best

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Without food.

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she can take four...

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm not so sure about the fifth...

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What if she accidentally

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Took six...?

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Ammi Begum...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you mean, 'I'm sorry'?

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Curse my tongue.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ask Suraiyya

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To have a doctor at the ready.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about...

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's a smart and educated girl.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely, she'd never even think about taking six...

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahh...

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
First... Promise me

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you see and hear here

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stays in here. Between us.

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise...

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
These are the letters

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been writing to Maheen for the last ten years

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never sent to her.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go through them... Just once?

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Honestly?

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I never wanted to fall for her.

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sure she never wanted to fall for me either.

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So I don't need these letters...

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One look at you tells me just how much he loves Maheen.

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear, I'm not in the way of his love.

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
His love's the only one standing in his way.

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Could you --

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think about it...

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell me - If I forgot everything and went to London,

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Do you think she'd accept Gulrez's proposal?

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you ever come back?

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She stopped me.

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I couldn't go on.

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just refuse.

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say --

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I don't love you'... Or even...

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I hate you'!

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can say I don't love her...

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But not...

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I hate her...

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait.

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't leave just yet...

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sit...

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm very cruel, ain't I?

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not one bit.

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A sister's love, like a mother's, is 100% selfish.

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Know what, Neelam...

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm ashamed of myself...

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think...

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I married Maheen before Gulrez's eyes...

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How could I look him in the eye as I take her with me?

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your pained groan would curse me.

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're my sister too...

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd want his sister's curse?

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look... I've never seen her -- Never talked about anything...

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So tell me...

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Think carefully...

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When I see her...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What d'you want me to say?

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, I need a punchline

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I say

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she leaves, spitting in my face!

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you doing? Easy there...

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my sake...

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're disgracing me in my own eyes.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I guess I'll have to come up with something myself.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
May the Lord help me say something so bitter

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd kick me out of the country the moment she heard it.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You have my word...

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I may not be like Gulrez...

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm your brother...

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No...

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For my sake... Not another tear...

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just --

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me two days... I'll show you what I can do.

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you gonna do?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell her

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hate her.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But promise me...

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come what may,

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't tell Gulrez anything.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon. I want your word!

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Now you're suckin' diesel.

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I don't see you before leaving for London...

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just know the job's done.

359
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.

360
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
C'mon, mun, say goodbye!

361
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep it there

362
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leave.

363
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not so fast.

364
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it back.

365
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

366
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I ain't eatin' anything.

367
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then remember,

368
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get food when you want.

369
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm callin' the shots here.

370
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep on with your cruelty. Don't tell me how to react.

371
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fair enough.

372
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You won't get anything until 9 p.m.

373
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what, I ain't havin' anything at 9 either.

374
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You intend to starve yourself in here?

375
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ain't your problem.

376
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Listen here, girl...

377
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you think this is gonna make me have mercy,

378
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're very wrong!

379
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No mercy!

380
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's what I want!

381
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You locked me in.

382
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I choose to starve myself.

383
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be happy.

384
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm helping you be doubly cruel.

385
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Keep at it and you'll die in here!

386
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wow...

387
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How romantic!

388
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Romantic!?

389
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned...

390
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be a sight to behold when my pall is lifted...

391
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll be all over the telly!

392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can almost see your and Nano's picture on either side of ours...

393
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear,

394
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They're gonna blow you all to bits!

395
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
A poor girl

396
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And her poor lover...

397
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks to these two...

398
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who conspired to kill 'em!

399
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To the dickens with them!

400
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And what are you waiting for? Take it away!

401
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out!

402
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't let the door hit you...

403
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

404
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't forget the lock the door behind you.

405
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's this for?

406
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen...

407
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She refused.

408
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Peace, Mum.

409
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To you too.

410
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is Maheen okay?

411
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Perfectly.

412
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you send the food to her room? Can't she come down here?

413
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She can't.

414
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up.

415
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why not?

416
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
N -- No way I'm stayin' quiet...

417
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
S -- She's locked her in her room!

418
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And hid the key in her scarf.

419
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

420
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She sent some food for her, but Maheen refused to have anything.

421
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Go.

422
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And take that away!

423
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No one else is gonna answer the phone.

424
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

425
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope she's had lunch.

426
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

427
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't be so cruel... Give her something.

428
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But how?

429
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She refused it!

430
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry...

431
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hunger will make her have second thoughts...

432
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't.

433
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She scolded Qutb

434
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And asked him not to bring her dinner.

435
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you heard that.

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of course...

437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Surely...

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's got no sleeping pills around?

439
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

440
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's always got them.

441
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you saying?

442
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only the truth.

443
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd you ask about sleeping pills?

444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm off my head...

445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They say

446
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They work best without food... They don't need a moment...

447
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So they do...

448
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You twit...

449
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hang up right now

450
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And keep her away from them!

451
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Heavens...

452
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And...

453
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah?

454
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Unlock the door. Let her go where she wants.

455
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We give up?

456
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We ease her.

457
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But never

458
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give up like that.

459
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Stay tuned...

460
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm comin' up with something so baffling, so powerful...

461
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'll scare away all this fear of sleeping pills...

462
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enough for now...

463
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't tarry about!

464
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How long d'you think she'd need to take a few?

465
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

466
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, what d'you think?

467
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you think

468
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all so... Theatrical?

469
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

470
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know... How...

471
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're about to kill your selfless love for Gulrez?

472
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leave for the other end of the world?

473
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The only thing that's left

474
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is you taking the blame for her.

475
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't even think about it. She knows her films.

476
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Shut up, Jiya...

477
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Although...

478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It ain't all that theatrical...</i>

479
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

480
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You know she'd actually be green with envy at the sound of your name? A while back.

481
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So?

482
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

483
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout we make her greener?

484
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How?

485
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, Sherlock...

486
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she saw me flirting with you, don't you think she'd kick me out herself?

487
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Why'd you flirt with me?</i>

488
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With anyone else,

489
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd know I'm faking it.

490
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh...

491
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So you're gonna slander me to convince her?

492
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Guess what,

493
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All the writers try their best to show that the hero's innocent.

494
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Poor lad'... 'Sacrificing his love'...

495
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They don't know

496
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's the girl he fakes it with

497
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's sacrificing something for real.

498
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, sweetheart.

499
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't be her.

500
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm sorry, Jiya... I didn't mean it.

501
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just wanted you to help me out.

502
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay...

503
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll try something...

504
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

505
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just want to be out of her life somehow, yes?

506
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Aye.

507
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Simple. How 'bout you marry me?

508
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How 'bout going the whole nine yards

509
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And leaving me with your sacrificed hide?

510
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all I'll be content with...

511
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So...

512
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You just want to be out of her life somehow, yes?

513
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Simple. How 'bout you marry me?

514
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't go anywhere, Waqar... For my sake...

515
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just refuse.

516
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say --

517
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I don't love you'... Or...

518
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Even...

519
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'I hate you'!

520
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen?

521
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

522
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen!

523
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
