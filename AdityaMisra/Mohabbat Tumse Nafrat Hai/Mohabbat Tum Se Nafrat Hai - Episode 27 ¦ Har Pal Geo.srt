1
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,303
Wait, Neelam.

2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,689
I've got something I'd want you to listen to.

3
00:01:07,395 --> 00:01:10,860
Today, all of you will have to listen.

4
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,159
Remember when you'd told me

5
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,470
That I'm your brother

6
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,347
Just like Gulrez was your brother?

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,749
Please, Neelam...

8
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,366
Just listen to me for once.

9
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,844
Come, Wali...

10
00:02:19,246 --> 00:02:21,624
You should be here, too.

11
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,470
I'd grown quite close to Maheen...

12
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,626
But as soon as I found out

13
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,551
That he was <i>her</i> father...

14
00:03:01,551 --> 00:03:03,918
The man

15
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:06,925
Who'd destroyed

16
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,985
My family...

17
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:14,141
I decided to get even with him...

18
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:16,568
Sometimes,

19
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:19,169
I'd pity her...

20
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,320
But then,

21
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,906
I'd listen to Mum's recorded cassettes

22
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,761
And

23
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,159
All my love for Maheen

24
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:40,018
Would change into bitter hatred.

25
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:45,390
I'd long thought

26
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,373
Of killing Maheen with the same weapon

27
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:53,960
That

28
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,399
Had been used to kill Mum...

29
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,223
Her handwriting...

30
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,227
The diary...

31
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,310
Maheen's diary...

32
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:47,508
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

33
00:04:47,508 --> 00:05:00,180
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

34
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,379
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>
All day, all night...

35
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,154
All day, all night...

36
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:05,199
She'd be lost in that diary of hers...

37
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,960
At last, I found the man for the job...

38
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:14,484
That bloke

39
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:17,647
Was quite the expert...

40
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,150
He just

41
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,749
Needed one look at someone's handwriting

42
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:28,578
To create an exact copy...

43
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,544
And then...

44
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,907
I --

45
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:45,310
I looked for another diary.

46
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,682
Had him write the content I wanted...

47
00:05:55,682 --> 00:06:00,389
'Maheen's diary' lying on the table...

48
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,921
Getting her

49
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,121
And her family

50
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,607
Out of their house...

51
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:25,578
And then provoking

52
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:29,156
Someone like you

53
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:34,700
So much that you couldn't resist reading the diary...

54
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,157
But my hard work...

55
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:56,505
My hard work...

56
00:06:56,505 --> 00:07:00,510
Opened the door to every success...

57
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,960
But <i>you</i> were the best of them all.

58
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,111
You took the diary along, too!

59
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,007
I regret

60
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:16,190
That I've ruined Maheen,

61
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,550
But I'm glad that I've avenged Mum.

62
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:26,830
I loved Maheen so much,

63
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:34,020
And I'd battled myself to get to despise that love,

64
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,350
But when I'd won, I felt so much pity for Maheen

65
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,034
That I thought I'd call her,

66
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:51,840
And tell her that when we, enmeshed in unexpected trials, ask what our fault had been,

67
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,300
It helps to know

68
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,728
That besides the property,

69
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:04,692
One inherits the debt of the sins of one's father,

70
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,312
And, regrettably,

71
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:12,312
It is the upright children who have to pay it back.

72
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,457
You can come out now, Dad.

73
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,724
Your debts have been settled.

74
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,226
I've paid it back with the blood of my yearnings.

75
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:39,941
I...

76
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,218
Your daughter...

77
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,779
Maheen Aurangzeb?

78
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,872
You don't need to worry about anything.

79
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,651
Enjoy yourself.

80
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,130
Feel free to keep sinning.

81
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:07,251
When it's time to expiate,

82
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:10,918
The kids will take care of it, of course.

83
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:14,819
Otherwise, what good would your kids be?

84
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,751
Just a minute, Neelam...

85
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,572
Allow me.

86
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,152
I want to take Maheen along.

87
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,803
Where?

88
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,639
To Dado's.

89
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:13,449
I won't get forgiven without her testimony.

90
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,157
I promise I'll leave her here once I'm forgiven.

91
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:21,130
She hasn't got anywhere else to go.

92
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:26,595
Take her if she wants to go.

93
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,586
Thank you.

94
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,960
What should I say?

95
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,345
Won't you say that I was innocent even now?

96
00:12:00,883 --> 00:12:04,032
You're not innocent, Waqar.

97
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,958
But you're no longer the one who's wronged Nano.

98
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,650
You had your reasons...

99
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,903
Don't worry.

100
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:21,108
You'd be acquitted if I said it to Nano.

101
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:45,043
Be happy that the next death's been postponed.

102
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,540
Why is she like that, Wali?

103
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,186
Like what?

104
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,061
Just once did he say, 'Come with me',

105
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,552
And she agreed?

106
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,740
It'd hurt you if I said something, Neelam...

107
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,058
Just say the truth, Wali.

108
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,465
It may be bitter,

109
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:09,422
But it wouldn't hurt me.

110
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,700
They love each other,

111
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,017
And Gulrez...

112
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:25,817
Gulrez had just jumped in to die...

113
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,590
Why didn't you get married?

114
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,528
Nano thinks you'd have a few kids by now.

115
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,300
And the eldest one would be

116
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,725
About five years old?

117
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:11,819
That's one thing I like about you.

118
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:14,582
You didn't get married.

119
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,395
You're staying here, aren't you?

120
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:29,489
I won't leave again.

121
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:33,959
Good for you.

122
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,330
You'd get your wish -

123
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,699
Become the chief of the gang and all...

124
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,728
Waqar Ahmed?

125
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,244
Come.

126
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,764
What were the portly guards at the gate doing?

127
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:57,014
Why didn't the wretches shoot him?

128
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:02,012
If you'd rather have an innocent man shot,

129
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:04,550
How'd you face Dad, Dado?

130
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,273
There, now!

131
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:09,910
The enemy's broken through the gates!

132
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:12,673
Dado...

133
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,042
Don't you dare touch my feet!

134
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:19,734
I walk on these two feet

135
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:23,254
To Gulrez Akhtar's grave!

136
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,526
And you!

137
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:28,920
Why did you bring him here?

138
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:34,141
Whoever's he to you?

139
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,888
He's my Uncle's son.

140
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,310
My cousin, Nano.

141
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,430
Get him out of here, Mehrunnisa!

142
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,472
Hand him a copy of the will

143
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:58,270
And say,

144
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,344
'Even a hundred years of your weeping'

145
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:06,962
'Will fail to moisten our arid eyes'!

146
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,850
He's not going out, Nano...

147
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,666
The poor man's innocent.

148
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:34,881
He'd been... Led astray...

149
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:40,459
Jiya had a diary just like mine made,

150
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:44,116
Had someone write what she wanted in my handwriting,

151
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:48,393
And kept it before his eyes for him to read.

152
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,047
If you read what Jiya had had written in the diary,

153
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:59,141
You, too, would feel that Maheen's cheating on Waqar!

154
00:20:01,488 --> 00:20:04,455
He's got Jiya's recording.

155
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,113
I've listened to it.

156
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,612
It's all Jiya's fault.

157
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,340
Why did Jiya do all of this?

158
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:22,180
Jiya's gotten even

159
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,519
With Dad through me...

160
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:27,998
Who's Jiya?

161
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,590
Tehmina Khatun's daughter.

162
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,936
Her only child.

163
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:49,120
But <i>you</i> loved her, Waqar Ahmed!

164
00:20:54,375 --> 00:21:00,155
Is the faith of those who love so frail?

165
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:04,448
Cared to ask him that?

166
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:09,759
Only the Lord will ask him about that, Nano!

167
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,176
What does he want now?

168
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,010
He's come to ask for forgiveness.

169
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,030
Alright.

170
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,856
Tell him I forgive him.

171
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:36,184
He may meet the others before leaving

172
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:39,728
He may come again

173
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:42,450
After I'm gone.

174
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,935
He's grown on Dastoor Ahmed.

175
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,790
Mehrunnisa,

176
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,011
Give me the yellow pill.

177
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,881
You take the yellow pill at night, Nano.

178
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:11,600
Why'd I take it at night

179
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,735
When I'm having <i>this headache</i> right now?

180
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:19,657
Forgive me, Dado...

181
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,082
For Gulrez's sake, forgive me...

182
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:39,988
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

183
00:22:39,988 --> 00:23:03,052
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

184
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,139
Hello?

185
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,268
You're right, Wali.

186
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,885
She never loved Gulrez.

187
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,442
Neelam...

188
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,941
I've read both her diaries.

189
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,812
Hello? Neelam?

190
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,094
She's furious.

191
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:14,313
Just wait.

192
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:17,858
She may kick him any moment.

193
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,747
No, but there's an occasional grey hair on his head.

194
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,900
He still looks dashing.

195
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,358
Not one bit old.

196
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,214
No.

197
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,895
He's staying here.

198
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:36,042
I asked him in the car.

199
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:40,044
He said, 'I won't leave again'.

200
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,677
Obviously.

201
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,918
There's no grief left,

202
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,953
Nor any complaints of him.

203
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:52,778
'After all', I thought, 'He's my cousin'.

204
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:56,520
I'd have to listen to him if he became the chief!

205
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,127
So, I thought I'd get it straight with him.

206
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,626
Who are you talking to?

207
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,310
Ali.

208
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,807
Let me talk, too.

209
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,055
Ali...

210
00:25:11,055 --> 00:25:13,575
Talk to Waqar.

211
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,819
Hello, partner.

212
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,025
Ali...

213
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,975
Ali?

214
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,593
It got disconnected.

215
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,588
No, Waqar Ahmed,

216
00:25:33,588 --> 00:25:36,402
He hung up.

217
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,070
For a moment, I thought I'd kick him in the face,

218
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:02,764
Or call Dastoor and ask him

219
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:05,416
To call the police.

220
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:07,055
The police?

221
00:26:07,055 --> 00:26:10,363
The blighter was guilty of breaking and entering.

222
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:15,087
He may have gotten a terrorism charge on his head.

223
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,094
What's up over there?

224
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:32,901
Maheen had brought him in, with his hand in hers.

225
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,649
When the guard stopped him,

226
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,490
She scolded him,

227
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,920
'Can't you see'

228
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,378
'He's with me'?

229
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:43,004
Blimey...

230
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:46,426
I was shocked.

231
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,674
I felt as if

232
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,301
She won't even forgive him on the Day of Judgement.

233
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:55,424
As it turned out,

234
00:26:55,424 --> 00:26:59,625
She softened at the sight of him.

235
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:05,025
She's bubbling from within!

236
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,660
It's been wisely said,

237
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,660
'A girl never forgets'

238
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,666
'Her first love'.

239
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:20,925
I'm afraid of her,

240
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,514
Her fresh smile...

241
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,935
Her holding his hand for the first time...
-No, Suraiyya...

242
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:37,340
She's had mercy after hearing that story about Jiya.

243
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:42,612
She had me listen to the entire recording.

244
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:44,910
Hearing it, I felt

245
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,090
That all debts have been settled.

246
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,097
It's

247
00:27:51,097 --> 00:27:54,215
All over now.

248
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,420
Don't worry.

249
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,719
She's happy now.

250
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,925
Her gait's lively.

251
00:28:18,925 --> 00:28:24,230
She's put on a dupatta instead of a cloak again.

252
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,254
Wait and watch.

253
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:31,134
In a few days,

254
00:28:31,134 --> 00:28:34,809
She'd be back to playing cricket, too.

255
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,967
Ali would be back in about a month.

256
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,721
Fajr, too,

257
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:50,709
Would be back by next year.

258
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:54,081
She'd stay here, too.

259
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,600
That

260
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,380
Leaves us two players short...

261
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:06,850
One from their side,

262
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,056
And one from ours.

263
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,060
Are you talking about Waqar and Gulrez?

264
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,423
I'm talking about Gulrez.

265
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:20,029
That other cove, I'm just mentioning

266
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:23,653
The way that wretched Oliver Cromwell's mention

267
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:28,418
Follows King Charles'.

268
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:35,397
It'd be good riddance if he just left.

269
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:45,877
And, given how he's been treated here, hopefully, he would've left already.

270
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,076
Has he dropped her?

271
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,139
Yes.

272
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,179
Blimey, look at her...

273
00:29:57,467 --> 00:30:00,948
Got in his car so quickly.

274
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:05,997
Well, she's their responsibility.

275
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:11,229
She would've gotten in with him only if they'd allowed her.

276
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,215
Find out

277
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:19,843
If she's gotten back or if he's led her into having dinner or something.

278
00:30:19,843 --> 00:30:21,073
No.

279
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,925
She's gotten back.

280
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,400
Did you call her?

281
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:32,833
No.

282
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,115
I found out

283
00:30:36,115 --> 00:30:38,670
When he got back.

284
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,312
Got back?

285
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,006
<i>He</i> got back <i>here</i>?

286
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,143
<i>He</i> set foot <i>inside</i>?

287
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:54,276
Yes...

288
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,440
Did you have him sit?

289
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:02,177
No, Ammi Begum.

290
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:06,967
He went to his room without sitting or saying anything.

291
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,770
<i>His</i> room?

292
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,989
He --

293
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,300
The blighter's <i>here</i>!?

294
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,912
He's staying in a room at Kaneez Mahal?

295
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:21,880
Throw him out right now, Dastoor Ahmed!

296
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,635
Throw him out!

297
00:31:23,635 --> 00:31:25,593
Out!

298
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,575
Wali...

299
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:50,749
Where's Maheen?

300
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:53,360
In her room?

301
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,798
She's not in her room.

302
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,484
Alright, I'll go and check.

303
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,155
<i>Come to me</i>

304
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,829
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

305
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:13,624
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

306
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,764
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

307
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:18,570
<i>Come to me</i>

308
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,432
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

309
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:28,207
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

310
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,360
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

311
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,957
<i>Come to me</i>

312
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,620
<i>The grim reaper approaching</i>

313
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,391
<i>My life changed course towards you</i>

314
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:01,960
<i>As the evening of our separation went by </i>

315
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,990
<i>The longing to meet started stinging at me.</i>

316
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:14,278
<i>This heart grows anxious</i>

317
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:21,318
<i>This heart grows anxious</i>

318
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:26,471
<i>Pay me a visit in my dreams sometime</i>

319
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:31,740
<i>Pay me a visit in my dreams sometime</i>

320
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,471
<i>Come to me</i>

321
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:38,279
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

322
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:43,040
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

323
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,100
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

324
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,545
<i>Come to me...</i>

325
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,891
Dastoor Ahmed!

326
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:00,792
Dastoor Ahmed!

327
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,733
I was at the door.

328
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:20,733
I thought I'd be here the moment you call.

329
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,676
I'd like some tea.
-Before you've rinsed your mouth?

330
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:29,468
As if the English care about such trifles...

331
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,345
We have tea first.

332
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:36,764
Get me tea.

333
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,315
Has he left?

334
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,946
I'm talking about that blighter.

335
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:55,156
What are you looking at? Just tell me he's left.

336
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,350
There he is.

337
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,590
At your feet.

338
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:08,228
He's been there all night.

339
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,241
Good Lord...

340
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:21,814
The twit knows every trick to give someone a fright.

341
00:36:22,942 --> 00:36:25,456
Wake him up, Dastoor Ahmed.

342
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:28,702
He may get a stiff neck.

343
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,392
Waqar!

344
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,950
Get up. Ammi Begum's worried you may get a stiff neck.

345
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,266
Get up. Ammi Begum's worried you may get a stiff neck.
-<i>Just</i> wake him up.

346
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:43,929
No need to tell him what Ammi Begum says.

347
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,174
Dado...

348
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:59,284
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

349
00:36:59,457 --> 00:37:02,698
Get him out of my sights.

350
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,541
Drag him away if you have to.

351
00:37:06,813 --> 00:37:08,450
Come.

352
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:10,910
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

353
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,979
Just a second --

354
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:16,956
Just a second, Dastoor Uncle.

355
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,800
I swear by you, Dado.

356
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:36,894
If I left this time,

357
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:40,000
I'm never coming back.

358
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
