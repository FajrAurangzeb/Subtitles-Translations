1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait, Neelam.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've got something I'd want you to listen to.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Today, all of you will have to listen.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Remember when you'd told me

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I'm your brother

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just like Gulrez was your brother?

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Please, Neelam...

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just listen to me for once.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come, Wali...

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You should be here, too.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd grown quite close to Maheen...

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But as soon as I found out

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>That he was her father...</i>

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The man

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who'd destroyed

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My family...

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I decided to get even with him...

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Sometimes,

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd pity her...

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But then,

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd listen to Mum's recorded cassettes

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All my love for Maheen

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would change into bitter hatred.

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd long thought

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Of killing Maheen with the same weapon

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had been used to kill Mum...

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her handwriting...

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The diary...

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen's diary...

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i>

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes</i>

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes
All day, all night...</i>

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All day, all night...

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be lost in that diary of hers...

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At last, I found the man for the job...

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That bloke

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Was quite the expert...

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He just

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Needed one look at someone's handwriting

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To create an exact copy...

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then...

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I --

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I looked for another diary.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had him write the content I wanted...

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Maheen's diary' lying on the table...

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Getting her

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And her family

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out of their house...

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And then provoking

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Someone like you

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So much that you couldn't resist reading the diary...

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But my hard work...

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My hard work...

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Opened the door to every success...

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you were the best of them all.</i>

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You took the diary along, too!

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I regret

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I've ruined Maheen,

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But I'm glad that I've avenged Mum.

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I loved Maheen so much,

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And I'd battled myself to get to despise that love,

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But when I'd won, I felt so much pity for Maheen

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That I thought I'd call her,

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And tell her that when we, enmeshed in unexpected trials, ask what our fault had been,

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It helps to know

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That besides the property,

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One inherits the debt of the sins of one's father,

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, regrettably,

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It is the upright children who have to pay it back.

72
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can come out now, Dad.

73
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your debts have been settled.

74
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've paid it back with the blood of my yearnings.

75
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I...

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Your daughter...

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen Aurangzeb?

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You don't need to worry about anything.

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Enjoy yourself.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Feel free to keep sinning.

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When it's time to expiate,

82
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The kids will take care of it, of course.

83
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Otherwise, what good would your kids be?

84
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a minute, Neelam...

85
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Allow me.

86
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I want to take Maheen along.

87
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where?

88
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Dado's.

89
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't get forgiven without her testimony.

90
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I promise I'll leave her here once I'm forgiven.

91
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She hasn't got anywhere else to go.

92
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take her if she wants to go.

93
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you.

94
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What should I say?

95
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Won't you say that I was innocent even now?

96
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're not innocent, Waqar.

97
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you're no longer the one who's wronged Nano.

98
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You had your reasons...

99
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd be acquitted if I said it to Nano.

101
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Be happy that the next death's been postponed.

102
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why is she like that, Wali?

103
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Like what?

104
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just once did he say, 'Come with me',

105
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And she agreed?

106
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd hurt you if I said something, Neelam...

107
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just say the truth, Wali.

108
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It may be bitter,

109
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But it wouldn't hurt me.

110
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They love each other,

111
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And Gulrez...

112
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Gulrez had just jumped in to die...

113
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't you get married?

114
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nano thinks you'd have a few kids by now.

115
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And the eldest one would be

116
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
About five years old?

117
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's one thing I like about you.

118
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You didn't get married.

119
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're staying here, aren't you?

120
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I won't leave again.

121
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good for you.

122
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You'd get your wish -

123
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Become the chief of the gang and all...

124
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar Ahmed?

125
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

126
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What were the portly guards at the gate doing?

127
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why didn't the wretches shoot him?

128
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you'd rather have an innocent man shot,

129
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
How'd you face Dad, Dado?

130
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There, now!

131
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The enemy's broken through the gates!

132
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

133
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't you dare touch my feet!

134
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I walk on these two feet

135
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To Gulrez Akhtar's grave!

136
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And you!

137
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did you bring him here?

138
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoever's he to you?

139
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's my Uncle's son.

140
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My cousin, Nano.

141
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get him out of here, Mehrunnisa!

142
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hand him a copy of the will

143
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And say,

144
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Even a hundred years of your weeping'

145
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Will fail to moisten our arid eyes'!

146
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's not going out, Nano...

147
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The poor man's innocent.

148
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He'd been... Led astray...

149
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya had a diary just like mine made,

150
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Had someone write what she wanted in my handwriting,

151
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And kept it before his eyes for him to read.

152
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you read what Jiya had had written in the diary,

153
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You, too, would feel that Maheen's cheating on Waqar!

154
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got Jiya's recording.

155
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've listened to it.

156
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's all Jiya's fault.

157
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why did Jiya do all of this?

158
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Jiya's gotten even

159
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
With Dad through me...

160
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who's Jiya?

161
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tehmina Khatun's daughter.

162
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her only child.

163
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>But you loved her, Waqar Ahmed!</i>

164
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Is the faith of those who love so frail?

165
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Cared to ask him that?

166
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Only the Lord will ask him about that, Nano!

167
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What does he want now?

168
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's come to ask for forgiveness.

169
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright.

170
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Tell him I forgive him.

171
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may meet the others before leaving

172
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may come again

173
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
After I'm gone.

174
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's grown on Dastoor Ahmed.

175
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Mehrunnisa,

176
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Give me the yellow pill.

177
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You take the yellow pill at night, Nano.

178
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Why'd I take it at night

179
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>When I'm having this headache right now?</i>

180
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Forgive me, Dado...

181
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For Gulrez's sake, forgive me...

182
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Thus, before reaching the destination, I choose to take a detour</i>

183
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>For those we hold dear to us are the ones who break our heart</i>

184
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello?

185
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're right, Wali.

186
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She never loved Gulrez.

187
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Neelam...

188
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I've read both her diaries.

189
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello? Neelam?

190
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's furious.

191
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just wait.

192
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She may kick him any moment.

193
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, but there's an occasional grey hair on his head.

194
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He still looks dashing.

195
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Not one bit old.

196
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

197
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's staying here.

198
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I asked him in the car.

199
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He said, 'I won't leave again'.

200
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Obviously.

201
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There's no grief left,

202
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Nor any complaints of him.

203
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'After all', I thought, 'He's my cousin'.

204
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd have to listen to him if he became the chief!

205
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So, I thought I'd get it straight with him.

206
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Who are you talking to?

207
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali.

208
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Let me talk, too.

209
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali...

210
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Talk to Waqar.

211
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hello, partner.

212
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali...

213
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali?

214
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It got disconnected.

215
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Waqar Ahmed,

216
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He hung up.

217
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
For a moment, I thought I'd kick him in the face,

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Or call Dastoor and ask him

219
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
To call the police.

220
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The police?

221
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The blighter was guilty of breaking and entering.

222
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may have gotten a terrorism charge on his head.

223
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What's up over there?

224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Maheen had brought him in, with his hand in hers.

225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When the guard stopped him,

226
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She scolded him,

227
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Can't you see'

228
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'He's with me'?

229
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey...

230
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was shocked.

231
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I felt as if

232
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She won't even forgive him on the Day of Judgement.

233
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As it turned out,

234
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She softened at the sight of him.

235
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's bubbling from within!

236
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's been wisely said,

237
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'A girl never forgets'

238
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
'Her first love'.

239
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm afraid of her,

240
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her fresh smile...

241
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her holding his hand for the first time...
-No, Suraiyya...

242
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's had mercy after hearing that story about Jiya.

243
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She had me listen to the entire recording.

244
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hearing it, I felt

245
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That all debts have been settled.

246
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's

247
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All over now.

248
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Don't worry.

249
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's happy now.

250
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Her gait's lively.

251
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's put on a dupatta instead of a cloak again.

252
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wait and watch.

253
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In a few days,

254
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd be back to playing cricket, too.

255
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Ali would be back in about a month.

256
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Fajr, too,

257
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Would be back by next year.

258
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She'd stay here, too.

259
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That

260
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Leaves us two players short...

261
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
One from their side,

262
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And one from ours.

263
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Are you talking about Waqar and Gulrez?

264
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about Gulrez.

265
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That other cove, I'm just mentioning

266
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The way that wretched Oliver Cromwell's mention

267
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Follows King Charles'.

268
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It'd be good riddance if he just left.

269
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And, given how he's been treated here, hopefully, he would've left already.

270
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he dropped her?

271
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

272
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Blimey, look at her...

273
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got in his car so quickly.

274
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Well, she's their responsibility.

275
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She would've gotten in with him only if they'd allowed her.

276
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Find out

277
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If she's gotten back or if he's led her into having dinner or something.

278
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

279
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's gotten back.

280
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you call her?

281
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No.

282
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I found out

283
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When he got back.

284
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Got back?

285
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He got back here?</i>

286
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>He set foot inside?</i>

287
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes...

288
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you have him sit?

289
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No, Ammi Begum.

290
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He went to his room without sitting or saying anything.

291
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>His room?</i>

292
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He --

293
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The blighter's here!?</i>

294
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's staying in a room at Kaneez Mahal?

295
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw him out right now, Dastoor Ahmed!

296
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Throw him out!

297
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Out!

298
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wali...

299
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Where's Maheen?

300
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In her room?

301
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
She's not in her room.

302
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Alright, I'll go and check.

303
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come to me</i>

304
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

305
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

306
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

307
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come to me</i>

308
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

309
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

310
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

311
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come to me</i>

312
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The grim reaper approaching</i>

313
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My life changed course towards you</i>

314
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>As the evening of our separation went by </i>

315
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>The longing to meet started stinging at me.</i>

316
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This heart grows anxious</i>

317
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>This heart grows anxious</i>

318
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pay me a visit in my dreams sometime</i>

319
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Pay me a visit in my dreams sometime</i>

320
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come to me</i>

321
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>My heart beckons to you</i>

322
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Weary of weeping and wailing</i>

323
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Save my love from this calumny</i>

324
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Come to me...</i>

325
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed!

326
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dastoor Ahmed!

327
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was at the door.

328
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I thought I'd be here the moment you call.

329
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like some tea.
-Before you've rinsed your mouth?

330
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
As if the English care about such trifles...

331
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
We have tea first.

332
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get me tea.

333
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has he left?

334
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm talking about that blighter.

335
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at? Just tell me he's left.

336
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
There he is.

337
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At your feet.

338
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's been there all night.

339
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Good Lord...

340
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The twit knows every trick to give someone a fright.

341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Wake him up, Dastoor Ahmed.

342
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He may get a stiff neck.

343
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Waqar!

344
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get up. Ammi Begum's worried you may get a stiff neck.

345
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Get up. Ammi Begum's worried you may get a stiff neck.
-Just wake him up.</i>

346
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
No need to tell him what Ammi Begum says.

347
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dado...

348
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

349
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Get him out of my sights.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Drag him away if you have to.

351
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Come.

352
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

353
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second --

354
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Just a second, Dastoor Uncle.

355
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I swear by you, Dado.

356
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If I left this time,

357
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm never coming back.

358
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
