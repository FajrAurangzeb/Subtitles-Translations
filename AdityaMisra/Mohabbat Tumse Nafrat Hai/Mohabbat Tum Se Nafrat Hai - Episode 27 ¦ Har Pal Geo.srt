1
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,977
Wait, Neelam.

2
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,589
I've got something I'd want you to listen to.

3
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,237
Today, all of you will have to listen.

4
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,662
Remember when you'd told me

5
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,610
That I'm your brother

6
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:25,655
Just like Gulrez was your brother?

7
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,104
Please, Neelam...

8
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,025
Just listen to me for once.

9
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,674
Come, Wali...

10
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,122
You should be here, too.

11
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,389
I'd grown quite close to Maheen...

12
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:58,258
But as soon as I found out

13
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:01,212
That <i>he</i> was her father...

14
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,577
The man

15
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:05,983
Who'd destroyed

16
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,077
My family...

17
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:13,627
I decided to get even with him...

18
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,765
Sometimes,

19
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,932
I'd pity her...

20
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,428
But then,

21
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,962
I'd listen to Mum's recorded cassettes

22
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:33,773
And

23
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,975
All my love for Maheen

24
00:03:36,975 --> 00:03:39,658
Would change into bitter hatred.

25
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,688
I'd long thought

26
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:49,074
Of killing Maheen with the same weapon

27
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,977
That

28
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,692
Had been used to kill Mum...

29
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,620
Her handwriting...

30
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,845
Her diary...

31
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,131
Maheen's diary...

32
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:47,114
♪ <i>Love's testimony is not to be asked of it</i> ♪

33
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:59,980
♪ <i>It pulls out tears and drops them from the eyes...</i> ♪

34
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,950
All day, all night...

35
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,865
She'd be lost in that diary of hers...

36
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:09,861
At last, I found the man for the job...

37
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,118
That poor bloke

38
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,286
Was quite the expert...

39
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,301
He just

40
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,950
Needed one look at someone's handwriting

41
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,958
To create an exact copy...

42
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,847
And then...

43
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,395
I --

44
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:44,654
I looked for another diary.

45
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:55,010
Had him write the content I wanted...

46
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:59,606
'Maheen's diary' lying on the table...

47
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,319
Getting her

48
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,489
And her family

49
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:18,988
Out of their house...

50
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,670
And then provoking

51
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,731
Someone like you

52
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:33,765
So much that you couldn't resist reading the diary...

53
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,057
But my hard work...

54
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,938
My hard work...

55
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,180
Opened the door to every success...

56
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,594
But <i>you</i> were the best of them all.

57
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,946
You took the diary along, too!

58
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:11,687
I regret

59
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,937
That I've ruined Maheen,

60
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:20,463
But I'm glad that I've avenged Mum.

61
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,167
I loved Maheen so much,

62
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:32,293
And I'd battled myself to get to despise that love,

63
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,860
But when I'd won, I felt so much pity for Maheen

64
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,652
That I thought I'd call her,

65
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:50,780
And tell her that when we, enmeshed in unexpected trials, ask what our fault had been,

66
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:54,960
It helps to know

67
00:07:55,037 --> 00:07:58,455
That besides the property,

68
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:03,256
One inherits the debt of the sins of one's father,

69
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,054
And, regrettably,

70
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:11,899
It is the upright children who have to pay it back.

71
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,962
You can come out now, Dad.

72
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:31,096
Your debts have been settled.

73
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,098
I've paid it back with the blood of my yearnings.

74
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,392
I...

75
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,707
Your daughter...

76
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:46,451
Maheen Aurangzeb?

77
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,882
You don't need to worry about anything.

78
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,773
Enjoy yourself.

79
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:02,611
Feel free to keep sinning.

80
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,585
When it's time to expiate,

81
00:10:07,054 --> 00:10:09,892
You can always count on the kids...

82
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,167
What good are kids if you can't count on them?

83
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,026
Just a minute, Neelam...

84
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,148
Allow me.

85
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,349
I want to take Maheen along.

86
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,546
Where?

87
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:07,091
To Dado's.

88
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:12,829
I won't get forgiven without her testimony.

89
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:16,495
I promise I'll leave her here once I'm forgiven.

90
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,070
She hasn't got anywhere else to go.

91
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:25,583
Take her if she wants to go.

92
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,947
Thank you.

93
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,308
What should I say?

94
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,202
Won't you say that I was innocent even now?

95
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,475
You're not innocent, Waqar.

96
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:08,430
But you're no longer the one who's wronged Nano.

97
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,207
You had your reasons...

98
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,415
Don't worry.

99
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:20,251
You'd be acquitted if I said it to Nano.

100
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,734
Be happy that the next death's been postponed.

101
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,303
Why is she like that, Wali?

102
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,926
Like what?

103
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:51,859
Just once did he say, 'Come with me',

104
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,121
And she agreed?

105
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,306
It'd hurt you if I said something, Neelam...

106
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,579
Just say the truth, Wali.

107
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,267
It may be bitter,

108
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,745
But it wouldn't hurt me.

109
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,873
They love each other,

110
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,479
And Gulrez...

111
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,032
Gulrez had just jumped in to die...

112
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,911
Why didn't you get married?

113
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:03,319
Nano thinks you'd have a few kids by now.

114
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,108
And the eldest one would be

115
00:14:05,108 --> 00:14:07,189
About five years old?

116
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,971
That's one thing I like about you.

117
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,832
You didn't get married.

118
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,529
You're staying here, aren't you?

119
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,987
I won't leave again.

120
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,550
Good for you.

121
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:36,055
You'd get your wish -

122
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:39,061
Become the chief of the gang and all...

123
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:00,125
Waqar Ahmed?

124
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,919
Come.

125
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,361
What were the portly guards at the gate doing?

126
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,305
Why didn't the wretches shoot him?

127
00:17:57,316 --> 00:18:00,344
If you'd rather have an innocent man shot,

128
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,322
How'd you face Dad, Dado?

129
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:05,966
There, now!

130
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:09,291
The enemy's broken through the gates!

131
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,525
Dado...

132
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,446
Don't you dare touch my feet!

133
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,549
I walk on these two feet

134
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:22,906
To Gulrez Akhtar's grave!

135
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,369
And you!

136
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,215
Why did you bring him here?

137
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,662
Whoever's he to you?

138
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,540
He's my Uncle's son.

139
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,718
My cousin, Nano.

140
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,810
Get him out of here, Mehrunnisa!

141
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,312
Hand him a copy of the will

142
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,913
And say,

143
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:01,989
'Even a hundred years of your weeping'

144
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:06,857
'Will fail to moisten our arid eyes'!

145
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,392
He's not going out, Nano...

146
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,797
The poor man's innocent.

147
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:34,360
He'd been... Led astray...

148
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,483
Jiya had a diary just like mine made,

149
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,845
Had someone write what she wanted in my handwriting,

150
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:47,318
And kept it before his eyes for him to read.

151
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,471
If you read what Jiya had had written in the diary,

152
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:57,489
You, too, would feel that Maheen's cheating on Waqar!

153
00:20:01,265 --> 00:20:04,097
He's got Jiya's recording.

154
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,958
I've listened to it.

155
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:11,963
It's all Jiya's fault.

156
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:15,840
Why did Jiya do all of this?

157
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,435
Jiya's gotten even

158
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,563
With Dad through me...

159
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,660
Who's Jiya?

160
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,630
Lady Tehmina's daughter.

161
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,332
Her only child.

162
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,203
But <i>you</i> loved her, Waqar Ahmed!

163
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,623
Is the faith of those who love so frail?

164
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,730
Cared to ask him that?

165
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:08,931
Only the Lord will ask him about that, Nano!

166
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:17,397
What does he want now?

167
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,835
He's come to ask for forgiveness.

168
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,674
Alright.

169
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,949
Tell him I forgive him.

170
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,553
He may meet the others before leaving.

171
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,497
He may come back

172
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,817
After I'm gone.

173
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,390
He's grown on Dastoor Ahmed.

174
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,803
Mehrunnisa,

175
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,543
Give me the yellow pill.

176
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,532
You take the yellow pill at night, Nano.

177
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,395
Why'd I take it at night

178
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:14,924
When I've got this headache right <i>now</i>?

179
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,242
Forgive me, Dado...

180
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,388
For Gulrez's sake, forgive me...

Hello?

186
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,911
You're right, Wali.

187
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,295
She never loved Gulrez.

188
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:26,092
Neelam...

189
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,516
I've read both her diaries.

190
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,416
Hello? Neelam?

191
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,845
She's furious.

192
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,115
Just wait.

193
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:17,238
She may kick him any moment.

194
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,246
No, but there's an occasional grey hair on his head.

195
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,684
He still looks dashing.

196
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,839
Not one bit old.

197
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,917
No.

198
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,429
He's staying here.

199
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:35,514
I asked him in the car.

200
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,642
He said, 'I won't leave again'.

201
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:44,286
Obviously.

202
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,656
There's no grief left,

203
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:49,245
Nor any complaints of him.

204
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:52,429
'After all', I thought, 'He's my cousin'.

205
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:56,420
I'd have to listen to him if he became the Chief!

206
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:58,813
So, I thought I'd get it straight with him.

207
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,925
Who are you talking to?

208
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:04,098
Ali.

209
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,405
Let me talk, too.

210
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,557
Ali...

211
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,940
Talk to Waqar.

212
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,232
Hello, partner.

213
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,815
Ali...

214
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,647
Ali?

215
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,130
Got disconnected, I guess.

216
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,966
No, Waqar Ahmed,

217
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,558
He hung up.

218
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:58,003
For a moment, I thought I'd kick him in the face,

219
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:02,548
Or call Dastoor and ask him

220
00:26:02,702 --> 00:26:05,005
To call the police.

221
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,779
The police?

222
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,193
The blighter was guilty of breaking and entering.

223
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,181
He may have gotten a terrorism charge on his head.

224
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,673
What was that?

225
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,647
Maheen had brought him in, with his hand in hers.

226
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:35,480
When the guard stopped him,

227
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,286
She scolded him,

228
00:26:37,286 --> 00:26:38,791
'Can't you see'

229
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:41,057
'He's with me'?

230
00:26:41,134 --> 00:26:42,736
Blimey...

231
00:26:43,005 --> 00:26:45,852
I was shocked.

232
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,405
I felt as if

233
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,083
She won't even forgive him on the Day of Judgement.

234
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:55,199
As it turned out,

235
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:59,003
She softened at the sight of the twit.

236
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:04,456
She's bubbling from within!

237
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:10,618
It's been wisely said,

238
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:14,465
'A girl never forgets'

239
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,905
'Her first love'.

240
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,459
I'm afraid of her,

241
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,236
Her fresh smile...

242
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,609
Her holding his hand for the first time...
-No, Suraiyya...

243
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:36,911
She's had mercy after hearing that story about Jiya.

244
00:27:37,943 --> 00:27:41,976
She had me listen to the entire recording.

245
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,722
Hearing it, I felt

246
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:47,585
That all debts have been settled.

247
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:49,285
It's

248
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,252
All over now.

249
00:27:54,016 --> 00:27:55,990
Don't worry.

250
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,011
She's happy now.

251
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:18,289
Her gait's lively.

252
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:23,690
She's put on a dupatta instead of a cloak again.

253
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,384
Wait and watch.

254
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:29,987
In a few days,

255
00:28:30,907 --> 00:28:34,306
She'd be back to playing cricket, too.

256
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:41,941
Ali would be back in about a month.

257
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,605
Fajr, too,

258
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,196
Would be back by next year.

259
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,439
She'd stay here, too.

260
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:57,279
That

261
00:28:58,454 --> 00:29:01,743
Leaves us two players short...

262
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,505
One from their side,

263
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:09,446
And one from ours.

264
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,800
Are you talking about Waqar and Gulrez?

265
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,803
I'm talking about Gulrez.

266
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,774
That other cove, I'm just mentioning

267
00:29:19,774 --> 00:29:23,466
The way that wretched King Charles' mention

268
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:28,160
Follows Oliver Cromwell's.

269
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,280
It'd be good riddance if he just left.

270
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:45,496
And, given how he's been treated here, hopefully, he would've left already.

271
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,503
Has he dropped her?

272
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,886
Yes.

273
00:29:54,278 --> 00:29:56,648
Blimey, look at her...

274
00:29:57,224 --> 00:30:01,100
Got in his car so quickly.

275
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:05,554
Well, she's their responsibility.

276
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:10,337
She would've gotten in with him only if they'd allowed her.

277
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,471
Find out

278
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:19,091
If she got back or if he's led her into having dinner or something.

279
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:20,833
No.

280
00:30:20,894 --> 00:30:23,214
She got back.

281
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,902
Did you call her?

282
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:32,274
No.

283
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,645
I found out

284
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:38,262
When he got back.

285
00:30:38,417 --> 00:30:40,955
Got back?

286
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:44,692
<i>He</i> got back <i>here</i>?

287
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,579
<i>He</i> set foot <i>inside</i>?

288
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,918
Yes...

289
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,950
Did you have him sit?

290
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:01,728
No, Ammi Begum.

291
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,458
He went to his room without sitting or saying anything.

292
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,450
<i>His</i> room?

293
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:12,712
He --

294
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:15,119
The blighter's <i>here</i>!?

295
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:18,649
He's staying in a room at Kaneez Mahal?

296
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:21,720
Throw him out right now, Dastoor Ahmed!

297
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,436
Throw him out!

298
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,075
Out!

299
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,949
Wali...

300
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:50,280
Where's Maheen?

301
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,213
In her room?

302
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,310
She's not in her room.

303
00:31:55,823 --> 00:31:58,076
Alright, I'll go and check.

00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:00,438
Dastoor Ahmed!

328
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,443
I was at the door.

329
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,719
I thought I'd be here the moment you call.

330
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:24,500
I'd like some tea.
-Before you've rinsed your mouth?

331
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,095
As if the English care about such trifles...

332
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:33,957
We have tea first.

333
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,379
Tea...

334
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,931
Has he left?

335
00:35:45,016 --> 00:35:48,272
I'm talking about that blighter.

336
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,153
What are you looking at? Just tell me he's left.

337
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,145
There he is.

338
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:03,049
At your feet.

339
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:07,311
He's been there all night.

340
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,812
Good Lord...

341
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:21,067
The twit knows every trick to give someone a fright.

342
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:25,178
Wake him up, Dastoor Ahmed.

343
00:36:25,271 --> 00:36:27,858
He may get a stiff neck.

344
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,982
Waqar!

345
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:36,930
Get up. Ammi Begum's worried you may get a stiff neck.

346
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:39,120
<i>Just</i> wake him up.

347
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,076
Never mind what Ammi Begum says.

348
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,894
Dado...

349
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,546
What are you looking at, Dastoor Ahmed?

350
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,988
Get him out of my sights.

351
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,909
Drag him away if you have to.

352
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,086
Come.

353
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,660
Take it that you're not getting forgiven.

354
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,626
Just a second --

355
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,490
Just a second, Uncle Dastoor.

356
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,312
I swear by you, Dado.

357
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,949
If I left this time,

358
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,470
I'm never coming back.

359
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
