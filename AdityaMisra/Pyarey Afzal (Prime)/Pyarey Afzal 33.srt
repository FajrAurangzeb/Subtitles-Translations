1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,840
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,130
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,229
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:30,619
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,079
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,830
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,070
He's here, Jasmine.

8
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,300
He looks so handsome!

9
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,306
I swear!

10
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,020
Won't you wish me peace today?

11
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,680
I won't today.

12
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,916
How do I look?

13
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,600
The sweetest;

14
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,727
The best. ['Afzal']

15
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,296
Come.

16
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:04,460
It's time for the engagement.

17
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,240
Come on, my dear, it's getting late.

18
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,010
Greetings.

19
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,550
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur Ibrahim!
-And upon you, peace.

20
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,220
Congratulations!

21
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,840
To you as well.

22
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,886
Come.

23
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,320
I've

24
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,040
Brought the old ring.

25
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,070
Farah had said

26
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,310
That she'd only wear this one today.

27
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,366
Alright, Reverend. Come.

28
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,837
Here, Jasmine. Place the ring on him.

29
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,191
Congratulations!

30
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,420
Afzal, place the ring on her now.

31
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,428
Sir!

32
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,887
Here.

33
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,600
Your turn now, Monsieur.

34
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
No, Monseigneur.

35
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,740
It is my request

36
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,920
That Reverend Subhanallah should be the one

37
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,848
To place the ring on my daughter on my behalf.

38
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,166
Me --?

39
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,221
No -- I -- I'm nobody.

40
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,332
Come on, Reverend.

41
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:17,080
When you call her your daughter, it makes you her father.

42
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,977
Come.

43
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,323
<i>Every compeer</i>

44
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:36,740
<i>Every compeer</i>

45
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:42,350
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

46
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

47
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,460
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

48
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,080
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

49
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,260
<i>I found even my own shadow</i>

50
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,510
<i>Apathetic and blasé</i>

51
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,099
<i>Who were those people</i>

52
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:22,201
<i>Who won their love?</i>

53
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,216
Reverend!

54
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,280
He's had a heart attack.

55
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,070
A very severe one.

56
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,020
Come here.

57
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,797
Sit by me.

58
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,270
Don't worry.

59
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,590
A son's attack strikes worse than a heart attack.

60
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,420
Nothing happened then, and I'm sure nothing will happen to him now.

61
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,700
Hey! Stop crying.

62
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,067
Else I'd think the Reverend's words and deeds are contradictory.

63
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,660
It's just a heart attack, isn't it?

64
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,720
Everything else is alright...?

65
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,830
Yes, everything else is alright.

66
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,666
Alright.

67
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,260
You heard that?

68
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,556
I know the Reverend well enough.

69
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,020
It's been 28 years

70
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,426
He's never been into knavery with me.

71
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,190
Don't think

72
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,900
He tripped because of the heart attack.

73
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,420
No, no, it was something else...

74
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,140
You raised your hand to wear the ring

75
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,260
He must've thought you're pointing your finger at him.

76
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,907
He must've remembered his coconut biscuits...

77
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,180
The poor lass gets so worried.

78
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,070
She lacks that belief

79
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,130
Despite the fact that the Reverend had said to her,

80
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,860
'Arifa',

81
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,250
'If you pray and yet worry',

82
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,420
'It means you don't have faith in He who shall accept it'.

83
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,731
'Accursed be such a prayer'.

84
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,210
Come here, Madame.

85
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,067
Please, sit.

86
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,190
As he was getting ready for the engagement,

87
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,580
I thought for a while I'd stop him.

88
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,690
That I say, 'Reverend, it's not propitious for you to attend engagements'.

89
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,810
But then

90
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,940
Thinking of his friendship with Farah, I stayed quiet.

91
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,850
Thought he'd feel about it if he did not go.

92
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,220
Once he gets well,

93
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,510
Please don't invite him to the next engagement.

94
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,140
What are you saying?

95
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,940
Only what's right.

96
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,860
The thing is, it hurt a little to know about Afzal's engagement.

97
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,710
That he did not invite us.

98
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,630
But I was relieved,

99
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,280
Because if he'd gone there,

100
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,461
That engagement would never have happened, if the Lord thus willed.

101
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,830
Why don't you ask, Monseigneur?

102
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,851
He must've come to by now.

103
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,710
How's he, Doctor?

104
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,140
Blessed be you; he's regained consciousness.

105
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,680
Thank God!

106
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,150
There!

107
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,610
He's come to.

108
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,960
I'd known it.

109
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,180
He'd come to right away.

110
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,200
You'll see,

111
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,980
He'll ask the moment he gets up

112
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,660
If she's been engaged.

113
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,636
He'll be happy that the engagement's been postponed.

114
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:04,770
I saw you here for the first time.

115
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,880
My heart...

116
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,420
Felt something when I saw you.

117
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,266
I hope you understand what 'something' means to a girl?

118
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:21,220
She feels it'll kill her to control her heart.

119
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,230
You did the right thing in getting engaged to me.

120
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,037
I was lost, Afzal.

121
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,720
As you turn away your gaze, it seems you're rueful about yourself.

122
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,400
I know why.

123
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,580
You didn't invite your parents.

124
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,670
That explains it, doesn't it?

125
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,620
Yes.

126
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,146
Yes.
-Then why didn't you invite them?

127
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,140
They'd never have come.

128
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,860
Especially Dad.

129
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,070
Mum and Arifa would have, then.

130
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,090
You don't know Mum.

131
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,850
When she talks,

132
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,270
She's Afzal's mother.

133
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,370
When she pronounces a judgement,

134
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,780
She's Reverend Subhanallah's wife.

135
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,810
They must've come to know.

136
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,990
No.

137
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,480
They don't know.

138
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,106
They do.

139
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,050
They called me.

140
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,410
She was on the rack because of you.

141
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,120
This is an old habit of yours, Afzal.

142
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,280
You torment the one

143
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,600
Who feels torment for you.

144
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Who gave them your number?

145
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,490
I don't know.

146
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,070
They must've found out somehow.

147
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,440
Those who want to look do eventually find out, Afzal.

148
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,270
I'm wicked, Jasmine...

149
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,850
That's the second time I've struck them.

150
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,680
Mum must've teared up and Dad must've put his hand over his heart.

151
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,100
But he won't weep before anyone.

152
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,150
Give me your address.

153
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,370
I'd promised them to come right after the engagement.

154
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,380
If you don't, I'll call and ask them.

155
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,650
And this - I've just asked permission to go.

156
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,140
May I?

157
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,350
No.

158
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,610
Not now.

159
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,010
Keep up with these orders after the marriage.

160
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,910
For now, behave like a fiancé.

161
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,140
Yes, Timmy?

162
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,090
A -- Eladio called from Hyderabad.

163
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,947
Bad news, Afzal.

164
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,710
Go on.

165
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,987
It's --

166
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,190
T --

167
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,450
The Reverend's had a heart attack.

168
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,000
The doctors have sent me outside.

169
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,510
'Not now', they said.

170
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:20,390
Just see him for now, and leave.

171
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,556
I've seen him.

172
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:27,170
He, too, got a bit embarrassed when he saw me.

173
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,890
Turned his gaze away momentarily.

174
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,680
Why was he embarrassed?

175
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,330
He used to think I'd be the one to have a heart attack.

176
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,590
I used to place my hand over my heart in agony,

177
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,660
And he'd call the doctor that instant.

178
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,180
And now...

179
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,726
His heart couldn't take it...

180
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:55,430
He doesn't let it show up on his face.

181
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,870
Why should it, really...

182
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,380
He doesn't let what's in his heart come on his face.
-Mum...

183
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,760
Right here.

184
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,030
His sweet little one's feeling bad about me remembering all of this.

185
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,960
But I will say everything.

186
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,900
Your Dad's been hollow-hearted.

187
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,941
How?

188
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,720
Once, he said to me,

189
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,860
'We've given our hearts to each other'.

190
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,720
'So, what does that mean'?

191
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,580
I asked what it meant,

192
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,210
And he said,

193
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,540
'If an affliction strikes my heart',

194
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,460
'I'll take it to mean that you didn't keep it safe from harm'.

195
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,860
And this --

196
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,710
This heart attack he's had

197
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,660
It's not that he's had this attack

198
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,730
My heart's the one afflicted.

199
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,030
You will see

200
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,770
Once he gets back home,

201
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,650
It'll be said plainly.

202
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,520
I'll say,

203
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,907
I'll say, 'Take your heart, and give me mine back'.

204
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,576
Who are you?

205
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,860
Hello?

206
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,590
Right...

207
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,827
Here. Talk to him.

208
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,340
Hello?

209
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,520
Who's it?

210
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,716
Inspector Shamsi Rehman.

211
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,820
Let them go.

212
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,970
Who are you, sir?

213
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,716
Disconnect; I'll call your number.

214
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,350
You may proceed.
-Alright.

215
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,770
Yes sir?

216
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,980
Of course I'd recognised your voice, sir.

217
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,160
You'd said it, sir.

218
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,350
Check all who pass.

219
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,451
Alright sir. Okay.

220
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,990
There you are! Good.

221
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:16,920
It's getting late, please have something.

222
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,780
No, thank you.

223
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,360
I've vowed to have breakfast with him.

224
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,720
I've vowed too -

225
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,610
I'd give something to eat to the others only after you've had something.

226
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,370
It's up to you.

227
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,616
They'll all be hungry because of you.

228
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,816
No -- I'll have something.

229
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,140
Dad called.

230
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,660
He gave a suggestion.

231
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,040
What?

232
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,280
He said

233
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,980
The Reverend will be fine by daybreak.

234
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,250
So?

235
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,430
So --

236
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,840
Why not go forth with the engagement here?

237
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,556
I mean -- I've been carrying the ring with me, so --

238
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,290
I'd told Dad you'd not agree to it.

239
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:39,055
Enjoy the meal.

240
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,830
A --

241
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,581
Afzal?

242
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,936
Afzal?

243
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,280
Come here, my dear...

244
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,920
I've been missing you...

245
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:23,071
Come here, my child...

246
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:26,041
Afzal...

247
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,916
Child...

248
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,990
My son... Come here.

249
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,380
Come here, my dearest...

250
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,640
Is there a Mr Afzal here?

251
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,480
He's calling Afzal?

252
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,736
He's calling him.

253
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,270
Go.

254
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,960
He's called you.

255
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,270
Not her; he's called Afzal.

256
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,200
Not her; he's called Afzal.
-She's Afzal.

257
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,620
She's Afzal in his absence.

258
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,697
She's my daughter.

259
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,450
Enough...

260
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,090
My hand is drenched with your tears...

261
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,120
What happened?

262
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,060
Nothing.

263
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,180
Just --

264
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,790
You scared us all.

265
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,220
Scared her too?

266
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,840
No.

267
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,080
Not her.

268
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,800
Kept saying,

269
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,200
'The Reverend's not hollow-hearted'.

270
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,650
She has her own way to reason...

271
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,530
Says anything...

272
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,440
And God smiles on hearing it...

273
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,810
Who's the one he was calling out to in his sleep?

274
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,920
In my sleep?

275
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,090
Who was I calling out to?

276
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,730
Afzal. You mentioned a certain Afzal.

277
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,310
Asleep or unconscious?

278
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,056
I cannot make such a mistake in my sleep...

279
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:27,316
But then there's no power but God's...

280
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,470
Where's --?

281
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,340
He's not come, Dad.

282
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,200
He doesn't even know.

283
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,340
I'm not talking about him --

284
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,426
I was asking about your mother.

285
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:46,640
Please, let her come too...

286
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,010
And don't tell her

287
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,540
I called out to 'Afzal' in my sleep...

288
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,150
Her heart's a bit frail...

289
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,766
Sure, call her, but only for a short while.

290
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,760
Afzal is my son.

291
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,580
Rather unduteous...

292
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,260
Which is why I'm cross with him...

293
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,970
Yes sir

294
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,720
He's entered Hyderabad.

295
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,990
No sir,

296
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,470
Three cars.

297
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,260
The third one has his guards.

298
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,887
Don't worry, sir!

299
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:53,750
Reverend...

300
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,637
Guess who's here.

301
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,711
Miss Coconut Biscuits is at your feet.

302
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,240
Gotten engaged?

303
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Did you hear that?

304
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,900
The first question.

305
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,370
Satisfy him.

306
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,720
Tell him she's not gotten engaged.

307
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,370
The engagement can wait.

308
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,507
Get well soon and come home. Then, we'll fix the date.

309
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,000
There now.

310
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,746
Look at his happiness.

311
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,760
He's saying he's not happy.

312
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,436
Would've been better if she'd gotten engaged.

313
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,490
Look -

314
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,711
The groom's here too.

315
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,810
He's been here all the time.

316
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,560
Ready as if

317
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,010
He'd go forth with the wedding on this very day.

318
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,490
What do you know, son,

319
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,450
He's one who'd not let his son get engaged.

320
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,770
Who are you?

321
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,790
He's the one who'll put the ring on me.

322
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm adamant over this.

323
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,740
You're clashing with God's man.

324
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,230
You'll pay for it later.

325
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,610
What are you saying, Ruqaiyya?

326
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,436
Look at the gloom on her face...

327
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,000
We know whom we're clashing with.

328
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,596
We'll pay for it if we have to, but make no complaints.

329
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:46,670
Excuse me for a while; I'll drop them home.

330
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,810
No -- no,

331
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,140
There's no need to come...

332
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,830
I'm fine now...

333
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,700
I'll come for my rightful reward.

334
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,600
At this age, one has to struggle to win it.

335
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,341
Come, my dear.

336
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,100
I'll bring you breakfast tomorrow.

337
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,600
Good be with ye.

338
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm leaving Sibtain here.

339
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,701
Why are you troubling me, my good man?

340
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,330
Sorry, son...

341
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,670
You're trapped here for nothing.

342
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,980
Not at all, Uncle Reverend,

343
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,400
No one's trapped me.

344
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,436
I told Dad I'd stay here.

345
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,360
Alright, goodbye.

346
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,897
Goodbye.

347
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,780
Did you see, Ruqaiyya?

348
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,070
The world owes a lot to people like them.

349
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:59,427
Else the horn [of Doomsday] would long have been blown...

350
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,830
Peace be upon you.

351
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,790
Is Dad alright?

352
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,706
Yes, he's alright.

353
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,907
Got engaged?

354
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,256
Next time, we won't invite Uncle Reverend to my engagement.

355
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:52,700
Jasmine?

356
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,426
She's so sweet!

357
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,126
Where's Dad?

358
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,567
Upstairs in a room.

359
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:08,667
Wait, Afzal.

360
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,300
He's just regained consciousness.

361
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,320
He called out to you as he was unconscious.

362
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,850
As he came to,

363
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,856
He got angry at the mention of your name.

364
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,496
Take it slowly.

365
00:36:31,496 --> 00:36:33,610
Meet Mum first,

366
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,502
And ask her to let you meet Dad.

367
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,130
He'd left at odds with Dad's orders.

368
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:50,926
It's as if he'd broken him...

369
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,850
Now --

370
00:36:55,850 --> 00:37:00,380
Making amends will take ten or so minutes...

371
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,090
But don't worry.

372
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:09,036
He'll meet you the moment he comes to know.

373
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,220
I'll call Mum.

374
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,530
Afzal's here?

375
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,530
