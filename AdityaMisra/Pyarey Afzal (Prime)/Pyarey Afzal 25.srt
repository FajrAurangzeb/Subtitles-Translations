1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,860
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,206
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:30,640
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,120
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,620
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,273
What's his name?

8
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:52,034
Babu Hamid.

9
00:01:52,254 --> 00:01:54,604
Who shot him?

10
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,610
Wali and his hoodlums.

11
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,430
You'd come here before, right?

12
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,056
With another wounded

13
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,517
Who'd been shot in the leg?

14
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:02,568
Yes.

15
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:04,303
Who are the two of them to you?

16
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:05,997
They're our tenants.

17
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,468
Wali had shot him, too?
-Yes.

18
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,698
There!

19
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:12,390
That's what happens when you don't file a complaint.

20
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,291
Is there any guardian or relative with him?

21
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,602
There's the two of us.

22
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,062
You're the landlady.

23
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:19,232
What about his family?

24
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,892
He has no family.

25
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,027
There!

26
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,918
He's here, too.

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,991
Peace be upon you, Uncle.

28
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,861
And upon you, peace.

29
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:30,831
My dear,

30
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,632
How is he now?

31
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:34,012
No idea.

32
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,875
They've taken him to the operation theatre,

33
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:39,186
But they're not telling me anything.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,197
This is Afzal's landlady,

35
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,586
And this is her daughter, Jasmine.

36
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,167
Peace be upon you.

37
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,362
And upon you, peace.

38
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,420
Is his condition rather serious?

39
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,306
He's taken a lot of bullets.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,006
How are you?

41
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,766
I'll be walking by tomorrow.

42
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,776
I've checked,

43
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,877
I have no difficulty walking.

44
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,980
Is any of you a relative of Babu Hamid's?

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,460
Under whose name would the complaint be filed?

46
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,401
We'll talk after the operation's been done.

47
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:29,052
May we talk about us for now?

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,369
Babu Hamid had come to save me.

49
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,556
Do you know why he was crying buckets?

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,260
For his friend.

51
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,486
No.

52
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,376
For Jasmine.

53
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:18,861
He'd be cursing his friend.

54
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:23,464
If he hadn't taken bullets at that very moment, the two of <i>them</i> would've met today, for sure!

55
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,392
Met?

56
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,692
Well, they couldn't <i>really</i> have met...

57
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,123
We'd dropped in, too.

58
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:32,253
Please, Farah,

59
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,130
His friend's stuck between life and death,

60
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,406
He can't move without a wheelchair,

61
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:39,481
And you think he'd think of a date at such a moment?

62
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:42,601
Then, you haven't seen how <i>he</i>'s stuck!

63
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:45,320
Between Jasmine on one side, and you on the other.

64
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,606
Me?

65
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,957
You're here, too, aren't you?

66
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,617
Jasmine would've called before coming,

67
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,327
And you've come without.

68
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:55,383
He's just hiding his face from you.

69
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:58,138
Even Karachi's water can't have its effect...

70
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:01,069
You're here in the same condition you'd left in.

71
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,610
You're here now, aren't you? You should relish Karachi's water.

72
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,970
If the Lord wills, it'll kill you off where there'll not be a drop of relief.

73
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,341
Why are we standing here?

74
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,251
We could go where the struggle's going on.

75
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:14,831
Come.

76
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,287
If there's a man with you, please call him.

77
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:26,058
Yes?

78
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:26,969
Tell me.

79
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,949
Four bullets had struck him,

80
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,140
Three in the stomach,

81
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,660
And one right here by the heart.

82
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,530
The one that struck the heart was very dangerous.

83
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,959
He's --

84
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,646
Alright, isn't he?

85
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:43,687
No.

86
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:46,328
We couldn't save him.

87
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,007
Look what we have here!

88
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,427
My heart knew

89
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:14,418
There'd be such a scene going on here.

90
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,710
He's dead, Farah,

91
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,010
That's why this 'scene' is going on.

92
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,081
His wounds were bleeding again today.

93
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,010
The poor man.

94
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,287
He's gotten himself mired in so many troubles ever since he came here.

95
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,628
If he came here with his parents' curses,

96
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:11,188
This was bound to happen.

97
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,578
Shut up, Farah!

98
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,280
Parents don't curse.

99
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,716
Maybe not a curse,

100
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:19,332
But their wails do work.

101
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:22,796
I've seen his parents torment for him.

102
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:24,597
They even feared

103
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:27,026
That he may bolt his room from the inside in his anger.

104
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,417
Someone's died, Farah!

105
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,964
Someone's lost his life.

106
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,925
Don't you feel any sorrow over it?

107
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,247
This has all happened because of him, innit?

108
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,968
I heard everything at the mourning.

109
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,418
The poor man

110
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,418
Had gone

111
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,648
To save Afzal's beloved from the killer.

112
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,778
And do you know why this had come to be?

113
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,058
Because Afzal

114
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,538
Had beaten Jasmine's cousin before everyone!

115
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:50,688
Cousin, as in,

116
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,293
The killer.

117
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,920
I've heard everything about him, too.

118
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,846
He's the neighbourhood's ace hooligan

119
00:08:58,846 --> 00:08:59,747
In fact,

120
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,010
He's got a handful of neighbourhoods under him.

121
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,841
Shut up, Farah.

122
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,406
I'd been quiet for three hours there, hadn't I?

123
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:08,697
I've seen every scene put up by everyone.

124
00:09:08,697 --> 00:09:09,647
Remember

125
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,960
How that Jasmine was getting dizzy?

126
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,316
Would you look at that!

127
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,952
No bond or tie whatsoever -

128
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:17,360
Does one weep like that

129
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,267
For <i>just</i> a tenant?

130
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,568
I understand such weeping very well.

131
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:25,154
She was looking for Afzal's shoulder to cry on.

132
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,077
She'd be thinking

133
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:29,927
Of Afzal's shoulder to cry on as an excuse to wrap herself around him.

134
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,918
You're raving mad.

135
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:33,908
Who knows what you're talking of!

136
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,400
Did I say anything wrong?

137
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,316
If you didn't, tell me,

138
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,670
What's our relation with Afzal?

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,610
Why had your Dad come looking for him?

140
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,276
And why have we come to take him back?

141
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,867
You'll find out when you've seen the world

142
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,997
That you won't find compassion in ties of blood,

143
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:54,968
And you'll find passions driven by bloodlust.

144
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,110
I, too, have come with someone's sorrow as a weight on my heart,

145
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,990
Because I feel that when a mother torments over separation from her son,

146
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,851
It falls on all mothers to torment in her pain.

147
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,870
Tormenting in someone's pain, too, is a kind of a tie, Farah.

148
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:22,741
If I'm tormented out of this tie, that girl must be, too.

149
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,652
Try and get this across to her,

150
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:33,071
Or tell her to go to sleep.

151
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,097
What would you get it across to me?

152
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,878
I'm doing all of this for you!

153
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:41,461
Otherwise, she may wrap herself around Afzal

154
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,102
Otherwise, she may wrap herself around Afzal for all I care!

155
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,416
Come.

156
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,106
Sir, this...

157
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,307
This is our house in Karachi.

158
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:07,348
Now,

159
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:10,649
You're staying here until your wound's healed.

160
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,719
I've talked to the doctors; one of them will check you regularly here.

161
00:11:15,719 --> 00:11:20,381
But, sir --
-You've done a lot as you wanted to.

162
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:24,910
Even if you've not made any mistake, it feels as if you have.

163
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,850
So, it's not proper that you reply to me with 'but',

164
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,500
Or want

165
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,100
That you be left to yourself in this condition.

166
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,580
Stay here a few days,

167
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,341
And you may go wherever you please once you get better.

168
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,452
Come with me.

169
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,222
Carefully now. Good.

170
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,507
Room #9.

171
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:58,476
Yes.

172
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:00,126
Right.

173
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,642
What?

174
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,687
When?

175
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,556
Alright, thanks.

176
00:12:09,556 --> 00:12:11,267
Thank you.

177
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,626
Here.

178
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:17,609
Have something.

179
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,162
How could I have anything, Mam?

180
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:24,637
He's left, too.

181
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,647
Who?

182
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,528
Afzal...

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,273
But this was bound to happen.

184
00:12:34,273 --> 00:12:36,961
The day she'd come here, looking for him,

185
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,662
Was the day my heart had told me,

186
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:42,623
'It's time for Afzal [to leave]'.

187
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,030
He's not at the hospital?

188
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,630
No.

189
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,471
He's left the room.

190
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,838
And those who'd come from Hyderabad, looking for him,

191
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:57,258
Have taken him along to Hyderabad.

192
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,876
Surely, he wasn't so uncultured?

193
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:02,967
He's stayed here for three months.

194
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,726
He'd have some shame about our dealings.

195
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:08,517
Plus, he's a Reverend's son,

196
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:11,878
Surely, he can't be so treacherous!

197
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,390
He'd come here someday to account for his shame.

198
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,846
He'd bring her along.

199
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,480
He'd say,

200
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,747
'She's my wife'.

201
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,270
But she said she was nobody to him?

202
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,991
That's how I'd reasoned it out with you.

203
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,391
Remember what you'd told me?

204
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,347
Take the dinner away.

205
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,459
I'll start eating tomorrow.

206
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,939
In sorrow, one would rather stay hungry just as a formality, if nothing else...

207
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,930
So he doesn't have a phone with him even now?

208
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,333
That's where he'd been clever!

209
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,284
He neither kept a phone, nor gave me a number.

210
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,750
The blighter would've thought from the outset,

211
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,638
'I'd fly away and disappear the moment I feel like'.

212
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,394
Just think that he was a talking parrot.

213
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,963
Enjoyed his treats for a few days,

214
00:14:15,963 --> 00:14:18,594
Indulged us,

215
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:22,645
And, having engrossed us in his words, flew away.

216
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,856
Good night, Mam.

217
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,116
Hey!

218
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,746
You're here, sleeping!

219
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:51,200
Do you even know who's come here?

220
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,816
Who?

221
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,077
It'll rouse you proper if you heard it.

222
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:59,407
You'd sit before the mirror, setting your hair right.

223
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,166
Oh...

224
00:15:01,343 --> 00:15:03,984
He's staying here tonight.

225
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:06,698
Who?

226
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:07,909
The same

227
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,210
Who's a watermelon and red on the inside.

228
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,781
Watermelon?

229
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,741
Yes.

230
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:14,920
Dad says,

231
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,491
'To find a gentleman from among men'

232
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:20,262
'Is like finding from a heap of watermelons one'

233
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,693
'That's bright red on the inside'.

234
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:23,590
The rapscallion!

235
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,960
He's cherry red, I give you that!
-Oh, shut up!

236
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,176
Who is it?

237
00:15:28,176 --> 00:15:31,246
Not now. I'll tell you in the morning. He's fallen asleep now.

238
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,467
I opened the door and had a look at him.

239
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,637
He's sleeping peacefully.

240
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,130
Get

241
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,037
Get out!

242
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:40,460
What?

243
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,257
I said get lost!

244
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,592
I'm in no mood for a load of guff.

245
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:46,052
I couldn't sleep,

246
00:15:46,052 --> 00:15:48,870
So I thought I'd come here and talk to you.

247
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,486
But you're not a good choice.

248
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,162
Now, I'll go and wake him up,

249
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:55,367
And talk about everything with him.

250
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,146
Halt.

251
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,346
Tell me,

252
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,757
Who is it?

253
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,798
Afzal.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,517
<i>Here</i>?

255
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:14,378
Not <i>here</i>, over <i>there</i>.

256
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,879
In the guests' room below.

257
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,129
Who brought him here?

258
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,520
Dad.

259
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,136
Hey!

260
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,151
The poor man,

261
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:23,591
He was griefstricken over his friend.

262
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:24,590
Dad thought

263
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,500
He'd be looked after here,

264
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,027
And comforted, too, if necessary.

265
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,490
Congratulations.

266
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,751
Thank you.

267
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,012
Congratulations to you, too.

268
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:36,890
He's

269
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,790
Just limping a little.

270
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,099
Pray that he gets better.

271
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:42,416
Go.

272
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,216
I've prayed.

273
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:47,723
Know what, Dad said he'd take him to Hyderabad when he gets better.

274
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:48,591
Just see,

275
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,330
I won't let him go away from there, then!

276
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,647
You?

277
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,367
Yes.

278
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,937
He's begun obeying everything I say.

279
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,770
I said,

280
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,590
'Take your medicines',

281
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,880
And he took them instantly.

282
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,180
I said, 'Have your soup',

283
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,717
And he had his soup instantly.

284
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:10,328
And when I said 'Go to sleep',
-He fell asleep instantly?

285
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,723
Obviously.

286
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:13,698
Wait and watch. I'll go and wake him up,

287
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,359
He'd get up in a moment.

288
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,926
Go, then,

289
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:19,716
And wake him up.

290
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:21,796
One day, he'd wake you up,

291
00:17:21,796 --> 00:17:23,816
And you'd come to me, crying, saying,

292
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:24,836
'Oh, Farah',

293
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,647
'How long it's taken me to wake up'!

294
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,947
Good night, Farah.

295
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,626
Are you awake?

296
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:42,936
Who is it?

297
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,376
It's me, Lubna.

298
00:17:45,376 --> 00:17:46,510
Yes...

299
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,380
I'm awake...

300
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,800
Awake, as in, I may come in, right?

301
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,726
Easy there, lie down.

302
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,020
Hey!

303
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,020
So you've got a cellphone, too?

304
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,556
No, it's

305
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:04,696
My friend's.

306
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:05,687
Oh...

307
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,130
The poor man.

308
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,106
Call Arifa when it's charged.

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,447
No.

310
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,680
I won't call them for a while.

311
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,269
I've sworn an oath.

312
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:20,542
Wouldn't you go to Hyderabad?
-I will, someday...

313
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,092
What 'someday'?

314
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:24,062
You're going one of these days.

315
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,953
We haven't come to Karachi on a tour.

316
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:27,934
We'd take you along.

317
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,644
I said I'm not going now.

318
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,995
Have you lost your heart to Jasmine?

319
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:38,405
Why do you lose your heart

320
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:42,106
To a new lass every few months?

321
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:44,386
What's your star?

322
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,616
Must be Leo.

323
00:18:46,616 --> 00:18:48,257
Don't worry, though.

324
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,038
If you still feel

325
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:52,139
That you love Jasmine after going back,

326
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:55,620
Come over to Karachi with a wedding procession.

327
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,480
Look,

328
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,211
Jasmine's a very good girl, but --
-If she's so good, why this 'but'?

329
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,932
Shoot away all your older love stories --

330
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,852
Speaking of shooting,

331
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:09,462
You've taken a bullet for her, too, haven't you?

332
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,000
What would you hide from me, now?

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,386
I know everything.

334
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:14,700
In fact, Farah does, too.

335
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,870
Actually, she's the one who'd told me.

336
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,280
Farah had seen it when she'd wrapped herself around you, weeping.

337
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,709
She said the moment she saw it,

338
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,692
'Would you look at their love'!

339
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,243
I'd seen some of it for myself, too.

340
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:28,310
She felt dizzy thrice at the mourning,

341
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,346
And she'd looked your way before she got dizzy all three times.

342
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,791
Please, Lubna,

343
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:37,152
My friend's death is no joke.

344
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,586
You're right there...

345
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:42,443
But the love of those who live is not joke either.

346
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:44,904
Fleeing Hyderabad like cowards,

347
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,994
Two-timing the Farah from the letters,

348
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,205
Attempting an engagement with our Farah,

349
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:53,696
And this affaire de cœur with Jasmine is no joke either.

350
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,587
Your Mum, Dad, and Arifa at home are tormented for you,

351
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:02,273
And you're stumbling around in your love for a new comely lassie?

352
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,571
By the Lord, I don't love Jasmine.

353
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,530
Right...

354
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,001
Whose turn is it this time?

355
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:16,803
It's <i>my</i> turn.

356
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,570
This time, I won't play a gambit

357
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,701
That I'd have to lose my heart to win.

358
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:28,584
I've come from Hyderabad, having learnt

359
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:32,485
That love matters to us,

360
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:36,655
But we don't matter to love.

361
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,257
Have you taken your medicines?

362
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,681
I have.

363
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,831
Go to sleep, now.

364
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,617
And refrain from talking about love

365
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:52,658
Until the end of your course of medicines.

366
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:54,400
Good night.

367
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,819
Listen,

368
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,550
Give me the phone.

369
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,380
Sure.

370
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,750
Good night.

371
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,741
It's <i>my</i> turn.

372
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:59,147
This time, I won't play a gambit

373
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:02,080
That I'd have to lose my heart to win.

374
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,287
I've come from Hyderabad, having learnt

375
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:09,249
That love matters to us,

376
00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:12,570
But we don't matter to love.

377
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,040
Done with your little chat?

378
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,921
Yes...

379
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,000
I finally asked about Jasmine today.

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,381
Doubting someone isn't good, so to speak,

381
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:26,921
But you'd gotten this doubt into my heart.

382
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:28,731
I thought I'd ask this

383
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,932
Now that I'm talking about so much.

384
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,492
And he'd have said,

385
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:33,450
'Not at all',

386
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,076
'It's nothing like that'.

387
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,090
No.

388
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,967
He didn't say that.

389
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:42,716
He said, 'By the Lord, I don't love Jasmine'.

390
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,601
That means

391
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:48,909
He doesn't love Jasmine.

392
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,586
Good night.

393
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,976
Jasmine!

394
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,006
Get up, Jasmine!

395
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,970
Your phone's ringing.

396
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,970
Get up and see

397
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,796
Who it is.

398
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,900
Babu Hamid?

399
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,720
Don't worry, it'd be him.

400
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,376
Afzal.

401
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,176
Hello?

402
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,396
It's Afzal here.

403
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:41,317
Hey!

404
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:43,787
I thought you'd run away.

405
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,770
Where would I run away to, now?

406
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,633
I'll be back any of these days.

407
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,867
You'd stay here, won't you?

408
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:52,320
I don't know where I'd stay.

409
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,286
But I'd stay in Karachi.

410
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:04,368
Should I get you something to eat, now?

411
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:06,502
Yes.

412
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,680
No, Uncle Ibrahim, they wouldn't have fallen asleep at all!

413
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,830
The two of them stay awake all night.

414
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,226
Dad!

415
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,736
Dad!
-Yes?

416
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,831
Uncle Ibrahim's calling.
-Oh?

417
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:21,490
Begin in the Lord's name! [Auspicious beginning]

418
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:24,661
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur!

419
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,316
And upon you, peace.

420
00:24:26,316 --> 00:24:29,154
I hope I've not woken you up?

421
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:31,065
No, Monseigneur,

422
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:34,714
We've been sleeping for five days, hopeful

423
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:37,585
That if the Lord wills thus, you would call,

424
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:40,975
And we'd wake up at the sound of your voice.

425
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,255
Please, wake us up today.

426
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,028
We can't

427
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:47,110
Pretend to sleep anymore.

428
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,341
I've found him.

429
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,011
Praise the Lord!

430
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,796
Monseigneur's found him!

431
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,191
M --

432
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:04,420
May the Lord give you your due reward for this noble deed, Monseigneur!

433
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,920
May the Lord always keep you happy, Monseigneur!

434
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,431
Where's the rapscallion?
-He's here, with me.

435
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:13,030
I've brought him to my place.

436
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,960
I've brought him to my place.
-Alright.

437
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,296
He'd be nearby, listening?

438
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:21,650
No, he doesn't even know I'm talking to you.

439
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,147
Oh?

440
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,506
Get to Karachi tomorrow,

441
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:27,337
And bring Madame along.

442
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:28,370
Just

443
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,670
Disconnect the call, we're leaving right now.

444
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,210
No, not right now.

445
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,930
Get here tomorrow evening.

446
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:40,251
Lubna's just told me that he's not ready to go to Hyderabad,

447
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:44,751
And I don't want that he should suspect you're coming either.

448
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,872
Does he not miss even his mother?

449
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:50,402
He says, 'I' --

450
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:52,970
'Won't go back to Hyderabad'.

451
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,717
No,

452
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:57,458
Let me talk.
-Jus -- Just a minute, Ruqaiyya.

453
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,139
His face --

454
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,546
His appearance is the same, innit?

455
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:06,629
Don't worry, he's the same.

456
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:10,997
He isn't the same at all, Monseigneur.

457
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:15,077
The blighter's heart has changed...

458
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,231
Is he sleeping?

459
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:19,862
Yes.

460
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,346
Your Afzal is sleeping.

461
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:26,132
Didn't I tell you, Ruqaiyya,

462
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:29,292
That we're not dear

463
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:32,791
To our dear son?

464
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,441
Thank you so much, Monseigneur.

465
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,440
Please give your address

466
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,131
To Arifa.

467
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:49,392
There's no need to give any address.

468
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:51,844
My driver would be there tomorrow evening,

469
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,845
Just get in the car with him and come here.

470
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,856
What's the need, Monseigneur?

471
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,406
It's absolutely needed, Reverend.

472
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:01,596
Please, don't refuse.

473
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:03,750
As you command.

474
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,027
God be with ye.

475
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:07,540
May God watch over you.

476
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,710
What does he say?

477
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,309
He says, 'I'll send a car; just get in and come here'.

478
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:16,590
And he says he's not coming to Hyderabad?

479
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,731
Let him say if he wants to!

480
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:22,007
I'd plead with him

481
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,543
With folded hands,

482
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:26,724
I'd take off my turban and place it in his feet,

483
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:30,294
What could he say, then?

484
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,834
We're

485
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:44,350
Parents, Ruqaiyya,

486
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:48,076
It's on us to keep trying everything.

487
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:51,116
And she's going along, too!

488
00:27:51,116 --> 00:27:52,827
She'd even

489
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,326
Grab the unduteous lad

490
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:56,987
By his collar!

491
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,858
He'd come if you call him.

492
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:21,837
Otherwise, he'd stay in hiding.

493
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:24,480
What'd you do if he came?

494
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,126
What's left to be done?

495
00:28:27,616 --> 00:28:30,310
I'd finish this trivial rivalry.

496
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,350
He'd think we want to hand him over to the police.

497
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,647
He won't think that.

498
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,657
He knows that no complaint was filed against him.

499
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:43,088
He'd think you're afraid of him.

500
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,523
He'd seize and take away a scared Jasmine.

501
00:28:46,523 --> 00:28:50,440
That'd happen only when he'd think that I'm afraid of him.

502
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,453
That's what he'd say if you talk about ending this rivalry.

503
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:54,839
He'd say, 'Give me Jasmine',

504
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,633
'And our rivalry ends'.

505
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:59,926
I've given him Babu Hamid's corpse.

506
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:02,240
I'll say, 'That's enough'.

507
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,096
You don't know him, Afzal.

508
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:07,687
He doesn't know me either, Jasmine.

509
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,763
Just call him once,

510
00:29:10,763 --> 00:29:13,390
But don't tell him that I'll be there to meet him, too.

511
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,566
Then I'd say whatever comes to mind.

512
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,230
Sure.

513
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,446
Say whatever comes to your mind.

514
00:29:22,146 --> 00:29:24,000
Alright, I'll disconnect.

515
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,959
I'd await your call.

516
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,026
What is it, Jasmine?

517
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,090
Afzal's afraid of Wali, Mam.

518
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,486
What is this, Arifa?

519
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:11,027
It's Mum's things and clothes, Dad.

520
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:12,866
I'm locking the door.

521
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:13,940
Hold on,

522
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,897
Wait, Ruqaiyya.

523
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:19,298
Why are you taking such a large suitcase?

524
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:22,858
How many days would you stay there?
-As many as it takes.

525
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:23,860
Remember

526
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,800
What Monseigneur had said.

527
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,400
He's not agreeing to come back just yet.

528
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,914
So?

529
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:35,077
So, Reverend, as long as he stays in Karachi, so will I.

530
00:30:35,077 --> 00:30:37,832
I'm going along, am I not?

531
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:40,881
Which means on this very day

532
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,936
I'll bring him back.

533
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,450
Leave it be, Reverend.

534
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,540
Our faith does not permit making such claims,

535
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,297
So, get in the car quietly,

536
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:58,770
And keep praying until we get to Karachi that he agrees to come back.

537
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,127
If he does, alright.

538
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,897
Otherwise, how far is Karachi?

539
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:06,998
You can come and meet the two of us whenever you please.

540
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,837
Come here,

541
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,836
My good man.

542
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:18,188
This --

543
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:21,097
Put this suitcase in the bag.

544
00:31:21,097 --> 00:31:23,070
A son's adamance

545
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:26,737
Is heavier than any suitcase, Reverend.

546
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,300
Leave it be, good chap.

547
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,360
I'll carry it myself.

548
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:45,570
God sufficeth me. There is no God save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous Throne. [Prayer for strength in times of hardship]

549
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,366
God is the Greatest!

550
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,437
On the phone again?

551
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:10,958
Lad's the odd sort.

552
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,468
Hello?

553
00:32:12,468 --> 00:32:14,801
It's Afzal.

554
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,267
Afzal, you bugger!

555
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,957
It's Afzal! Afzal!

556
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,181
Where were you, you blighter?

557
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:25,901
And why was your phone switched off?

558
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,060
Do you even know

559
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,390
That those who love you weep when the remember you, mate?

560
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,157
I weep when I remember them, too, mate.

561
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:37,896
But stop crying now.

562
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,107
Bring everyone over here to me.

563
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:41,767
Where?

564
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,616
Karachi.

565
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:47,837
Tell them they'd get a job,

566
00:32:47,837 --> 00:32:50,682
And a salary like their stakes.

567
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:53,326
Who'd give such a job?

568
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:55,456
I would.

569
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:56,251
Right,

570
00:32:56,251 --> 00:32:58,442
And what's the job?

571
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:01,982
You'd have to sacrifice your life for me.

572
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,774
He says, 'You'd have to sacrifice your life for me'.
-Oh?

573
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,285
What happened, bugger?

574
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:09,685
Scared?

575
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:10,661
No --

576
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:11,931
I was just thinking

577
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:16,151
That one'd have to get a good salary if one has to sacrifice his life.

578
00:33:16,151 --> 00:33:17,382
What do you say?

579
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:21,820
Your appointment letter's ready.
-Just take it! Take it!

580
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,570
Alright.

581
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,981
When do we join?

582
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:27,972
Today.

583
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,306
Right now.

584
00:33:30,306 --> 00:33:32,519
Just a minute.

585
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,740
What happened?

586
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
What is it?

587
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,180
Your family was going

588
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,186
In Monseigneur Ibrahim's car.

589
00:33:47,186 --> 00:33:48,487
Monseigneur, you know?

590
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:49,590
The mill owner?

591
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,241
With him.

592
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,581
Alright, disconnect the call,

593
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,332
And get here before the evening.

594
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,332
Alright,

595
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:58,340
We'll be there.

596
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,116
Okay.
-'We'll be there'?

597
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,922
Come in, Monsieur le Docteur.

598
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:08,417
So, how are you?

599
00:34:08,862 --> 00:34:10,030
Now,

600
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,490
I've started walking.

601
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,620
I'd run away by the evening.

602
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,121
I mean, I'd be running by the evening.
-Don't even think about it.

603
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,937
Running isn't good for you.

604
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,576
You've come to collect the rent, haven't you?

605
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:30,846
You're saying as if you've got the money in your pocket!

606
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:31,576
Exactly.

607
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,304
I've got it in my pocket since the morning.

608
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:34,934
Hold this, will you?

609
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,440
Right here.

610
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,590
I hope it doesn't hurt?

611
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,816
Not much.

612
00:35:57,816 --> 00:35:59,096
Okay.

613
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:00,857
Here.

614
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:03,923
You can run after two days.

615
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:05,417
Nothing to worry.

616
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,773
You're taking your medicines, aren't you?

617
00:36:07,773 --> 00:36:08,827
Yes.

618
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,527
Have your medicines on time for a few more days.

619
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:12,968
Sure.

620
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:13,968
Alright,

621
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:14,668
See you.

622
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:17,892
Alright, thank you so much.
-Thank you.

623
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,956
Listen...

624
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:25,381
Did you

625
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:27,247
Talk to Arifa?

626
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:28,267
No?

627
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,586
Not at all.

628
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,926
Surely,

629
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,129
You must be talking now and then?

630
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:36,270
Yes, I do, sometimes...

631
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,606
How are Mum and Dad?

632
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:39,306
Only they'd know that...

633
00:36:39,306 --> 00:36:41,107
I've heard that when sons run away from their homes,

634
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:42,907
One only looks at his Mum and Dad's faces,

635
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:46,377
One doesn't ask, 'How are you'?

636
00:36:48,742 --> 00:36:50,680
Anything else?

637
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,627
No.

638
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,061
Thank you.

639
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,016
May I ask something, now?

640
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:56,991
Yes?

641
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:58,896
Why do you have this penchant for running?

642
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,012
And if you ran away,

643
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:01,181
Where'd you go?

644
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:03,062
To Jasmine?

645
00:37:04,082 --> 00:37:06,143
In that case, give me her number.

646
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,513
I'll call her here.

647
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,630
And if you have any shame left,

648
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,240
Don't run away from here.

649
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,566
I understand what you mean very well,

650
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,790
But you'd better understand this nice and clear, too,

651
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,911
The hearts of those who hold you dear stop beating when you run away.

652
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,556
Alright,

653
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:42,420
If you marry me, what'd you do to the one sitting at home?

654
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,297
Tell me what I should do.

655
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,497
It's obvious.

656
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,697
Two swords can't share the same sheath.

657
00:37:48,697 --> 00:37:51,733
Oh, she ain't no sword!

658
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,243
You're the sword.

659
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,294
Your very gaze slits throats!

660
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:56,740
Whatever.

661
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,107
Say it again.

662
00:37:58,107 --> 00:37:59,086
What?

663
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,047
The same.

664
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,187
'Whatever'.

665
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:02,588
You say it so well.

666
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:04,228
Don't get me busy talking.

667
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:07,180
Send her away if you want to marry me.

668
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,310
I can call her right now if you say.

669
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,526
She'd be gone before the evening.

670
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:13,317
Get here before the evening.

671
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:14,990
Talk to Mam.

672
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,330
If Mam asks for 500,000 in Mahr [bride price], just say, 'Alright'.

673
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,986
Don't get all worked up to hear about 500,000. I'm not taking any from you.

674
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:26,447
Have I turned you down, Jasmine?

675
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:29,488
Forget 500,000, I'd give 1 million.

676
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:32,810
And if you want, you can have my head along with it.

677
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,661
Say auspicious things.

678
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,231
Auspicious?

679
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,142
As in,

680
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,144
At least don't talk about having your head.

681
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:43,730
My late Mam used to say, 'When a girl thinks of someone as her husband',

682
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,570
'One could just as well sacrifice his life for her'.

683
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,130
Just tell me, is it fear or love?

684
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,477
I've fallen in love.

685
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,071
You're lying, sweet wifey.

686
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,832
It is fear, for now.

687
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:06,453
You'd only fall in love later.

688
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,301
Go and face them,

689
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:26,541
And tell them you're prepared to die.

690
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:29,270
I'm not ready to die just yet.

691
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,406
I'm not afraid of dying,

692
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:34,686
But I want to live on.

693
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
