1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,860
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,145
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:24,240
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,720
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,219
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,220
Sitting here like this,

8
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,740
Staring at the roof and the walls,

9
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,098
Tell me,

10
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:17,960
Are you on the verge of a new discovery,

11
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,860
Or are you intent on destroying everything?

12
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,540
Sit tight.

13
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,021
Put it down before her.

14
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,951
What's this?

15
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:38,120
This is your gown for the engagement,

16
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,868
And here's the diamond ring they'll put on you the day after tomorrow.

17
00:02:41,868 --> 00:02:44,169
The day after tomorrow?

18
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,810
Don't argue over the day after tomorrow.

19
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,920
Just think it's the date of an exam -

20
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,970
Once it's been fixed, it's been fixed.

21
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,542
Why are you looking at Mum?

22
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:57,845
Look at the ring.

23
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,934
Isn't it lovely?

24
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,611
At least you could've asked me once before fixing the date.

25
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,170
Are you talking to Lubna, or me?

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,340
To you, of course, Mum.

27
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,460
Then you're a right daring lass.

28
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,800
Just because I've come to show you the gown and the ring,

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Don't think I'm asking you,

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,161
'Do you like the gown'?

31
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,421
'Do you like the ring'?

32
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:26,241
It's just that Sibtain's father wished that it be shown to you;

33
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,760
The gown is from him, too.

34
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,448
Come.

35
00:03:29,448 --> 00:03:30,800
We're done here, Lubna.

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,509
Just take it that she likes it.

37
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,650
If the engagement's on the day after tomorrow,

38
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,751
If the engagement's on the day after tomorrow, tell them it won't be.

39
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,420
Tell whom?

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,480
Sibtain's father?

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,470
Tell him that daughters here order their parents around?

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,970
Hold your horses, you barmy lass,

43
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,064
Or every slap I've held back all my life will grace your face now.

44
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,760
Come.

45
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:05,490
At least ask me, Mum,

46
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,435
Why not the day after tomorrow?

47
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,710
Right, what is it the day after tomorrow?

48
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,980
Won't you invite Afzal's Mum?

49
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,450
I'm going to her once I'm through with you.

50
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,160
How wicked, Mum!

51
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,971
She's laid up,

52
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,220
And you'd invite her to the engagement?

53
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,359
It'll be enough if the Reverend is in attendance.

54
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,935
Although I'll ask him

55
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,185
To bring Arifa along too.

56
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,706
How could she come?

57
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:33,257
She's not going to leave her sick mother -- all alone...

58
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:36,630
Why are you suddenly feeling for her sick mother now?

59
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,710
First, you slandered her son and ousted him from Hyderabad,

60
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,234
And because of you, he became a hoodlum over there,

61
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,730
And that is what has made her fall ill,

62
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,233
And you're sitting here, playing her nurse?

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,550
His Mum's blimming 'Mother Teresa'!

64
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,751
Don't you dare ruin the engagement on the pretext of his mother!

65
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,750
The worst is already past.

66
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,740
Your intensive care isn't going to heal her.

67
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,035
Come.

68
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:03,419
Mum!

69
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,450
I don't like this ring, full stop!

70
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,490
Splendid.

71
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,570
You don't like a ring that costs 170,000?

72
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,490
What would you like?

73
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,932
Tell them, will you,

74
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:16,759
That I'll get the ring I like.

75
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,550
It won't be too expensive.

76
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,550
If I agree to this demand,

77
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,680
You won't create a scene on the day of the engagement, will you?

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,100
I swear by you, I won't. Not at all.

79
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,569
I'd even agree to the date.

80
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,490
Alright, then,

81
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,955
Get the ring you like.

82
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,180
May I ask about a problem, Reverend?

83
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,691
Begin in the Lord's name.

84
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,951
You've pronounced it forbidden

85
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:41,787
To meet him and be in his company,

86
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:45,478
But is it forbidden to look at him from afar, too?

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,989
I've gotten my answer.

88
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,470
How come you've gotten the answer

89
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,499
When I don't have one either?

90
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,910
Perhaps it's not forbidden,

91
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,730
But remember, Ruqaiyya Begum,

92
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,910
One look at him

93
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,928
Would forbid any calm from setting in in your life.

94
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:31,931
Then, this illusion of seeing the doctor,

95
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,672
These excuses of medicines,

96
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:38,127
None of this would work, either.

97
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:43,270
But I'm only talking about looking at him from afar, Reverend!

98
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,400
Just like --

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,810
I look at his photograph.

100
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,520
Does that torment me?

101
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,111
Why are you laughing?

102
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,280
I used to think

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,499
Who the blighter's taken after!

104
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,830
I've realised today

105
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,060
That he's taken after you.

106
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,483
Do you remember,

107
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,810
How he'd said one day,

108
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,299
'I've started down God's path, Dad'.

109
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,810
Would you see, now,

110
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,910
Where the path of God lies,

111
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,332
And where the wretch is!

112
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:35,150
And it's the same with you -

113
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,640
I check your pulse,

114
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,140
Give you medicines,

115
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,370
Give you courage,

116
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,061
So you can walk down the path of Reverend Subhanallah's wife.

117
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,619
But the moment you get a chance,

118
00:08:51,619 --> 00:08:55,610
You start treading down the mother's path!

119
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:04,170
Don't let a single teardrop fall, Ruqaiyya Begum,

120
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,299
Or I'll leave you with him.

121
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,000
Why don't you get her married, Aunt?

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,031
She won't get married now.

123
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,667
She's started teaching the kids.

124
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,920
So, what's with teaching the kids?

125
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,460
She's devoted herself to it.

126
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,351
She says, 'Once you've devoted yourself to something',

127
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,522
'You remain steadfast in your devotion'.

128
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,600
'You remain steadfast in your devotion'.
-Wrong answer, Aunt.

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,919
I mean --

130
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,189
What kind of a reply is this?

131
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,911
Wrong question, too, innit?

132
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:11,112
I mean, who are you to ask this?

133
00:10:11,112 --> 00:10:15,146
Have I ever said that you should get married? Or has Mam?

134
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,070
Don't look at my face,

135
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,570
Enjoy your food, and think that teaching the kids

136
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,830
Is a greater challenge than getting married, and I always choose the bigger challenge.

137
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,070
Is teaching children a job to you?

138
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,545
Put a sock in it!

139
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,100
Even a husband like Salim wouldn't pester one as much as the kids do!

140
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,590
One's got a finger in his nose, another's got an itch in his underarm.

141
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,337
And when I asked one to recite his lesson, it turned out he was sleeping!

142
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,710
And one lad's a proper royal - He asks, 'Miss',

143
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,990
'Why does 9 + 9 equal 18? Why not 19?'

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,400
Pray tell,

145
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,030
Why not 19?

146
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,780
You tell me that.

147
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,691
I just know it's 18.

148
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,656
Arifa, my dear, would you see who's there?

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,260
Peace be upon you, Uncle Reverend.

150
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,635
And upon you, peace, my dear.

151
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,101
What are you doing?

152
00:11:25,881 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm preparing a medicine

153
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,710
To strengthen the heart.

154
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,390
I'd take it with some honey,

155
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,720
And give some to her, too.

156
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,891
Peace be upon you!

157
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,761
Hey!

158
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,302
And upon you, peace.

159
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:09,500
It seems you'd not rest before I'm alright.

160
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,621
You're here everyday.

161
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,725
Sit.
-Alright.

162
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,980
Is that grinding noise coming from somewhere in our home?

163
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,436
Yes.

164
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,230
Uncle Reverend's preparing a medicine to strengthen the heart.

165
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,692
He'd give you some today!

166
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,280
That's what I feared.

167
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,090
He'd turn into a medic if he gave up his priesthood.

168
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,950
He'd given me an elixir after our marriage.

169
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,050
I used to have headaches in half my head.

170
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,430
I never had another ache in <i>just</i> half my head.

171
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,470
Are you waiting for my orders to get tea?

172
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,280
I won't have any tea.

173
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,871
I've not even come to look after you today.

174
00:12:57,871 --> 00:13:00,610
I'd like to ask for a favour.

175
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,799
Pray tell.

176
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:05,579
I'm getting engaged on the day after tomorrow.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,370
They'd sent a ring,

178
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,390
As in, they want me to see it and say that I like it.

179
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,840
But I didn't like it.

180
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,430
It must've been a gold ring...

181
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,488
No,

182
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:24,220
It was a diamong ring.

183
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,745
But I didn't like it.

184
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,270
Why not?

185
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,770
Hey!

186
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,650
Sit down, will you?

187
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,330
If you kept standing like that, it'd feel like you'd refuse if I asked for anything.

188
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,230
Hey!

189
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,340
Who could ever refuse you anything here?

190
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,880
Ask for whatever you want without any hesitation.

191
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,050
I want the ring, Aunt,

192
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,960
That Uncle Reverend had had made for me.

193
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,559
Oh, that inexpensive ring -- what would you do with that?

194
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,100
And never wear that accursed ring on an auspicious day.

195
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,016
I'd have thrown it away

196
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:10,037
Had the wretched thing not been made of gold!

197
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:13,172
I'd only wear that ring, Aunt.

198
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:15,076
If I wore any other,

199
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:17,000
It'd gnaw at my finger every moment.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,880
You're not getting that ring, Farah.

201
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,389
It's a memory of the day that's led us to these.

202
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:29,960
And Mum's reasoning is true, too -

203
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,800
One doesn't wear such accursed things on an auspicious day.

204
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,220
I want the same ring, Aunt.

205
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,910
I beg you.

206
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,099
This isn't proper, Farah.

207
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:52,210
You're resolute to get something you'd so resolutely refused.

208
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,670
And whom are you asking?

209
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,070
Dad took it out of his pocket and threw it away the moment he entered,

210
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,780
And Mum never saw it again.

211
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,710
I've got it with me.

212
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,590
I look at it whenever I tear up at my brother's fate.

213
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,680
So, forgive me,

214
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,270
But you're never going to get that ring.

215
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,320
Here, my dear, have your favourite coconut biscuits.

216
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,560
I'd promised you yesterday, hadn't I?

217
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,140
But she's left!

218
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,200
What happened to her?

219
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,070
She'd come to get the ring we'd had made for Afzal's engagement.

220
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,380
Why?

221
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,740
She's getting engaged the day after tomorrow.

222
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,390
She says she'd only wear that ring on her engagement.

223
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,005
Where's the ring?

224
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,740
Arifa's got it safely with her.

225
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,820
Then, tell Arifa to give it to her.

226
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,680
She's left weeping at such a trifle!

227
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,250
Why don't you talk to Arifa?

228
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,340
She's left me speechless.

229
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,385
Hey!

230
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,691
What would you say the next time you come?

231
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,980
You didn't get it, did you?

232
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,087
You said when you met me yesterday, 'I don't love you',

233
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,710
Today, you said,

234
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,930
'I love someone else',

235
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,970
So, tell me as you're leaving,

236
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,691
What would you say when you come tomorrow?

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,290
Why not say everything at once,

238
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,982
And check

239
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:18,079
How much Jasmine can take?

240
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm not coming back, Jasmine.

241
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,310
There!

242
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,490
You've been learning new ways to kill ever since you started murdering people.

243
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,761
Go and note it down, now,

244
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:38,320
That you've killed one Jasmine today, too.

245
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,100
This isn't proper, Farah.

246
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,600
You're resolute to get something you'd so resolutely refused.

247
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,219
And whom are you asking?

248
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,590
Dad took it out of his pocket and threw it away the moment he entered,

249
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,370
And Mum never saw it again.

250
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,820
I've got it with me.

251
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,903
I look at it whenever I tear up at my brother's fate.

252
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,970
So, forgive me,

253
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,950
But you're never going to get that ring.

254
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,280
Show me where it is!

255
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,670
Show you what?

256
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,746
The ring you like, of course!

257
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:34,200
You didn't get it?

258
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:39,494
Didn't you like it?

259
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:41,822
No, it's not like that.

260
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,550
I liked that ring.

261
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,695
Why did you leave it, then?

262
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:49,170
They didn't give it to me.

263
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,860
Oh...

264
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,080
Arifa must've refused.

265
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,810
How do you know where I'd gone to get the ring?

266
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,730
Did Arifa call you?

267
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,100
Not at all.

268
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,690
I found out from my experience.

269
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,210
The thing is,

270
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,321
One girl in love

271
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:16,232
Knows another inside out!

272
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,384
I knew it the very moment

273
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:23,319
You'd kicked away a ring that cost 170,000 Rupees!

274
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,480
Mum had said it clearly,

275
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,300
'This isn't about liking',

276
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,010
'But about devotion'.

277
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,080
But why do you have such a devoted attachment to that ring?

278
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,040
Well,

279
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,890
Time's running out.

280
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,710
The day after tomorrow is just around the corner, and you're bothered about a ring that isn't even yours!

281
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,630
How come it isn't mine?

282
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,310
Surely, it <i>is</i> mine.

283
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,740
Now, I can't say that the ring is yours...

284
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,002
But, surely,

285
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:17,120
It isn't an outsider's.

286
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,260
Why don't you go to her?

287
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,839
As in, to Arifa?

288
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,530
Yes.

289
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,254
She's your best friend.

290
00:21:23,254 --> 00:21:25,800
She won't refuse if you ask her.

291
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,080
Why, mate?

292
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,230
Why should I get you something that's rightfully mine?

293
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,991
Obviously,

294
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:41,220
They've kept it for an auspicious purpose.

295
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,080
Why would they put it on someone else's bride?

296
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,710
Tell Mum, then,

297
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,870
This engagement can't go forward.

298
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,778
I'd already said so

299
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:52,119
When you dashed upstairs, stupefied,

300
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,220
I told Mum right then,

301
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,970
That she couldn't get the ring,

302
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,200
And I'd even told her that the engagement can't go forward now.

303
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,580
Then?

304
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,640
What, 'then'?

305
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,660
Mum said,

306
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,040
'In that case, she'd be getting married the day after tomorrow'.

307
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,739
Look, Farah,

308
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:19,329
Please, show some sense.

309
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,816
Everything's going against you,

310
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,480
And when Afzal's out of the picture for you anyhow,

311
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,250
What would you do with his ring?

312
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,870
I say,

313
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,040
You'd better not test your would-be husband's sense of honour.

314
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:35,092
Look,

315
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,627
Get me the ring.

316
00:22:36,627 --> 00:22:39,327
You may have Afzal if you want.

317
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,830
What?

318
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,190
Think carefully, Farah,

319
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,661
You're offering me more than you can dare to.

320
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,430
I think the Reverend's sobs have struck me.

321
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,740
If I wore the same ring on my engagement,

322
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,000
It'd ease this burden on me.

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,730
If Afzal's taken a liking to you,

324
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,390
He's all yours from now on,

325
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,630
But even today, the ring is mine.

326
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,354
She's teaching the kids these days.

327
00:23:50,354 --> 00:23:53,640
She says it's a greater challenge than getting married.

328
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,160
One's got a finger in his nose, another's got an itch in his underarm.

329
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,581
And when she asked one to recite his lesson, he was sleeping.

330
00:23:59,581 --> 00:24:01,192
And one lad's a proper royal -

331
00:24:01,192 --> 00:24:02,470
He asks, 'Miss',

332
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,620
'Why does 9 + 9'

333
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,360
'Equal 18'?

334
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,811
'Why not 19'?

335
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,691
The kid asked her that one?

336
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,702
Yes, he asked her.

337
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,092
You're mad.

338
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:18,303
<i>She</i> was asking <i>you</i> this one.

339
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:20,800
Look,

340
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,500
'9 + 9' means 'Afzal + the one who writes him letters',

341
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,800
Which would add up to 18.

342
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,710
But when you can never get the one who writes you letters,

343
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,675
Why can't 9 + 9

344
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:33,863
Equal 19?

345
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,190
And 19 means

346
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,450
'Afzal + Jasmine'.

347
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,730
You've been failing Maths all your life,

348
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,470
And now, you're telling me that 9 + 9 equals 19?

349
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,861
So does that mean that because I don't love her,

350
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,260
9 + 9 can't equal 19?

351
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,110
More than half the marriages in our country follow this formula.

352
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,461
Only in textbooks does 9 + 9 equal 18.

353
00:24:57,461 --> 00:24:58,602
Practically,

354
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:01,953
It's always either 19 or 17.

355
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:04,290
Anyway,

356
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,160
Tell me,

357
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,620
Why did you go there?

358
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,910
Why did you go there when you'd told her yesterday that you don't love her?

359
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,781
Just went there.

360
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:21,521
I thought I'd just as well tell her that I love someone else.

361
00:25:22,892 --> 00:25:25,177
Why are you laughing?

362
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:28,590
You could start sitting with the kids she teaches,

363
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,400
With your finger in your nose one moment, itching your underarm another; and when asked to recite the lesson, just sleeping peacefully.

364
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,543
But please don't tell such a blatant lie.

365
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:37,560
It's not a lie, Babloo.

366
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,380
I've got proof.

367
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,264
I've told her that I'm never coming back.

368
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:44,139
I agree that she's very nice,

369
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:46,420
And loves me a lot.

370
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,671
It must've really hurt her to hear that I love someone else,

371
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:52,190
But what could I do, Babloo?

372
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,139
She's treading down the same path as I am,

373
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:57,230
And she, too, would find nothing down it.

374
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,970
You sound wicked when you say that, Afzal.

375
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,911
It sounds like the owner of a river pitying the thirsty but not giving him a drop.

376
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:11,448
May God forgive you for being such a miser.

377
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,232
Didn't I say

378
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,109
She'd be sitting on the swing?

379
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,350
You're here again?

380
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,630
Why must you drop in so suddenly?

381
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,720
At least leave me alone for two days.

382
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,280
Finished yet?

383
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,881
Sit on the swing and listen to me quietly.

384
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,139
There's insolence in my profession, but not disgraceful shamelessness!

385
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:16,840
What do you mean?

386
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,710
I've heard everything about your drama.

387
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,370
I didn't even want to come,

388
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,809
But I thought I'd see for myself what you're made of!

389
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,380
Watch your words there!

390
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,120
How dare you!

391
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,093
Hey!

392
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:28,660
Get him out of my sights!

393
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,710
Look at how he's bossing over me!

394
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,010
I haven't even started bossing over you!

395
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,620
I'll tell you when you get to my place!

396
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,289
And don't you dare talk about me so rudely.

397
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm not the kind

398
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,040
Who'd mistake such discourtesies as affection!

399
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,970
It is pure insolence to me.

400
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,010
Lubna!

401
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,049
Lubna!

402
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,220
Why are you calling Lubna? Talk to me.

403
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,620
What's this

404
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,199
Engagement ring drama you've started?

405
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,710
I didn't like your ring.

406
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,211
You didn't like a ring worth 170,000 Rupees.

407
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:09,890
So,

408
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,800
Please show me the one you like.

409
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,021
I will when I get it.

410
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:17,321
Where'd you get it from?

411
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,470
I know about that, too.

412
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,210
So, rings with a dubious sanctity would be used on the engagement of a psychiatrist like myself!

413
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,610
Pray tell, also, how much that ring costs.

414
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,330
More than the price,

415
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,030
Think about how much I like that ring.

416
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,320
You're rather dubious, too, when it comes to what you like.

417
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,050
Shut up!

418
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,050
Then listen carefully -

419
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,401
An engagement isn't destined for that ring.

420
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,800
Put it clearly.

421
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,270
What do you mean?

422
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,560
What do I tell you what it means?

423
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,650
The thing is,

424
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,630
You don't deserve me.

425
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,580
I don't deserve you?

426
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,590
Nobody's told you, apparently,

427
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,440
Many psychiatrists have sacrificed their love for the sake of their honour.

428
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,121
I'm your doctor,

429
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:08,460
I know it very well that you're a bit round the twist.

430
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,965
You're remembering your old ring today; you might remember your old lover tomorrow.

431
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,045
No.

432
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,840
No chance. Never.

433
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,200
This engagement isn't possible.

434
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,986
My foot!

435
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:24,917
You'll know about 'foot' when your Paw gets the news.

436
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:25,940
Say, then,

437
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,552
'My foot'!

438
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:35,010
If the Lord wills it, your feet would've been chopped off the next time we meet!

439
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,920
Hey!

440
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,120
Why are you so furious?

441
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,360
I've just sacrificed my love for the sake of my honour!

442
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,890
Please tell me in simpler terms - what have you just done?

443
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,122
I've called the engagement off.

444
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:11,443
I've called the engagement off.
-What?

445
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,956
I've put it plainly -

446
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:15,853
If that accursed ring is used on the engagement,

447
00:30:15,853 --> 00:30:18,514
I'm not getting engaged.

448
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,083
Lubna!

449
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,470
Lubna!

450
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,300
What is it?

451
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,758
Why are you so worked up?
-The engagement's broken...

452
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,970
He's found out about everything, hasn't he? He was trembling out of disgrace.

453
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,760
But however did he find out?

454
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,556
Who could've told him but <i>you</i>?

455
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,580
You?

456
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,710
Hadn't you told him?

457
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,690
Don't you remember when you'd gone to him for your treatment?

458
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:53,370
You'd told him the entire story about Afzal in three hours.

459
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,320
That's right...

460
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,720
You must've told him about the incident with the ring, too.

461
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,751
Perhaps...

462
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,720
But who told him that I'm going to wear the same ring on the engagement?

463
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,930
I did.

464
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,710
It just slipped out...

465
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,690
What it is is I don't like to lie to someone so close.

466
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,780
There!

467
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,230
You're not a sister,

468
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,910
You're a snake, Lubna Ibrahim,

469
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,950
That's been biting me ever since!

470
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,251
You're such a thankless girl!

471
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:22,507
You forgot in one moment

472
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,910
Everything I've sacrificed for you!

473
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,020
I've told the truth and lied for you,

474
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,950
Taken slaps and scolding,

475
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:32,160
And you're saying today that I'm a snake?

476
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,000
Alright.

477
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,530
If I'm a snake to you,

478
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,760
Stay away from me!

479
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,430
Call him!

480
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,060
I asked you to call him right now!

481
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,090
And tell him

482
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,200
That I've agreed.

483
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,206
'Agreed', as in?

484
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,180
Tell him I'd wear his diamond ring on my engagement.

485
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,951
He shouldn't break the engagement, or Dad would kill me for real.

486
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,081
Do you know what he'd said?

487
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,451
He said I'm 'a bit round the twist'!

488
00:32:02,451 --> 00:32:07,041
'You're remembering your old ring today; you might remember your old lover tomorrow'.

489
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:08,921
Go and tell him

490
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,212
I'm not the type.

491
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,510
You said when you met me yesterday, 'I don't love you',

492
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,137
Today, you told,

493
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:59,360
'I love someone else',

494
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
So, tell me as you're leaving,

495
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,320
What would you say when you come tomorrow?

496
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,650
Why not say everything at once,

497
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,250
And check

498
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,280
How much Jasmine can take?

499
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,140
I'm not coming back, Jasmine.

500
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,530
There!

501
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,690
You've been learning new ways to kill ever since you started murdering people.

502
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,986
Go and note it down, now,

503
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:25,002
That you've killed one Jasmine today, too.

504
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,846
Jasmine!

505
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:05,429
Jasmine!

506
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:08,256
Wake up! It's almost the afternoon!

507
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,548
Didn't the kids come?

508
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:12,999
They won't be coming today.

509
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:14,440
It's Sunday.

510
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,470
You'd said it yourself that Sunday's a holiday.

511
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:18,520
There.

512
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,040
Why had I said that?

513
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,956
Is this a school that'd have an off on Sundays?

514
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:01,730
I don't love you, Jasmine,

515
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,242
And I'm not worthy of being loved, now, either.

516
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,681
Drop me at my place.

517
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,730
The kid asked her that one?

518
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,810
Yes, he asked her.

519
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,190
You're mad.

520
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:28,417
<i>She</i> was asking <i>you</i> this one.

521
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:30,860
Look,

522
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,560
'9 + 9' means 'Afzal + the one who writes him letters',

523
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,880
Which would add up to 18.

524
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,770
But when you can never get the one who writes you letters,

525
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,740
Why can't 9 + 9

526
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,990
Equal 19?

527
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,996
And 19 means

528
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:48,907
'Afzal + Jasmine'.

529
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,139
Hey, Eladio!

530
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:15,559
Where are you off to?

531
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,005
Hyderabad.

532
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,140
Have these four days been enough to satisfy you?

533
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,540
No.

534
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,000
It's not been enough.

535
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
I've got to go for the engagement.

536
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,730
I'll be back in a few days.

537
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,690
You're getting engaged?

538
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,670
I'm not getting engaged, mate.

539
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,320
Good old Mlle Farah,

540
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,280
The daughter of Monseigneur Ibrahim, the mill owner?

541
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,686
The daughter of Monseigneur Ibrahim, the mill owner? She's getting engaged.

542
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,361
Mum asked me to come.

543
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,640
'Attend the engagement',

544
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,031
'And meet me, too'.

545
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,120
May I go, now?

546
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,573
S -- Sure,

547
00:36:50,573 --> 00:36:51,954
Go...

548
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,300
Will you get engaged to me?

549
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,647
Why are you laughing?

550
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:59,920
You asked me, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

551
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,240
Why didn't you ask, 'Will you marry me'?

552
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,350
Or is it that you intend to shoo me away at the engagement?
-No way!

553
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,006
I accidentally said 'engaged' instead of 'married'.

554
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,057
Mam!

555
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,850
Why are you calling your Mum?

556
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,870
You're proposing me for marriage.

557
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,870
I have to discuss with Mam.

558
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,470
Just pray that she accepts it.

559
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,100
You accept it, don't you?

560
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,810
Now,

561
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,280
I get proposals like this every now and then.

562
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,677
But girls don't decide in a moment.

563
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,240
It takes about a week or so

564
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,850
To arrive at a decision.

565
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,850
I don't have a week or so.

566
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,810
If you accept, we're getting engaged tomorrow.

567
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,650
What if I don't agree to tomorrow?

568
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,186
If you agree to get engaged, why not agree to the date as well?

569
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:46,740
Just think as if

570
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,989
I'm adamant over it.

571
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,660
So you're adamant over it!

572
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,966
You haven't fallen in love with me.

573
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,880
Come with me.

574
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,457
I'm taking him upstairs.

575
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,750
It's a case of memory loss.

576
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,906
Sit down.

577
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,780
Tell me, now,

578
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,750
Who are you obdurate against?

579
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,101
Won't you share what lies in your heart with the one you'd get engaged to?

580
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,496
She's getting engaged tomorrow.

581
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,890
You're exacting your revenge?

582
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,956
She doesn't love you, does she?

583
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,382
You don't love me, either.

584
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,412
How would I get even with you?

585
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,510
By getting engaged to you?

586
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:16,330
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

587
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,187
And please Jasmine, too!

588
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,850
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Jasmine'.

589
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,931
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

590
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,830
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

591
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,619
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

592
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:40,380
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

593
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,290
I'm serious, Jasmine.

594
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,070
I've come here with a proposal.

595
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,240
I'm serious, too, Afzal.

596
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,840
I reject your proposal.

597
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
