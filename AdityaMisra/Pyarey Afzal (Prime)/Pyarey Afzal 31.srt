1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,918
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:19,150
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:30,619
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:36,190
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,856
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,660
Sit down.

8
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,522
Tell me, now,

9
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:56,087
Who are you obdurate against?

10
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:03,997
Won't you share what lies in your heart with the one you'd get engaged to?

11
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,483
She's getting engaged tomorrow.

12
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:12,780
You're exacting your revenge?

13
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,564
She doesn't love you, does she?

14
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,122
You don't love me, either.

15
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:28,989
How would I get even with you?

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,903
By getting engaged to you?

17
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,060
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

18
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,942
And please Jasmine, too!

19
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,647
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Jasmine'.

20
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:50,925
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

21
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,610
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

22
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,370
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

23
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,175
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

24
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:04,081
I'm serious, Jasmine.

25
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:05,867
I've come here with a proposal.

26
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,019
I'm serious, too, Afzal.

27
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,972
I reject your proposal.

28
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,674
Come.

29
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,501
Mam would've dreamt about a lot, seeing this meeting...

30
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,682
Let's shatter everything in a moment.

31
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,224
Wait, Jasmine.

32
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,190
I give you my word,

33
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,855
I'll marry you and only you if I get engaged to you.

34
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:55,050
You could --

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,238
You could think I've fallen in love with you.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,572
You lie so artfully, boyo!

37
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,265
It almost sounds like you're honest.

38
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,661
Alright, if you're honest,

39
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:14,130
Prove it to me.

40
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,390
Change the date of the engagement.

41
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,518
I won't change it to any day after tomorrow.

42
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:23,890
Then, how about a day earlier?

43
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,553
If you've bought the ring,

44
00:04:26,553 --> 00:04:28,976
Put it on me today.

45
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,520
But you can have one thing in writing -

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,010
If she's getting engaged tomorrow,

47
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,077
I'm not getting engaged to you tomorrow.

48
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:47,358
Come downstairs if you're in the mood to get engaged.

49
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:51,534
Or I'll look down from the window and see that you're leaving.

50
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,324
Why are you panting?

51
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:15,053
Just a minute.

52
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,882
Where's Afzal?

53
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,437
We'll know in a moment.

54
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,151
Jasmine!

55
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,940
He's left, Mam.

56
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,272
He'd come over with a plan to come,

57
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:06,364
And he took the option to leave.

58
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,661
You refused?

59
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,560
You know

60
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,626
That I couldn't have refused!

61
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,335
Why did he leave, then?

62
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,721
We had a row over the date of the engagement.

63
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:20,900
I wanted the date of the new moon,

64
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,181
And he wanted the date of the lunar eclipse.

65
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,030
I said it too,

66
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,955
Whether or not we get engaged, I'm not agreeing to the date of the eclipse.

67
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,240
He won't come again.

68
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,038
I, too, pray that he never come now.

69
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,830
Promise me, then,

70
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,020
That you will never weep for him again.

71
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,257
You're not intelligent at all, Mam!

72
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:50,500
I don't weep for him.

73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,014
I weep at the love that I have for that eejit.

74
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,530
If I've shed a few tears to get over this sorrow, don't think that I'm weeping.

75
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,320
What is that?

76
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,719
Shoes...

77
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,676
I've brought --

78
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,530
Shoes for you.

79
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,046
But why?

80
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,019
Know what,

81
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:28,300
I've got five pairs here,

82
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,583
And two lying in the car.

83
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,861
I've settled for these after a lot of searching... All different types!

84
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,668
Each better than the other!

85
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,260
Take the ones you like. Hi, Lubna!

86
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,367
Hi!

87
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:39,524
Why have you brought these?

88
00:07:39,524 --> 00:07:40,794
Silly question!

89
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,759
Who asks one's fiancé why he's brought gifts?

90
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,644
Who's bought them?

91
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:50,089
I have, of course! It took me two hours to get them!

92
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,107
So I'd wear shoes of your choice?

93
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,895
No, you'd wear shoes of your choice.

94
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:54,930
I've got so many.

95
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,433
Keep the ones you like, and return the others.

96
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,940
How do you know my shoe size?

97
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,860
C'mon, Farah,

98
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,560
When you said 'My foot' the other day, my eyes darted to your feet.

99
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,773
It's 7, innit?

100
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,674
7 is Lubna's size.

101
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:11,710
My shoe size is 6.

102
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,030
Oh...

103
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,803
What's going on?

104
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:16,951
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

105
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,628
And upon you, peace.

106
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,804
Sibtain's brought shoes for Farah.

107
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,132
How cute!

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,320
It's not cute, Mum.

109
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,460
Who buys shoes for his girl?

110
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,961
The things men do in love...

111
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:34,260
Don't look at the shoes;

112
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,240
Look at his love.

113
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,322
You can look at size 7 shoes

114
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,249
If not wear them.

115
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,800
I can wear them.

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,235
What other hand-me-downs do you want?

117
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,099
Anyway,

118
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,875
Take these shoes away,

119
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,567
And get me size 6 ones.

120
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,020
How different is it, really?

121
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,568
And, frankly speaking,

122
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,800
Everyone will be looking at the girl's face.

123
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,921
Only the husband looks at her feet.

124
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,030
I should go after her, shouldn't I?

125
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,510
I should go after her, shouldn't I?
-Double time!

126
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,170
May I come in?

127
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,185
What is it now?

128
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:46,124
Nothing, really.

129
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:49,183
I'd just come to say

130
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:52,629
That you should've taken a look at the shoes...

131
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,209
I will.

132
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,433
It would've delighted my heart if you'd only tried them on for once...

133
00:09:58,433 --> 00:09:59,970
Just decide in one shot

134
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,780
What I have to do to delight you.

135
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,260
Nothing much.

136
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,780
I'd even be delighted to see you happy.

137
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,680
And the truth is I'd come to make you happy, and not to be delighted myself.

138
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
And I'm chuffed to see 7 pairs of size 7 shoes!

139
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,340
Look,

140
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,328
We're getting engaged tomorrow.

141
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,096
I mean,

142
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,541
Our sorrows and happiness will be united.

143
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,463
Likewise, if our love is united,

144
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,854
Our feelings, and our thoughts are united,

145
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,764
People would hail us as the ideal couple.

146
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:28,532
Get to the point.

147
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:32,105
What could be a more important point than love?

148
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:35,891
If only you paid attention to the 'points'...

149
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,421
If you don't let your heart connect with your mind, how will a link form,

150
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:43,462
And, in the absence of such a link, you are always unsettled, restless, and troubled.

151
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,340
Is that you telling me about my illness?

152
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,630
Don't you dare, you bloody psychiatrist!

153
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,157
I'm not trying to prove myself to be a bloody psychiatrist at all.

154
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,438
I was actually

155
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,643
Telling you a lover's point of view.

156
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:57,770
Lover?

157
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,570
M --
-Please don't say anything starting with 'My foot'!

158
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,708
A psychiatrist can take his insult,

159
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,220
But love never takes any insult.

160
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,570
The thing is, you need someone who loves you intensely for such turbulence,

161
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,891
Provided, of course, that you love him intensely, too.

162
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,502
Fortunately,

163
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:17,204
Such a lover is available to you,

164
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:18,819
But unfortunately,

165
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:21,018
You aren't available to him.

166
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,302
Got your ring?

167
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,950
Which ring?

168
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,560
The engagement ring.

169
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,660
I'd returned it to you, hadn't I?

170
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,530
I'm not asking about that ring.

171
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,247
Tell me about the one you'd returned

172
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:35,331
Tell me about the one you'd returned with the fiancé.

173
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,880
I've decided

174
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,970
That I can't turn down such a trifling wish of my fiancée's.

175
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,929
You'd wear the same engagement ring tomorrow.

176
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:54,352
What's his Paw's name?

177
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:56,024
Whose Dad?

178
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,299
The bloke you folks call 'Afzal'.

179
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,090
Afzal's his name.

180
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,918
I'm asking his Paw's name.

181
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,400
Subhanallah [Praise the Lord].

182
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,331
Keep praising the Lord later; first, tell me his Paw's name.

183
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,970
Subhanallah is his name.

184
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,048
Subhanallah [Praise the Lord]!

185
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:15,860
Then, Mr Subhanallah will put the ring on you tomorrow.

186
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,020
Paw's said this will heal his heart's wound.

187
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,610
There's nothing like a wound on a heart, really, though.

188
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,873
But Paw said it so convincingly that I thought

189
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,317
That it's something beyond science.

190
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,490
Well,

191
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,914
I'd only come to say that.

192
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,624
Hey!

193
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,560
I'll wear those size 7 shoes.

194
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,214
Arifa!

195
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,793
Coming, Dad.

196
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,876
Yes, Dad?

197
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,430
Let me come in first.

198
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,520
Sure,

199
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,974
Come.

200
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,324
Do you remember the last time you'd come inside my room?

201
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,216
I don't, either!

202
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:36,342
I just remember

203
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,790
That I'd fallen down while playing on the stairs.

204
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,440
My nose got hurt, I fell unconscious.

205
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,030
That's when you'd come running from the Mosque.

206
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,630
I've heard you'd spent the entire night sitting by me?

207
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,910
Chanting prayers,

208
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,380
Saying to God,

209
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,362
'Make her come to, O Lord',

210
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:56,529
'Or I may miss the morning prayers'!

211
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:58,637
Please, sit.

212
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,990
The thing is,

213
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,490
The rooms

214
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,366
Of the mother and the daughter are places where one should show the utmost respect.

215
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:11,664
One doesn't just go there the way

216
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:15,682
I'd barge into Afzal's room.

217
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,767
Why don't you sit, too?

218
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,990
You've come inside my room after so many years,

219
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,736
So, tell me,

220
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,148
What'd you like to have?

221
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:32,710
You've half taken after your mother.

222
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,893
You keep your heart's secrets locked deep inside.

223
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,600
Alright,

224
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,890
I'd come inside your room

225
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,529
Every once in a while.

226
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,176
In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

227
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,482
Alright,

228
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:51,486
Tell me,

229
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:53,872
Where's the ring?

230
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:55,740
Ring?

231
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,166
You'd better not ask 'Which ring'.

232
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,070
You know it very well.

233
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,787
I'd thrown it away because

234
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:09,100
Ruqaiyya had thought of getting something else made from it,

235
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,819
Or selling it

236
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:13,360
To get some money.

237
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,625
Why had you kept it with you?

238
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,771
Just kept it...

239
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:20,810
As a reminder.

240
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,950
A reminder of what?

241
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,300
What good is it to us?

242
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,800
I didn't think of what good it is.

243
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,360
I just thought that we'd had it made for my brother's fiancée,

244
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,758
So, it's for the memory.

245
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:39,102
A memory of what, my dear?

246
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,135
Would you show us such things

247
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,708
To torment us further?

248
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,970
Go and see.

249
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,116
We've even taken his picture off from the room.

250
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,492
No, Dad...

251
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,360
You haven't taken it off from the room.

252
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,500
Mum's just changed where it's kept.

253
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,840
It's underneath her pillow now.

254
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,411
There...

255
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,390
Whoever would tell her

256
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,430
That one's only got a confrontation destined with sin;

257
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,300
One doesn't have any ties.

258
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,700
So, do you have no ties with him, now?

259
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,113
Have you forgotten that he's your son?

260
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:22,677
I've heard that you'd sat next to Farah to glimpse Afzal?

261
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:26,000
That was just -- that day...

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,124
I'd just mentioned his name for your mother's happiness...

263
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:32,170
She's

264
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,519
Got a frail heart, right?

265
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,100
So have I got a very strong heart, Dad?

266
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,783
I'm his sister.

267
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,505
If I'm tormented for him, I'm tormented again to see Mum.

268
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,040
I mean,

269
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,753
I'm tormented more than Mum.

270
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:53,766
The two of you will bring me to tears one day!

271
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,950
And remember,

272
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,990
A judgement will be pronounced against me

273
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,066
The day I wept!

274
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:02,845
No judgement will be pronounced, Dad.

275
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:07,020
Who says that if He can understand a mother's heart, He cannot understand a father's heart?

276
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,100
Perhaps a judgement may be pronounced over a father who did not weep even after his son left?

277
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,256
Just try to weep on this pretext for once, Dad.

278
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:21,840
Who knows, He may just be waiting for you to weep?

279
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,221
By the Lord, Dad,

280
00:17:30,221 --> 00:17:32,050
Don't cry.

281
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,660
You just asked me to weep...

282
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,140
I'd asked you to weep, Dad.

283
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,072
I didn't ask you to show me that you're weeping.

284
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,794
Alright,

285
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:55,280
Give me the ring.

286
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,450
What'd you do with it?

287
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,389
She'd come utterly dispirited and penitent;

288
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,340
Seeing her, it occurred to me

289
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,680
That sometimes, the most brutal punishment you can mete out

290
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,810
To someone who had no mercy on you

291
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,006
Is to be merciful.

292
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,620
So, give it, my dear.

293
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,914
It'll be our tribute of

294
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:28,199
19,700 from us to her.

295
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:33,819
One gives something on the occasion of an engagement, right?

296
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,580
One doesn't give with a generous heart to someone who's broken one's heart, Dad,

297
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,964
Which is why I won't give her the ring.

298
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,900
I'd have earrings made from it,

299
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,770
Or sell it to get some money.

300
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,610
She'd have only blessings for us

301
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,044
If it satisfies her.

302
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,700
Take the blessings, my dear.

303
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,009
The ring won't be of any use.

304
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,770
The blessings would be of great use.

305
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,250
If someone else put my brother's ring on her,

306
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,960
I may utter a curse!

307
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,990
Just pray that she be saved from my curse.

308
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,160
Leave it be, Reverend.

309
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,734
Don't attack frail hearts, emboldened by your own strong heart.

310
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:16,813
If she were so penitent,

311
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:19,810
She could've asked for the one that ring was from.

312
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,016
By the Lord, I'd have gotten her what she wanted.

313
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,010
Did you see that?

314
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,508
She's thrown a jibe of 'strong-hearted' too!

315
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:41,800
Tell her, sometime,

316
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,650
That this strong-hearted man

317
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,240
Had wept at one command of yours.

318
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,260
Good night.

319
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,930
She won't give me the ring.

320
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,540
She gets an itch to exact her revenge every so often.

321
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,370
Although her Mum and Dad

322
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,010
Have forgotten the incident at the engagement,

323
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,480
She doesn't seem to forget.

324
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,640
I can even read her expressions.

325
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,730
If she smiles while looking at me, it feels

326
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,620
As if she's cursing me.

327
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,030
And when her Mum smiles?

328
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,560
How do you feel then?

329
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,720
Normal.

330
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,090
Completely normal.

331
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,850
Then, you just note Arifa's expressions.

332
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,903
You haven't the foggiest about her.

333
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:30,240
Not at all.

334
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,450
She says

335
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,790
That she sees Afzal in me.

336
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,740
They're God's dearest, Mademoiselle.

337
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,380
They are courteous to guests.

338
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,290
What do you mean?

339
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,095
I've seen their smile.

340
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:43,720
You'll see,

341
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,869
She'd kill you with the same smile one day.

342
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,600
It isn't really a smile...

343
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,430
It's perplexity

344
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,250
That's set in on her lips.

345
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,190
Perplexity about what?

346
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,610
How you're still able to get up and walk!

347
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,320
First, she'd have thought

348
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,611
That one smile would kill you,

349
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:11,830
Or that her second will cause the ground to be cleft asunder, and you, with all your cardinal sins, shall be plunged into the abyss.

350
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,780
But that didn't happen.

351
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,046
So, pray that she doesn't attend your engagement tomorrow.

352
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,964
What could happen if she attended my engagement?

353
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,360
Seeing you as a bride would torment her.

354
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,983
An ember would emanate from her eye, which would turn you to ash.

355
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:30,674
Then, she'd better come.

356
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,920
Let me see, too, how the ember emanates from her eye,

357
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,922
And how it turns me to ash.

358
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,652
Your face looks very spooky.

359
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,328
Leave my face be;

360
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:46,359
Think of how you'd look when you'd have turned to ash.

361
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,720
Put a sock in it.

362
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,163
I chant my own funeral prayers thrice every day.

363
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,394
It's for the better.

364
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,159
One should keep on doing that.

365
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,660
Someone else may be praying in your place tomorrow.

366
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,350
So, all those conversations,

367
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,300
All that affection, all those blandishments -

368
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,640
Is all of it a lie?

369
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,240
She'd call me up to her

370
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,840
And ward troubles off me.

371
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,030
She keeps her enemy alive.

372
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,210
She's decided to kill you with her own two hands.

373
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,870
And Uncle Reverend?

374
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,290
He'd brought coconut biscuits for me.

375
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,490
He always says,

376
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,800
'Let Farah not leave empty-handed'.

377
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,670
That's just a matter of getting even.

378
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,810
Remember

379
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,820
How you'd not let him leave empty-handed either?

380
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,490
You'd packed for him a lifetime's worth of sorrow, saying,

381
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,790
'Go'.

382
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,317
'Forget your son and live with this sorrow'.

383
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,730
Now, he lives with the sorrow you've given them,

384
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,957
And gives you coconut biscuits in thanksgiving.

385
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,895
You're envious, aren't you?

386
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,346
Envious?

387
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,790
It pains you to see, doesn't it,

388
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,020
How Afzal's family loves me so much?

389
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,992
What does this chuckle mean?

390
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,534
Nothing, really.

391
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,489
I chuckle when I hear you say 'Afzal' and 'love' in the same line.

392
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:24,670
Forget about everything.

393
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,760
Just concentrate on your engagement.

394
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,990
Tell Sibtain that I can't get that ring.

395
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,620
I don't want to pick a fight with Arifa.

396
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,290
You've already picked a fight with her.

397
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,400
Did you have to ask for the ring?

398
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,900
Here, their wounds start healing,

399
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,220
And there you are to rub salt in them.

400
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,850
Granted that you regret what you've done,

401
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,390
But who'd like the idea of wearing an old ring at a new engagement?

402
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,670
Sibtain could even die for you,

403
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,780
Which is why he's at your service with the shoes and his head.

404
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,020
Otherwise, if you'd wear a ring sent by his corrival,

405
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,490
It'll be the last nail in the coffin of the lover's honour.

406
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,580
Who's this corrival?

407
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,670
I'm talking about poor old Afzal.

408
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,590
He'd have gotten the news.

409
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,650
Ah, yes.

410
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,590
Eladio's come over from there.

411
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,020
He's told him about your engagement.

412
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,990
He'd have gotten the news.

413
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,490
Just watch what happens next...

414
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,092
What?

415
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:20,391
He won't remain at peace.

416
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,840
Would he come?

417
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,226
So, do you mean

418
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:28,010
That he'd try to stop the engagement?

419
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,220
He isn't the type.

420
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,640
What'd he do, then?

421
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,117
He'd give a befitting reply.

422
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,415
Well,

423
00:25:37,415 --> 00:25:40,090
Whatever can he do now?

424
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,688
Get engaged.

425
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,670
Get engaged, as in?

426
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,633
You're getting engaged tomorrow,

427
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:50,270
And you'll see, he'd get engaged tomorrow, too.

428
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,318
To whom?

429
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:54,180
He's got an affair going on with you,

430
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,187
Whom would he get engaged to?

431
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,081
Jasmine.

432
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,860
So wasn't he serious with you?

433
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,510
He was very serious,

434
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,470
But she'll be the only one available to him at a moment's notice.

435
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:10,315
Plus, she'd agree, too.

436
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,754
The blighter...

437
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,132
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

438
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,003
And please Jasmine, too!

439
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,710
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Jasmine'.

440
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,240
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

441
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,420
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

442
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,150
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

443
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,753
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

444
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:30,030
This number is on another call. Please wait.

445
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,010
Who is it?

446
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,990
It's Farah.

447
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,130
Farah who?

448
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,227
Don't you recognise me?

449
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:49,989
It's Farah...

450
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:51,488
I'd come from Hyderabad

451
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:52,799
With my Dad

452
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,680
Looking for Afzal?

453
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,960
Oh, yes...

454
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,408
I remember you well.

455
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:00,545
Haven't you saved my number?

456
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,260
I'd deliberately not saved it.

457
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Why?

458
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,480
I feared you might call.

459
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,950
How are you?

460
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,261
You're calling at 1 a.m.; haven't you found him yet?

461
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,310
Who's talking about him?

462
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,690
Just...

463
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,390
I was missing you

464
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,237
And thought I'd talk to you.

465
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,980
I'm sorry

466
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,930
But I think you were sleeping...

467
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,850
No, not at all.

468
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,226
I was awake.

469
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:29,804
In fact, I stay awake.

470
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:31,256
So,

471
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:32,680
What's up these days?

472
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,720
I've started teaching the kids.

473
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,970
Splendid.

474
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,750
That's very good.

475
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,583
That's just what's good now.

476
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,993
Has he left?

477
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:44,950
Are you talking about Afzal?

478
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,120
Yes.

479
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,670
He left a long while ago,

480
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,870
But he does pay a visit sometimes.

481
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,510
He's become a don now, hasn't he?

482
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,830
He'd said as he left,

483
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,340
'I'd come back a great man'.

484
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,450
I've heard he's earned a lot, too.

485
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,690
Don't you have his number?

486
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,330
What'd I do with his number?

487
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,800
Then, what'd you do to know about him?

488
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,500
That was just --

489
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,420
His name came up --

490
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,411
And I thought I'd ask about him.

491
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,076
So, tell me,

492
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,321
When are you getting married?

493
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:22,966
Why are you asking about my marriage?

494
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,281
Just asking.

495
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:27,850
That's what girls ask each other, innit?

496
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,361
Tell me, then,

497
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:31,680
When are you getting married?

498
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,949
Just about anytime now.

499
00:29:33,949 --> 00:29:36,378
I'm getting engaged tomorrow.

500
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,157
What happened?

501
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:43,163
Why this silence?

502
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,254
I'm a bit surprised.

503
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:46,602
What a coincidence,

504
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:49,539
Someone else is getting engaged tomorrow, too.

505
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,067
Afzal?

506
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:53,280
The one whom Afzal loves.

507
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,710
She's somewhere in Hyderabad.

508
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,677
Did he tell you that?

509
00:29:57,677 --> 00:29:59,628
When a lover flees from a city,

510
00:29:59,628 --> 00:30:02,387
One could think his lover lives there, innit?

511
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:04,082
Tell me her name.

512
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,139
Don't you know?

513
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:08,124
Her name's Farah.

514
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:10,207
I only know her name.

515
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,710
She's been writing him letters for years.

516
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,438
I've read a handful of them, too.

517
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,962
She opens with 'Dear Afzal',

518
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:20,951
And who knows what else she writes...

519
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,946
So that's some other Farah?

520
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,026
Obviously.

521
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,169
As if I write him letters!

522
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:29,346
She's getting engaged today, too?

523
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:30,830
Splendid...

524
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,465
That is grand.

525
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:34,360
It'll be grand now, Farah.

526
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,197
All three will get engaged on the same day.

527
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:38,525
Who's the third one?

528
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:40,347
Afzal.

529
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,864
Afzal?

530
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,739
So he's getting engaged tomorrow, too?

531
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,310
To whom?

532
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,960
To me.

533
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,070
I mean, he was asking me,

534
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,601
But I didn't agree to it.

535
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,810
Why?

536
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,329
I felt like he was calling out,

537
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:03,992
'Is there anyone who'd get engaged to me'?

538
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,180
Now, if one'd ask Jasmine like this,

539
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,760
Would Jasmine ever say 'Yes'?

540
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,594
I refused point blank.

541
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,660
Good.

542
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,440
But it won't do any good.

543
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,600
What do you mean?

544
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,290
He'll get engaged tomorrow, Farah.

545
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,741
At all costs.

546
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,300
Is there anyone else, too?

547
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,464
I mean, to whom if not you?

548
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,998
Could be anyone.

549
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:31,140
If he didn't get that muppet Farah, it doesn't mean he won't get anyone.

550
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,230
He'd find someone better.

551
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,877
He's a handsome lad, beaut.

552
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:37,370
Talks little,

553
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,750
But hears a lot;

554
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,150
Who knows how many would die for him!

555
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,210
Did he flatly say,

556
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,460
'Get engaged to me'?

557
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,405
Obviously.

558
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:49,200
And you refused.

559
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,896
Point blank.

560
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,680
I thought the two of you had something going on.

561
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,230
We could've had...

562
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,390
But I don't compromise on my principles. No.

563
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,980
What do I do, and what could love do, if he'd come from Hyderabad robbed?

564
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:09,409
Love has emphathy for robbed travellers, not affection.

565
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:11,256
I'll talk to you later...

566
00:32:11,256 --> 00:32:13,900
Should I give you his number?

567
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,630
No; what'd I do with his number?

568
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,970
Ask about the time of the engagement and the girl's name,

569
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,770
Or you'll be left asking me.

570
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,930
No way.

571
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,230
I just asked because his mention came up.

572
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,450
Alright, listen,

573
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,540
You'd keep your phone on, wouldn't you?

574
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,310
Why are you asking that?

575
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,910
I'd tell you if I found out the girl's name and the time of the engagement.

576
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,020
There's no need.

577
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,986
But my phone will be on.

578
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:45,023
Good night.

579
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,115
Good night.

580
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,220
Why are you laughing?

581
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,760
I'm laughing at the amount of flannel in love.

582
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,830
If only someone starts playing with it,

583
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,918
It plays with one like a child plays with his toys -

584
00:32:56,918 --> 00:32:58,230
Playing in the morning,

585
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,915
And breaking it by the evening.

586
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,190
Get up, Lubna.

587
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,982
Get up.

588
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,160
Tell me,

589
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,250
What happens next?

590
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,210
Next, as in?

591
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,200
What's up with you?

592
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,591
Easy there, sit down and talk.

593
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:39,588
Your predictions have been true.

594
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:41,820
More than half of them, actually.

595
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,150
He's getting engaged tomorrow,

596
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,293
And he'd proposed Jasmine first.

597
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,218
He's getting engaged to Jasmine?

598
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:51,090
No. Jasmine's said she won't get engaged to him.

599
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:54,429
And now, he's looking for someone else.

600
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,181
But who?

601
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:57,888
He'll find someone.

602
00:33:57,888 --> 00:33:59,153
'He's a handsome lad',

603
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,590
'Plus, he talks little',

604
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,760
'But hears a lot'.

605
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,330
What are you saying?

606
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,490
I'm not saying this,

607
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,080
Jasmine is.

608
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,350
Did you just talk to Jasmine?

609
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,580
Yes.

610
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,000
I couldn't sleep, so

611
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,670
I thought I'd talk to her.

612
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,780
She let the cat out of the bag the moment I started talking.

613
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,500
That's good.

614
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,598
What's good?

615
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:23,970
The blighter's counter-attacking me!

616
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:27,049
What do you call a counter-attack?

617
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:28,993
He's getting engaged on the day of my engagement.

618
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:30,752
What does that mean?

619
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:33,661
Why didn't he fix any other date?

620
00:34:33,661 --> 00:34:37,333
So much right is the least he's got.

621
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:39,116
After all, he's a Reverend's son,

622
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,209
So, he's only being as cruel as his own fate had been to him.

623
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:43,330
What do you mean?

624
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,407
Honestly?

625
00:34:44,407 --> 00:34:46,959
He should've gotten married by now.

626
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:51,130
In fact, he should've had one or two kids by the time you got married.

627
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,888
Don't you have the slightest sorrow?

628
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:56,293
Just tell me what your sorrow is.

629
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,080
Not sorrow,

630
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,835
But I feel pity.

631
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,010
He should be ashamed.

632
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,380
Nobody in his family knows that he's getting engaged.

633
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,928
Like we care, even if they don't know!

634
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:07,318
Call Arifa.

635
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:08,698
Why?

636
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:10,337
Let her know, too,

637
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:12,720
What the brother whose name fuels her pride

638
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,330
Has been up to!

639
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,370
You'd give her new grief?

640
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,090
I'd just inform her.

641
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,520
How many days have we wasted, looking for him!

642
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,460
Now that we've gotten wind of his exploits,

643
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,820
We're duty-bound to inform her instantly.

644
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,722
Call her.

645
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,380
You might even die of sorrow...

646
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,770
That which you'd tasted

647
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,090
Was not blood,

648
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,817
But the soot of disgrace, Lubna Ibrahim.

649
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,820
Yes, Lubna?

650
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,060
Not Lubna, it's Farah.

651
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,243
Everything alright?

652
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,962
Tell me after you've heard the news

653
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:06,948
If everything about it is alright.

654
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,778
What's the news?

655
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:12,390
He's fixed his engagement on the day of my engagement.

656
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,513
Who?

657
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,840
Your brother, obviously.

658
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,027
And would you look at that!

659
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:20,450
He's neither told you, nor invited you to the engagement.

660
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,510
He's getting engaged today?

661
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,700
Splendid.

662
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,470
Mum would dance a jig to hear it!

663
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,640
Dance a jig?

664
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,190
Wouldn't she feel sad at all that he's not invited you?

665
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,920
Not at all.

666
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,990
She'd say,

667
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,760
'The son's become an outsider, Arifa',

668
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,831
'But the daughter-in-law's our own'.

669
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:40,816
Who's the daughter-in-law -- I mean,

670
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:43,720
Whom is he getting engaged to?

671
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,840
He'd offered Jasmine first,

672
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,333
But she didn't agree.

673
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,610
But he agreed didn't he?

674
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,352
So, he'll get engaged.

675
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,098
Have you seen Jasmine?

676
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:58,788
Why are you asking that?

677
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:00,185
Just asking.

678
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,953
I thought I should know how she looks.

679
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,355
She looks good,

680
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,189
But she's very lippy.

681
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,561
If she looks good, a tad lippy will do.

682
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,860
Alright, I'll go tell Mum.
-Wait!

683
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,366
Yes?

684
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:17,056
What'd you do with that ring now?

685
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:20,378
Have earrings made from it.

686
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,960
Our Afzal --

687
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,586
Is getting engaged today, Mum...

688
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,580
Did you say anything?

689
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,586
No? Why, what is it?

690
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:51,699
I felt as if you'd said, 'Our Afzal's getting engaged today'.

691
00:38:52,446 --> 00:38:54,962
No way...

692
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:58,110
It's

693
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,190
Farah's engagement today.

694
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,240
That's sunken into your heart.

695
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,372
Go to sleep.

696
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,830
Hello?

697
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,790
Jasmine here.

698
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,280
Yes?

699
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,565
Didn't my refusal shock you?

700
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,620
I knew you'd refuse.

701
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
So, who'd you get engaged to?

702
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,240
You won't find anyone in this chaos.

703
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,850
I won't, if not with you.

704
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,170
I've fallen asleep, thinking that.

705
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,130
So, how would you exact your revenge?

706
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,691
What you consider my revenge is my wish.

707
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,880
It's beyond my control, but I wish

708
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,690
That my wedding procession come the same day her wedding procession comes to her.

709
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,032
You'd stay true to your word, won't you?

710
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:37,550
I can't guarantee that...

711
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,600
Alright, I'll guarantee it.

712
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,440
Find out the time of her engagement,

713
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,020
And come here.

714
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,630
I'll get engaged to you.

715
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
