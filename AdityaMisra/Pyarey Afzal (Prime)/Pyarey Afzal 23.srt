Ruqaiyya?

8
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,029
What happened?

9
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,866
What happened?

10
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,386
Nothing.

11
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:37,781
Nothing, really.

12
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,580
A bite is stuck in my throat.

13
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,640
When one's son is nowhere to be seen,

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,386
One can't digest the sorrow or the food, Reverend.

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,820
Nor can I, like you,

16
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,196
Defeat grief with sheer will.

17
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,346
Did you offer your prayers?

18
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,267
Did you offer your prayers?

19
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,666
Prayers?

20
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,419
It protects you from upheavals and wards off countless troubles, you blighter!

21
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:50,376
Get up!

22
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,640
Purify yourself right now,

23
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,187
And get yourselves on the prayer mat.

24
00:03:54,187 --> 00:03:56,257
Why did you slap me?

25
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:59,186
Girls like you are only brought to their senses when slapped!

26
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:00,330
Offer your prayers, quick!

27
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,206
And pray for the well-being of those

28
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,787
Whom you meet,

29
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,178
Or call.

30
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,758
What?

31
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,948
While praying today,

32
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,254
My eyes teared up.

33
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:16,020
I didn't even realise I was weeping!

34
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,907
The angels would be laughing at you right now.

35
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,951
Bother about your own -

36
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:23,100
They listen either to the clinking of your anklets or the sweet melodies of 'I've tasted blood'!

37
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,046
The poor fellows would be sitting with their ears shut!

38
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:26,822
Get up!

39
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,037
Offer your prayers,

40
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:31,272
So that it relieves the angel on your left shoulder [scribe noting evil deeds].

41
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,853
I've heard that when your type finally sits on the prayer mat,

42
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,607
One can hope for an immediate relief!

43
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,747
I don't know why my heart's saying

44
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:42,658
That you're in need of urgent relief.

45
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,628
Are you getting up,

46
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,277
Or do you want another?

47
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,908
I am.

48
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,231
Wait.

49
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,053
Just for now,

50
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:53,693
Take off these anklets for a change.

51
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,104
You don't need this background music in orison!

52
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,070
You hag!

53
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,674
Both the bullets had hit him on the leg, right?

54
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:26,721
Right...

55
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,916
Then there's nothing to worry about.

56
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,806
Right...

57
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,137
Why aren't the doctors coming out, then?

58
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:39,048
Why don't they say that everything's fine?

59
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,040
They're busy with the surgery, mun.

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,176
Right...

61
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,913
He must be talking?

62
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:44,994
No...

63
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,290
How'd he talk?

64
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,776
They'd have given him shots to put him to sleep.

65
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,777
It'll be a few hours

66
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:55,008
Before he comes to, right?
-Right...

67
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,847
Where were you?

68
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:07,200
I mean, where were you when the blighter had come to kill him?

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,156
You're at home all day,

70
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:10,877
But you'd gone for a good night's stroll tonight?

71
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:12,990
Sit down, everyone's watching...

72
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,393
What? What are they watching?

73
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:15,156
Look,

74
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,610
Don't change the topic.

75
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,737
Why don't you change the topic?

76
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:23,398
If you talk and ask about him again and again, they'd ask you who you are to him.

77
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:24,538
Hey!

78
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,349
I'm his landlady, mun!

79
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,870
Hush!

80
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,531
Sit, now.

81
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,610
Enough! C'mon.

82
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,367
Sit down.

83
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,790
... Leaves an impression with his humility, my dear.
-Just mention her name and address.

84
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,140
I'll talk to Dad.
-Love Farah for four months --

85
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,390
What's this balderdash!
-Swear on my life if I'm lying.

86
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,820
Just keep on loving me,
-That's neat.

87
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,370
You're a right emotional man.
-She's just voicing unfounded suspicions!
-The move he's played

88
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,170
Is one I'll never forgive him for!
-What's your wife's name?
-My Afzal has become the best one [Afzal] today!

89
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,010
You've just gotten up, haven't you?
-But he's a first rate fraudster.
-Just a spot of lipstick's got you stunned!

90
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,280
Then why did you take us there?
-How say you tell me -

91
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,340
How does this lipstick look?
-Farah is the one who used to write you letters, right?

92
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,810
I'd kept you as an option.
-You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

93
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,990
Shoot the bugger!
-She's not the one who used to write letters to me, Mum.

94
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,600
The job as a security guard, you know...
-And you'd leave those who love you

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,060
In Hyderabad?
-'My Afzal'

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,790
'Has become a great man'.
-Spit in my face if I lose.

97
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,160
10,000 a month, and loving Farah Ibrahim!
-Just don't do that

98
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,430
Which you would be ashamed to do.
-Proposals will line up once Wali's out of the picture, you'll see!

99
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,390
He'd kill me if he got out! What are you waiting for? Shoot the bugger!

100
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,340
Afzal!

101
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,976
I've offered my prayers.

102
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:00,216
Now, beseech the Lord

103
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,786
That he be alright.

104
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,844
Who?

105
00:10:06,262 --> 00:10:08,893
Do I have to tell you his name, now?

106
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,373
His name is etched in every breath of yours

107
00:10:11,373 --> 00:10:14,697
And courses through your veins, Lubna.

108
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,148
What happened to him?

109
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,182
There!

110
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,260
Now you know who it is!

111
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,770
Don't worry.

112
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,536
Nothing's happened to him.

113
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:24,286
I just thought

114
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,819
That may nothing happen to him.

115
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,750
I've prayed for many people,

116
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,740
But when his name came up, I thought

117
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,826
The most effective prayers for him would come from your heart.

118
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,266
What did you think?

119
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,120
And why did you think that may nothing happen to him?

120
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,686
Why are you on the rack?

121
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,837
Beseech the Lord if you've already offered you prayers

122
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:47,756
That

123
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:49,706
May the Lord will that he be fine.

124
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,616
In fact, you should keep praying for him.

125
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:53,670
I said it

126
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,900
Because it just occurred to me,

127
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,370
'Alright',

128
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,320
'Offer your prayers',

129
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,326
'Beseech the Lord'.

130
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:00,520
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

131
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,906
Good Lord!

132
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:04,331
It seems you'd tear up any moment!

133
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,029
Didn't I just say it's nothing, really?

134
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:08,700
Mum had said once,

135
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,720
'You offer prayers'

136
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,212
'And beseech the Lord'

137
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,946
'The moment you have the slightest of doubt'.

138
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,821
What is going on?

139
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,939
Nothing, really...

140
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,822
We're both scared, so, for a while,

141
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,870
We're avoiding each other's gaze.

142
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,440
Why are you scared?

143
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:35,127
The 'most excellent one' [Afzal] in the eyes of the two of you,

144
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:41,227
That rapscallion has disappeared from our sights,

145
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:46,328
And her megrims give your mother's heart a painful plight.

146
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:50,199
If milk spills from the kettle when it's being boiled,

147
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,204
Or an eye blinks,

148
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:57,630
Or this wastrel, this heart beats a tad hard,

149
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,371
She gets scared.

150
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:02,299
But you're scared too.

151
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,214
Out of respect, yes.

152
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:07,895
I've heard

153
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:11,030
'Ordinary people should be scared'

154
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,649
'When a mother gets scared'.

155
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,170
Alright, Ruqaiyya,

156
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,670
I've decided to sleep peacefully until dawn.

157
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,180
Stop telling your rosary,

158
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,850
And chant a hymn to get me sleepy.

159
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,330
He's alright now.

160
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,857
He's talking, isn't he?

161
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:54,147
He's unconscious right now, sir.

162
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,740
When he'd come to in the morning, he'd be talking, too.

163
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,506
Excuse me.

164
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,912
There! That's all it ever was. He's alright now.

165
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:03,313
Let's get going, then.

166
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:04,713
Going?

167
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,473
Call me if you need anything.

168
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,359
You'll get it.

169
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,872
C'mon, now.

170
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:13,870
Mam, how could we just leave like that? The poor man's just come to!

171
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,460
Just come!

172
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:20,344
Very bad, Mam! We should be staying here, how -- Mam, how could we just leave?
-Everyone's watching you!

173
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,050
Okay.

174
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,477
God be with ye.
-God be with ye.

175
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,359
Is Farah coming along?

176
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,146
No? Why would she?

177
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,362

Mam!

Mam! Get up, the sun's come up!

212
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,530
It's been four hours since the sun came up.

213
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,846
Aren't we going?

214
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:58,917
Where?

215
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,610
To the hospital.

216
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,006
No.

217
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,687
Why, Mam?

218
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,450
We shouldn't even have come back!

219
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,680
He's taken bullets because he fought for me!

220
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,666
He'd be thinking, now that he would've come to,

221
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,115
'Where's Jasmine'?

222
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,900
And Jasmine's enjoying herself at home here!

223
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,896
As in, 'The ones for whom I'd sacrificed myself/Were but left purifying themselves'.

224
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,271
Goodness...

225
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:31,966
Breakfast, some healthy food,

226
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,673
That's what the doctor would've told him.

227
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,204
Who'd get him that, now?

228
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,574
Babu Hamid?

229
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:40,005
That blighter would get him papar [snack] with bread and some rotten lentils!

230
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,625
You'd say it yourself, then,

231
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,760
'They got the bullets out, but couldn't get the lentils out'.

232
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,601
C'mon, now,

233
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:45,631
Have something.

234
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,271
How could I have something?

235
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:50,112
Who feels hungry in sorrow?

236
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,372
Why are you in sorrow, Jasmine?

237
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,557
Hey!

238
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,642
Fear God, Mam!

239
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,717
One feels sorrow even when one's enemies are at the hospital.

240
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:00,267
Then, he's Afzal.

241
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,138
Our own tenant.

242
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,859
Right, you sympathise with your tenant,

243
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,802
But not feel sorrow like you do!

244
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,959
Besides, I've told Babu Hamid

245
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,799
To let us know if he needs anything.

246
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,240
I'll send

247
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,620
Whatever he asks for right away.

248
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,350
I'd do my duty.

249
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,971
<i>Send</i> it?

250
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,659
As in,

251
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:26,096
You have no intentions to go to the hospital?

252
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:27,287
Won't you see,

253
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,957
Now that he's come to, how he is?

254
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:31,607
See if the poor lad's scared now,

255
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:33,556
And if he isn't, why isn't he?

256
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:35,597
He isn't scared, Jasmine.

257
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:36,958
I'm scared.

258
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,208
Right...

259
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,318
America's scared of a war between India and Pakistan.

260
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:43,888
But I know the American disposition very well!

261
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:47,651
They say they're afraid when they want to ruffle your feathers!

262
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,499
Talk about yourself, Jasmine,

263
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,330
Let America remain on the other side of the pond.

264
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,107
Whatever's up with me?

265
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:53,970
It's not as if

266
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,357
I'm dying to go to the hospital.

267
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:58,466
It's just --

268
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:01,130
My heart felt that God's watching...

269
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,677
What'd he say if he saw such aloofness?

270
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,848
I'd just say that Mam had stopped me from going.

271
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,882
May I call?

272
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,379
I'll just ask if he's come to.

273
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:23,677
He would've.

274
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:28,270
Of course he would've, Mam, but I think I'd just ask to show the Lord, if nothing else!

275
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,862
Or He'd see you!

276
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:33,233
Call him.

277
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,390
What are you looking for, now?

278
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,076
My phone.

279
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,586
There it is, by the pillow!

280
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:45,827
Before your eyes, but out of your sights.

281
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,168
Who knows where your gaze is fixed!

282
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,527
There's nothing to worry about.

283
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:06,876
Everything's okay.

284
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,227
Was I worrying?

285
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,400
No, sir,

286
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,807
You weren't worrying.

287
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,558
The people who'd come with you were worrying.

288
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:17,278
You're not going to eat anything solid before tomorrow evening.

289
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:17,920
Just milk

290
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,410
Or juice.

291
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,567
Alright?

292
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,377
Now, take care.

293
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,557
Thank you so much.

294
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,139
Why were you worried?

295
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:34,246
<i>She</i> was worried more than me.

296
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:37,036
She couldn't think of anything else.

297
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,046
If anything happened to you,

298
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:42,200
Perhaps it would've killed her to hear.

299
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,701
Her Mam practically dragged her away, or the people here would've started asking her who she was to you.

300
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,377
Jasmine?

301
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:50,552
Yes.

302
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,211
Jasmine.

303
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,846
The police came here for your statement; I've told them to come in the evening.

304
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,572
Good.

305
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:22,342
Go back to Hyderabad as soon as you get better.

306
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm honest, Afzal,

307
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,906
If you stay here,

308
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,917
And keep this enmity with Wali going on alive,

309
00:21:28,917 --> 00:21:32,236
It'd be difficult to keep yourself going on alive.

310
00:21:32,236 --> 00:21:34,490
There is no place

311
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,377
For Reverend Subhanallah's son in this city.

312
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:40,538
I can't go back now.

313
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:46,270
Send me back in a coffin when I die,

314
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,507
But I will never go to Hyderabad to live.

315
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,336
Has he come to?

316
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,251
I didn't ask.

317
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,156
Why?

318
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:07,617
I didn't call.

319
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:10,446
You didn't call?

320
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:11,782
I thought

321
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:15,062
He'd not like it if I asked how he is over the phone.

322
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:16,693
How bad, Mam, innit,

323
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:18,323
He'd fought for me,

324
00:22:18,323 --> 00:22:20,553
Taken the bullets because of me,

325
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:22,610
And if I, now, just ask him how he is over the phone

326
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,726
And shoo him away,

327
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:25,466
Wouldn't it grieve his heart?

328
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:26,977
So?

329
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,177
What should we do?

330
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,427
We should go there,

331
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:35,302
Stay with him until he gets better.

332
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:37,486
Don't even think of that, Jasmine.

333
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,096
You won't go there.

334
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,126
Why, Mam?

335
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,490
Is there anything wrong with it?

336
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,456
Yes.

337
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:44,661
It's wrong for the wrong type.

338
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,377
It's better that he come to his senses;

339
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:49,876
It'll be real bad if you came to your senses

340
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,427
Once you got there.

341
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,250
Alright,

342
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,072
Will you have a paratha [bread] or a toast with your tea?

343
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,700
It's this building here.

344
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Are you coming along?

345
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,756
Shouldn't I?

346
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,251
It'd be better if I go, though.

347
00:24:04,251 --> 00:24:06,791
He'd come along the moment you ask him.

348
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:07,740
Alright, come.

349
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,046
C'mon.

350
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,840
Dad!

351
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,590
There he is!

352
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,246
Right...

353
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,857
Excuse me...

354
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,687
Peace be upon you, sir.

355
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,726
What's your name?

356
00:25:12,726 --> 00:25:14,946
Mehmood Ahmed, sir.

357
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:19,190
Mehmood Ahmed, is there any security guard with you around here by the name of Afzal?

358
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,100
There is, sir,

359
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,510
But he's not come today.

360
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,561
He's absent without leave.

361
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,976
Alright,

362
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,510
Tell me,

363
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,646
His address,

364
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:32,536
As in, where he lives?

365
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:34,270
Your name, sir?

366
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,556
Ibrahim.

367
00:25:35,556 --> 00:25:37,596
Are you his family, sir?

368
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:38,640
Yes.

369
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,370
I'll ask and tell you, sir.

370
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,720
I've come to know he's come to,

371
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,192
And the doctor's checked and said he's alright.

372
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,587
Have something now, will you?

373
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,537
Don't be angry with me.

374
00:26:39,537 --> 00:26:42,736
Just think, you, as a girl...

375
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:45,907
If you worry so much for any lad out there,

376
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:47,747
He'd think

377
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:51,158
That you've fallen for him, right?

378
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,437
And if you have, tell me.

379
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:04,956
No?

380
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,597
Surely not, Mam!

381
00:27:06,597 --> 00:27:08,847
I knew it, too.

382
00:27:08,847 --> 00:27:10,607
I just asked you to be on the safe side

383
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:15,956
So that I can break the face of anyone who gives me a mouthful.

384
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,340
Good.

385
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,862
That's just what I'd expected from you.

386
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:27,366
Your insistence about going to the hospital got me all worked up.

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,226
But it wasn't my fault...

388
00:27:30,226 --> 00:27:33,036
Anyone seeing your condition would wonder

389
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:37,496
Why you're tormented more than the patient himself.

390
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,366
Should I get you something, now?

391
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,416
Just a cup of tea.

392
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,222
Tea? Alright.

393
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:51,396
One's got to start at something.

394
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,336
This is hardly the first time I've taken a bullet.

395
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:26,357
I'd taken one in Hyderabad, too.

396
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,282
It'd struck me here.

397
00:28:28,282 --> 00:28:30,976
Right at my heart.

398
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:35,019
Ripped right through my heart.

399
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,480
That's why, to save myself, I'd come to Karachi.

400
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,151
How did you survive if the bullet struck your heart?

401
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:43,396
The miracles of nature, Babu Hamid...

402
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,636
I'd felt I'd not survive.

403
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:46,872
Put a sock in it!

404
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:47,762
I don't believe that.

405
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:49,707
Believe it, mate.

406
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:51,900
You can believe that a bullet can kill,

407
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,377
But can't believe that I survived?

408
00:28:54,377 --> 00:28:56,325
Have your milk.

409
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:59,555
When the bullet had ripped through my heart,

410
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,065
Do you know how my heart felt?

411
00:29:02,065 --> 00:29:04,710
Just ask who had operated on me.

412
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,750
Who?

413
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,856
I had.

414
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,446
I put on each of the stitches myself.

415
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:15,690
I'd fixed it and made it a heart again,

416
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,770
But I feel that a heart that's been fixed isn't much solid.

417
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,040
It can only do so much as help a man live on.

418
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,982
Do you have the slightest shame?

419
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:31,970
Farah, let's go --

420
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,460
Hey! Get off!

421
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,501
Let me see who's the boss!

422
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:39,391
Now that your engagement plan failed,

423
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,121
You stand in my way to get even?

424
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,311
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

425
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:48,231
Want to besmirch my reputation?

426
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:51,262
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son,

427
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:57,213
So I thought you wouldn't step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

428
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,067
You'd drown in shame,

429
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:04,127
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

430
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:08,546
The police are here to note your statement.

431
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:10,550
But you'd said they'd be coming in the evening?

432
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,436
It's almost evening, mun.

433
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,666
I'm looking for him...

434
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:17,980
I have his address.

435
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,332
I got it from his office.

436
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:23,280
Grab him by the ear and put him in the car if you find him.

437
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,297
That's what I've thought,

438
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:28,676
But I'm not sure he'd agree to get in the car.

439
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,060
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

440
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:36,397
If he agreed to come, I'd come back today.
-A -- Alright, talk to Lubna.

441
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:38,282
Give her the phone.

442
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:39,950
Peace be upon you, Dad.

443
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,701
And upon you, too!

444
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:44,475
Give him a slap if he tries to hold off.

445
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,941
Or have me talk to him.

446
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:49,091
What'd you do?

447
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:51,111
Dad, just let me talk to him, will you?

448
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:53,967
I'll give him such a scolding he'd calmly get in the car with you.

449
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:58,468
Alright, I'll have him talk to you if it's necessary.

450
00:30:58,468 --> 00:31:00,300
Stop the car here.

451
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,171
Ask him.

452
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:04,097
Alright, disconnect already, now.

453
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:06,401
Please give the phone to Farah.

454
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,785
Here, talk to her.

455
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,866
Hello?
-Hello, Farah,

456
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:12,100
You're so wicked!

457
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,582
You didn't even tell me that you're going to Karachi!

458
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,006
Hello?

459
00:31:16,306 --> 00:31:18,032
Hello?

460
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,637
She's disconnected...

461
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:23,746
It got disconnected.

462
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,697
Just a minute, Mam.

463
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,670
Please, sit.

464
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,540
If I worry too much for him,

465
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,960
Who'd think I've fallen for him?

466
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,357
Everyone would,

467
00:31:55,357 --> 00:31:59,260
Because people are rather undemocratic when it comes to love.

468
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,847
They'd weep for their own love,

469
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,697
But laugh at others when they weep.

470
00:32:04,697 --> 00:32:06,482
Talk about yourself, Mam.

471
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:08,486
I don't fear people.

472
00:32:08,486 --> 00:32:11,670
You've told me that there's nothing of the sort, right?

473
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,730
You're like other people, too, Mam,

474
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,236
You just referred to love as 'the sort'...

475
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,757
Tell me what I should say.

476
00:32:18,757 --> 00:32:21,116
Say that Jasmine has fallen in love.

477
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:24,637
It's nothing 'of the sort'.

478
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,166
What it is, mun, is,

479
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,347
You're friends with Jasmine,

480
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:37,677
Which is why you're not intelligent like other Mams.

481
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:41,558
You don't even know when Jasmine's lying to you.

482
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:43,608
Step aside,

483
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:47,300
And pay attention to everything I'm saying -

484
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,870
Just like me, he's not intelligent either.

485
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,556
If I talk to him about you,

486
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:54,360
He asks, 'Are you talking about Jasmine'?

487
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,440
Ask what that means.

488
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,296
What does it mean?

489
00:32:58,296 --> 00:33:03,156
It means he doesn't know, either, that Jasmine's lying.

490
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,587
How many of them were there?

491
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:32,866
Some

492
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:34,100
Eight or nine of them?

493
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,476
Eight or nine?

494
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,481
8-9.

495
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:39,412
What?

496
00:33:39,412 --> 00:33:42,001
You were just saying 'eight or nine'.

497
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,486
Then, why are you asking 'eight or nine'?

498
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:45,797
You expect me to count

499
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:48,290
How many men are shooting at me?

500
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,840
That's not how you talk to your superiors!

501
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:54,221
Tell <i>him</i> this one, too,

502
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:57,131
'That's not how you talk to your superiors'.

503
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:58,250
Go on.

504
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,019
Who shot you?

505
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:01,752
I'd ask them.

506
00:34:01,752 --> 00:34:03,327
Whom?

507
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:05,257
As in, you'd look for

508
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:06,831
And ask those who'd come to kill you

509
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:08,602
Which of them had shot you?

510
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:09,938
Yes.

511
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,599
I know a few of them.

512
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,990
I'd get hold of them and ask who'd shot me.

513
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,051
<i>You</i>'d ask them?

514
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,756
As if <i>you</i> would!

515
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:21,490
I've told you not to talk to the officer like that.

516
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,466
Babu Hamid, take them away.

517
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,730
Teach them some manners before letting them in.

518
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,202
Do you know who I am?

519
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:33,516
Once I'm discharged from the hospital, I'll tell you who <i>I</i> am.

520
00:34:34,127 --> 00:34:36,486
Please, be kind enough to come later.

521
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:38,197
He's -- not well right now...

522
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:40,326
We have to get his statement now.

523
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:42,043
Once you get better,

524
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:44,147
I'll fix you up personally.

525
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:46,522
Babu Hamid, get them out of here.

526
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,890
Look at how you talk!

527
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,201
I'm Sub-Inspector Rafaqat Ali.

528
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,142
If you ask them about me,

529
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,247
You'd tremble at everything they'd tell you!

530
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:59,300
Babu Hamid, please ask this mad bloke to leave.

531
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,356
Please --

532
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:02,237
Please come later, alright?

533
00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:03,798
He's gotten angry now.

534
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:05,507
If you want to ask him something,

535
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:08,418
Please don't address him so roughly.

536
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,329
Fair enough...

537
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,821
Who shot Your Lordship?

538
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,961
I won't tell you his name.

539
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:18,041
It isn't proper

540
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,750
That he be in the lock-up while I'm at the hospital.

541
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,530
How would a complaint be registered, then?

542
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,360
Oh, shoot! To the Devil with the complaint.

543
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,487
I don't have the time for the police and legal affairs.

544
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:28,477
My experience tells me

545
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:30,716
That this lad's intentions aren't right.

546
00:35:30,716 --> 00:35:32,922
Your experience is absolutely right.

547
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:37,612
I, too, have a feeling that my intentions aren't right.

548
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,310
I've decided

549
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,559
To shoot

550
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,639
The man who'd shot me.

551
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,697
How intelligent are you, Jasmine?

552
00:36:35,204 --> 00:36:37,467
Tell me, will you?

553
00:36:37,467 --> 00:36:42,870
Or do you just trust your heart and think you're very intelligent?

554
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,110
Do you feel bad to hear

555
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,650
That I've fallen in love with him?

556
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,731
No, my dear.

557
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:54,060
It doesn't feel bad to know that you've fallen in love with him,

558
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,086
But it feels bad to know

559
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:58,756
That you don't know the slightest

560
00:36:58,756 --> 00:37:03,279
About the heart of the one you love.

561
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:06,190
You asked him and satisfied yourself

562
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,876
That there's no one in his life.

563
00:37:10,816 --> 00:37:15,287
One doesn't ask about those who come into and leave one's life;

564
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:19,857
One asks if there's anyone in one's heart.

565
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,830
Does Afzal live here?

566
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
