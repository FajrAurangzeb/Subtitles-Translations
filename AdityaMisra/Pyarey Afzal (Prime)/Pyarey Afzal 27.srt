1
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:13,808
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:19,059
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:24,263
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:30,527
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:36,139
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:40,779
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:32,247
What's up?

8
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:35,703
I'm watching a film.

9
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:38,280
Which one?

10
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,498
'Vaastav' ('The Reality').

11
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:41,237
'Vaastav' ('The Reality')?

12
00:02:41,237 --> 00:02:42,264
Hey!

13
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:45,224
You'd said that it's one about hooligans.

14
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,356
Yuck! What a subject.

15
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:49,449
I'd heard so about it back then.

16
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,075
I'd not watched it.

17
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,654
Now that I'm watching,

18
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,501
I get a feeling it's a rather remarkable subject.

19
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,160
You're a rather remarkable subject too, Farah!

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,031
And I think Dad's right.

21
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:03,248
You should be married to a psychiatrist.

22
00:03:03,248 --> 00:03:04,840
What?

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,436
An ordinary husband would commit suicide on the wedding night.

24
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,326
Shut up!

25
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,464
He's given you his heart.

26
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:17,729
Who?

27
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,777
The same.

28
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,058
Your psychiatrist.

29
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:24,345
The one you'd consulted to be cured.

30
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,355
Good joke.

31
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:28,061
It's no joke, Farah.

32
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,139
He's coming tonight.

33
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,369
He'd meet and talk to Dad, and take you along.

34
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:36,094
What?

35
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,715
I'd said too, when Dad asked me,

36
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:39,426
'Hmm'...

37
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,979
'Not a bad idea'.

38
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,636
Dad asked you?

39
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,682
He doesn't trust you one bit.

40
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,839
He said, 'I'd decide everything'

41
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:50,401
'And give her the news when the date of the marriage is fixed'.

42
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:52,747
'Her' as in, 'me'?

43
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,622
Yes.

44
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,533
Where's Dad?

45
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,393
Sit tight, Farah.

46
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,411
To have a daughter is no farce,

47
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:02,190
So you'd rather not teach Dad

48
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,375
That he'd be punished repeatedly for the sin of having two,

49
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,880
Nor mither him by telling him

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,924
That you've started liking 'Vaastav'.

51
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:25,207
He's coming tonight.

52
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:28,303
If Dad says yes, be a good daughter and say,

53
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,535
'As it pleases Dad'.

54
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,005
Lubna!

55
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,401
Lubna has outlived her usefulness.

56
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:37,833
When Dads start praying for their daughters' marriage,

57
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:43,379
Take it they stay awake for 4 hours and sleep for 2.

58
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,149
And this psychiatrist,

59
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,917
He's not a wastrel like Mehtab.

60
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,175
His reputation precedes him in the city.

61
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,791
He's got three clinics.

62
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,301
What else do you want?

63
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,060
That's the sticky limit!

64
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,119
Peace be upon you. I hope I'm on time.
-Peace be upon you.

65
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,434
Just in time, yes.

66
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:28,697
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace. May you live long.

67
00:05:28,697 --> 00:05:29,794
Come, Monsieur le Docteur.

68
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,061
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

69
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:33,009
Sir,

70
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,889
Please don't address me as 'Monsieur le Docteur'; I get the feeling I'm visiting a chronic patient.

71
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,229
Come.
-Right.

72
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,799
Farah!

73
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,439
Farah, the chap's here!

74
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,236
I mean, the good man's here.

75
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:50,081
Farah?

76
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,785
Where are you, Farah?

77
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,940
Hey!

78
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:21,701
You're so predictable.

79
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,857
I knew it,

80
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:24,981
You'd be here if not in your room!

81
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,776
He's here

82
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:30,308
And looking so handsome!

83
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:32,950
Just the thought of a psychiatrist

84
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,450
Gives me the chills!

85
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,502
I'm sure it gives him the chills, too,

86
00:06:37,502 --> 00:06:40,590
Marrying one's patient is no trifle either.

87
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,203
But some people are just naturally a tad adventurous!

88
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:46,669
What be my orders?

89
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:47,732
Do I change

90
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,031
And go before him?

91
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,486
Should I say, 'Yes'?

92
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:52,358
But have Dad promise, then,

93
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,673
That he'd sleep for all 6 hours.

94
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:57,073
You agreed!

95
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,089
Wait, Lubna!

96
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:04,078
I'm not as predictable as you folks think I am.

97
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:05,151
That's it.

98
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,591
That's why they're marrying you off to a psychiatrist!

99
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:12,026
Psychiatrists aren't spectacularly predictable either!

100
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:31,142
Your parents are in Yorkshire, aren't they?
-That's right.

101
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:33,064
When would they be coming?

102
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:35,985
In a week or so?

103
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:42,418
Did you send them a picture?

104
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,088
I did back then itself.

105
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:48,183
They just keep looking at it.

106
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,663
Maw was saying,

107
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:53,146
'However did you get such a bonnie lass'?

108
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:54,293
What did you say, then?

109
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:56,146
However did you get her?

110
00:07:56,146 --> 00:08:01,039
I said, 'It's because I'm a psychiatrist'.

111
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,414
In the beginning, both of them

112
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,726
Were against my decision to become a psychiatrist.

113
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,646
'In Pakistan', says Dad,

114
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:11,647
'A psychiatrist is considered no more worthy than an aliéniste'.

115
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:13,240
Farah says the same!

116
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,726
Except that she says it to my face.

117
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,579
May I come in?

118
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,452
Yes.

119
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,723
We're done talking.

120
00:08:22,876 --> 00:08:23,579
She's...

121
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,079
Left her room and is sitting on the swing.

122
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:33,051
Would you allow me to meet her?

123
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:35,198
Sure, my dear. Go.

124
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,168
Where's the swing?

125
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,771
On the terrace.

126
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:41,369
It must be blustery up there.

127
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:42,144
Yes.

128
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:43,456
It is.

129
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,410
Fresh air, and a lot of it does the trick for such patients.

130
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,224
Now --

131
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,096
Look, my dear,

132
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,603
Don't even call her a patient by mistake.

133
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:52,775
I'm saying this before you,

134
00:08:52,775 --> 00:08:56,055
I can't even think of saying this before her.

135
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,113
Shall we go up to the terrace?

136
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,800
Sure.

137
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:01,378
Excuse me.

138
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:03,857
Listen, my dear.

139
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,107
If she says something foul,

140
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:08,920
Don't get angry.

141
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,122
Psychiatrists never

142
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:12,431
Get angry,

143
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,708
Aunt.

144
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:44,978
May I come in?

145
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:47,495
Who is it?

146
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:49,557
Sibtain.

147
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,196
Sibtain who?

148
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:55,575
Your psychiatrist.

149
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,808
I mean, the one who's a psychiatrist by profession.

150
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,974
They've sent the blighter upstairs!

151
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:01,695
Lubna!

152
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:05,115
She left me here and went.

153
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:07,584
Come.

154
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:29,229
You're the type to babble your heart out loud.

155
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,853
What do you mean?

156
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:35,072
I heard it hen you said 'blighter'.

157
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,187
Oops...

158
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:37,462
I -- I'm sorry...

159
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,448
No, no -- It's okay.

160
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,934
It happens often in my profession.

161
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,681
Once,

162
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:43,854
In fact,

163
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:48,055
A patient abused my mother and my sister,

164
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:49,166
But I said,

165
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,541
'No problem'.

166
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,671
'It's okay'.

167
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:54,780
Accursed be such a profession!

168
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,338
Initially, my parents used to say the same.

169
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,733
But when they saw

170
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:03,853
The same patients, after being cured, bless my mother and sister from the depths of their hearts, they were happy with it, too.

171
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,166
You're still thinking of me as your patient?

172
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,009
No, no -- Not at all.

173
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:09,779
The thing is,

174
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,856
I spend so much time at my clinic

175
00:11:11,856 --> 00:11:14,511
That it's become a habit, so to speak.

176
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:17,654
In fact, even when one of the mannies says something like a gowk,

177
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:19,510
I say,

178
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,968
'Mate',

179
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,779
'You look right like a patient'.

180
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:25,779
Why have you come up here?

181
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:26,931
I mean --

182
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,964
When Mum and Dad approve of this match,

183
00:11:28,964 --> 00:11:30,987
Why this formality?

184
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,699
That's an intelligent question.

185
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,387
Wait!

186
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:38,462
Answer her later.

187
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,120
The thing is,

188
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,904
There's no place to sit on the terrace except the swing, so I thought I'd give you this chair.

189
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,058
Thank you.

190
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:45,995
You're welcome.

191
00:11:45,995 --> 00:11:48,745
Please, carry on.

192
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:52,078
She is so sweet!

193
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,549
Then marry her, will you?

194
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,781
Why are you thinking about me?

195
00:11:56,781 --> 00:11:57,982
The thing is,

196
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:00,533
Once you've thought about someone in love,

197
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,249
You've thought just about the one.
-Oh?

198
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,155
So psychiatrists love too?

199
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:05,874
Hey!

200
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,365
Why are you making a trifle of a psychiatrist?

201
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,379
We're the only ones who love genuinely.

202
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,863
The others just have affairs!

203
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,060
Ohh...

204
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,246
Oh, as in?

205
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,638
Pray tell,

206
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:20,108
I mean, when a girl says 'Ohh' to words of love,

207
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,842
What does it mean?

208
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,265
May I?

209
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:25,987
Please.

210
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:28,438
It means

211
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:32,233
'As it pleases Maw and Paw'.

212
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,045
Get up.

213
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:37,606
I said get up!

214
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:42,308
Come with me!

215
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:45,632
Look down there!

216
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,803
I can't look down.

217
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:47,488
I --

218
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:48,786
I have acrophobia.

219
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,348
I have acrophobia too!

220
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,131
But I'd rather jump from here and die

221
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:55,777
Than marry you!

222
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,650
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:16,462
Perhaps my words hurt you too much.

224
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,949
But I can't help it.

225
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,650
It's okay.

226
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,392
Then go downstairs this instant,

227
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:32,916
And -- Say to Dad,

228
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,183
'I can't marry a girl so depraved as Farah'!

229
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,297
No.

230
00:13:37,297 --> 00:13:40,029
Under no circumstance am I rejecting this marriage.

231
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:41,522
Why can't you?

232
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,288
It'd kill my parents' emotions.

233
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:48,177
With such difficulty, they've found a daughter-in-law who's liked by both the parties.

234
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:49,415
Both the parties?

235
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,491
My parents and I are two separate parties.

236
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:56,505
Usually, it's that the girl they like is one I don't lik --
-And the one you like is one they don't.

237
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,340
Not at all.

238
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,756
Earlier, I had no interest in girls at all.

239
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,114
I thought of them as patients.

240
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,278
Every girl

241
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:07,659
Loves one and gets married off to another.

242
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:12,009
And the greatest irony is that they live life happily after marriage.

243
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,819
But this time,

244
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,943
It's different.

245
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,919
I've found one

246
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,085
Who gets unhinged

247
00:14:21,085 --> 00:14:25,633
At the very thought of a different lad.

248
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:26,401
It's

249
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:30,540
Time for me to go to my clinic; my patients would be waiting.

250
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,616
See you.

251
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:48,015
<i>If only one would look, begging for mercy,</i>

252
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:56,060
<i>If only one would look, begging for mercy,</i>

253
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,936
<i>If love is true,</i>

254
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,185
<i>If love is true,</i>

255
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:07,865
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

256
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:11,141
<i>If love is true,</i>

257
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:15,749
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

258
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:19,075
<i>If love is true,</i>

259
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:24,075
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

260
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:32,852
<i>If love is true,</i>

261
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:37,610
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

262
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,728
<i>If love is true,</i>

263
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:45,524
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

264
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:51,196
It'll work if you come everyday for seven days.

265
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,613
I will, Father.

266
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:02,039
I'll come here all my life if it works for me.

267
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,238
Show such devotion to Him, too.

268
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:07,834
Offer your prayers,

269
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,363
Bow to Him.

270
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,806
Just so much would delight him.

271
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:15,803
I will, Father.

272
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:21,208
Wipe your tears, then.

273
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,801
One weeps and begs from Him,

274
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:26,050
And not begs and weeps.

275
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,129
Go.

276
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:28,329
Right, Afzal, matey,

277
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,731
The area from here to here is yours.

278
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:34,356
And the one from here to here,

279
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,793
Except this 10 kilometre stretch in-between,

280
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,184
The next 10 kilometre stretch is yours.

281
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:43,703
Why have you left the 10 kilometre stretch in the middle?

282
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:46,343
That's my area, matey.

283
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,093
Oh...

284
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,305
And beyond that?

285
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:52,304
Beyond that reign the others.

286
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:57,574
Fanne Khan, Rehmat Baloch, Gullu Qainchi and the others.

287
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,182
By the way,

288
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,651
Najju,

289
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,245
How many murders have you committed?

290
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:05,358
16.

291
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,806
The one just now, though,

292
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,107
That lucky wretch escaped alive.

293
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,357
And how many out of these 16

294
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:13,821
Did you feel pity for, as you killed them?

295
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:17,149
There ain't room for pity in this profession, matey.

296
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:20,543
Alright; you must know how many of them were innocent?

297
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:24,171
4 of them were completely innocent.

298
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:30,580
Why are you asking this, matey?

299
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,753
Just asking.

300
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:34,158
The thing is,

301
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:37,678
I think a tad differently.

302
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,783
I think

303
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:41,472
One should not kill the innocent.

304
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,927
In this profession, matey,

305
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:48,743
If you show so much as an ounce of pity, you'd regret it the next day.

306
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:52,907
There ain't a next day in our lives, Najju, matey!

307
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,225
To sleep is to die,

308
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:57,533
To wake up again is to live another day.

309
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,205
That's right, matey.

310
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,549
My father used to say

311
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:07,488
That an outlaw's life is only up to his thirties.

312
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:11,897
Either he no longer remains an outlaw after his thirties,

313
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:15,738
Or he no longer remains alive.

314
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,344
It's two.

315
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,002
I'll get going, matey.

316
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:24,928
Bye.

317
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:28,985
Speaking of which, Najju, matey,

318
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:29,900
Yes, matey?

319
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,494
How old are you?

320
00:20:32,494 --> 00:20:35,151
In or past your thirties?

321
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,465
Past, matey.

322
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:47,151
Say goodbye, then.

323
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:49,401
Goodbye.

324
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:40,088
Najju would've served us well.

325
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,492
So he would've, mate,

326
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,211
But he only served his evil intentions.

327
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:46,121
And then,

328
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:49,120
He'd killed four people who were innocent.

329
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,102
Why are you distressed?

330
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:56,352
There is cause for me to be distressed.

331
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:59,717
I saw the map of the city today.

332
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:03,633
Not a corner of the city is under the Government's writ.

333
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:07,196
It's been cut up into pieces, a hoodlum reigning over each.

334
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:10,044
Another hoodlum takes over the moment one's reign ends.

335
00:23:10,044 --> 00:23:12,042
This traffic signal

336
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:14,561
Is a traffic signal only for the public.

337
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,524
It's a border for the ruffians.

338
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:19,558
Kingdoms change from one signal to another,

339
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,233
As does the ruffian's name.

340
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:24,305
I can't talk to Dad,

341
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:28,524
Or I'd show him the map and tell him that the faithful are losing,

342
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:32,976
And the sinners are reigning supreme.

343
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:37,075
I've ordered sleeping pills for you.

344
00:23:37,075 --> 00:23:41,494
There's one by the jug of water in your room.

345
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:43,615
5 mg?

346
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,680
5 mg.

347
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:00,008
I long to go to Hyderabad, mate.

348
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:03,554
I miss those alleys a lot

349
00:24:03,554 --> 00:24:05,805
That I, complete with trousers, shirt and tie,

350
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:11,646
With a lunch box from Arifa in my hands, would walk through on my way to the bus stop.

351
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:17,647
That kind of walking had its own kind of romance, Babloo.

352
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:19,035
Look, Afzal,

353
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,728
It's not too late yet.

354
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,914
Hyderabad awaits you to this day.

355
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:26,741
Just decide on it and get out of here.

356
00:24:26,741 --> 00:24:31,568
I can't get out of here even if I decided on it.

357
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,179
I feel

358
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:34,577
I'm here for this purpose.

359
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:37,398
What purpose?

360
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:43,193
To murder those who kill 16 something.

361
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:47,023
I swear by God, until I'm past my thirties,

362
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:52,100
I'll hunt down and kill each of these buggers.

363
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,520
Farah?

364
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:21,046
I was yearning to meet you since last night,

365
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,356
So came here first thing in the morning.

366
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:25,699
Come in.

367
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:46,584
Mum and Dad are alright, aren't they?

368
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,536
Yes.

369
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:51,976
Uncle Reverend must be at home?

370
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:55,004
These days, he is at home.

371
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,178
Well, at least there's the satisfaction

372
00:26:57,178 --> 00:26:58,492
That he's happy

373
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,943
Wherever he is.

374
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:05,749
Come here.

375
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,403
Let me greet Aunt first.

376
00:27:08,403 --> 00:27:09,374
Mum!

377
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:13,019
Farah sends her greetings.

378
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,064
And upon you, peace.

379
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:24,398
There's nothing to be shocked, really.

380
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,195
Seeing Mum, one feels like solacing her...

381
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,649
But she says,

382
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,978
'Beware'!

383
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:36,023
'Nobody shall comfort or solace me'!

384
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:40,842
How's Lubna?

385
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,372
She keeps sorrow at an arm's length,

386
00:27:42,372 --> 00:27:44,091
And is thus happy.

387
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:49,724
She doesn't even know that I've come here to meet you.

388
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,487
Got any wind about him, any news?

389
00:27:55,487 --> 00:27:59,216
Got word from someone about what he's been doing?

390
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:02,874
One needn't listen or search for news about him.

391
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:06,109
One gets to see his photograph in one newspaper or another,

392
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:10,787
And with it, a chronicle of his craft.

393
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,081
Yesterday,

394
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:17,659
He's killed a hoodlum by the name of Najju.

395
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,784
Hey!

396
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,706
You're affrighted!

397
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:29,596
Dad's affrighted, too.

398
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:36,983
But he's affrighted that people would start fearing him.

399
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,844
Didn't I always say

400
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,907
That he'd end up in bad company if he went to Karachi?

401
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:44,940
That's what happened, innit?

402
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:46,778
Leave him.

403
00:28:46,778 --> 00:28:47,734
Tell me,

404
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:48,605
What'll you have?

405
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:50,293
Tea or coffee?

406
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,252
He may still be reformed, Arifa.

407
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,498
No...

408
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:58,074
It's no good reforming those who commit murders.

409
00:28:58,074 --> 00:29:03,015
They either go to jail, or to the gallows.

410
00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:07,248
Dad closed his eyes tightly when he heard about his first murder.

411
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:10,559
Then, regaining control, he said,

412
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,929
'We won't be getting him back, Arifa',

413
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:19,020
'We'd only get the news about him one day'.

414
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,128
You didn't tell me -

415
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,472
Would you rather have tea or coffee?

416
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,429
How easily you say

417
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,814
Such fatal words!

418
00:29:29,814 --> 00:29:32,318
I'm the sister of a fabled Bhai [= brother, hoodlum];

419
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:35,413
His fame resounds throughout Karachi.

420
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:40,102
Now, I'd say such things with fearless audacity.

421
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,219
Have some tea.

422
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,488
N -- No.

423
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,983
I won't be able to drink it.

424
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:04,319
Try and find the Farah who used to write him letters somehow.

425
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,227
She can stop him.

426
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,521
You think I'm kidding?

427
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,320
No.

428
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm saying it myself,

429
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,960
If I chance upon that lassie!

430
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,259
What would you say to her if you chanced upon her?

431
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,557
What is there to say, really?

432
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:26,491
I'd explain it to her and say, 'Go',

433
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,192
'You're better off marrying someone better'!

434
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:32,522
'Start a new life, you wee lassie'.

435
00:30:34,013 --> 00:30:38,380
No heartfelt words can reach where he stands now.

436
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,756
How would her letters reach him?

437
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:49,047
And may God will that she'd have been married off when I next see her,

438
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,670
Going somewhere with her husband...

439
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:58,387
I wouldn't be able to recognise her even if I did.

440
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,880
I'm getting married.

441
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,431
To whom?

442
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:12,199
Dad's

443
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:14,195
Found a psychiatrist.

444
00:31:14,195 --> 00:31:17,173
He used to think I needed to see one,

445
00:31:17,173 --> 00:31:18,762
So I went to him.

446
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:19,837
I found out

447
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:24,178
It was he who needed to see me.

448
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,470
Blessed be you.

449
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,648
At least show some of that delight.

450
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:34,920
If he's Dad's choice, he must be a good man.

451
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,171
Yes...

452
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,625
I've seen it, too.

453
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:44,327
You always end up choosing a dreadful one yourself.

454
00:31:45,232 --> 00:31:48,500
When are you getting married?

455
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,188
I don't know.

456
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:51,864
Judging by Dad's intentions, though,

457
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,673
It won't be too long.

458
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:57,485
Don't invite Mum and Dad.

459
00:31:57,485 --> 00:32:01,872
Call me and I'll come.

460
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:13,759
Shall I take my leave, then?

461
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,605
You'd come just to tell me about your marriage?

462
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:18,947
Yes.

463
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:27,898
This way.

464
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:31,974
Right, this way.

465
00:32:31,974 --> 00:32:35,281
I'm leaving, Aunt.

466
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,587
She must have fallen asleep.

467
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,835
She takes a pill at night,

468
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:45,804
And dozes off in the morning.

469
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,762
I think that's right, what you said.

470
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:07,968
If you chance upon the Farah who wrote him letters,

471
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:10,041
Tell her to get married, too.

472
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:14,276
Settle with her husband and start a merry life.

473
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:18,437
He's not coming back.

474
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,025
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

475
00:34:02,025 --> 00:34:03,887
Where's Afzal Bhai?
-Please, sit.

476
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:06,089
He's coming.

477
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,504
Tea or coffee?

478
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:17,581
Coffee.

479
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,540
Peace be upon you.

480
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,169
And upon you, peace.

481
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:34,447
How are you?

482
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,368
Fine.

483
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,978
Please, sit.

484
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:39,011
Thank you.

485
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:41,511
Thank you, Monsieur.

486
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,250
I've been supporting the police for two months,

487
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,250
But I don't trust you.
-Look, Monsieur,

488
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,630
The police won't sign any agreement with you

489
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,018
To show their trust.

490
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:58,702
You've supported the police,

491
00:34:58,702 --> 00:35:00,031
Which is why, in these two months,

492
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,608
Not one of the bobbies

493
00:35:01,608 --> 00:35:03,811
Has so much as glanced his eye at you.

494
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,016
But I've not been told who gives me the money,

495
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:09,967
And why are my tantrums being borne up with?

496
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:12,706
You will never find out about the money,

497
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:16,110
But let me tell you why your tantrums are being borne up with.

498
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,344
The target it costs

499
00:35:18,344 --> 00:35:19,313
The police

500
00:35:19,313 --> 00:35:21,271
And the Government

501
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:23,379
Millions to get to,

502
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:26,801
And yet earns them the courts' barbs,

503
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:29,827
You get to that target in a few hundreds of thousands.

504
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:30,818
So actually,

505
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,624
Less is being spent,

506
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:36,109
And more is being saved.

507
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:38,004
So the Government is paying the money.

508
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:41,812
I'd said you'd never find out about that.

509
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:45,844
Alright, then, you'd have to answer my second question.

510
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,468
Ask away.

511
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:49,439
How long are you keeping me alive?

512
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:53,299
As long as you want to.

513
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:54,705
A lie.

514
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:57,245
If you won't enter politics,

515
00:35:57,245 --> 00:36:00,027
At the end of the road, you'll be presented with two options.

516
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:02,261
And in the second option, you'll be asked

517
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,152
To take your money,

518
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:05,464
And leave the country.

519
00:36:05,464 --> 00:36:07,653
And what will they ask of me in the first option?

520
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:12,141
They'll say, 'Say your prayers'.

521
00:36:14,223 --> 00:36:17,317
I'm the son of Reverend Subhanallah.

522
00:36:17,317 --> 00:36:21,703
I routinely say my prayers.

523
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:14,127
What'll they do if I enter politics?

524
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:22,174
They won't even give you so much respite as to say your prayers.

525
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,824
The thing is, you're new in this trade,

526
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:28,962
And you're half a Reverend yourself, at that,

527
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:31,291
Thus, it'll take you a while to find out

528
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:35,369
That everyone's a hoodlum in politics.

529
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:40,117
Politics has changed greatly, Monsieur.

530
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:46,982
Politicians don't kill each other now;

531
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:50,418
They kill each other's henchmen.

532
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:54,133
Although it makes the job easy for the police,

533
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,883
It doesn't benefit the Government.

534
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:59,898
If the riches of the Treasury

535
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:02,477
Fall into the hands of hoodlums,

536
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,821
New hooligans are brought up

537
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,196
To snatch them back.

538
00:38:07,196 --> 00:38:09,040
So, if one hooligan dies,

539
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,149
You get news that two have replaced him.

540
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,589
Do you take bribes?

541
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,602
One's got to, Monsieur.

542
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:25,243
Otherwise, for so much as sitting the wrong way on my chair,

543
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,796
Saluting a few moments late,

544
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,855
Or firing two additional bullets,

545
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,015
I could be inculpated.

546
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:33,090
But I swear, Monsieur,

547
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:37,555
I don't disgrace the uniform.

548
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:40,243
Have you brought the money?

549
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,309
Yes.

550
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,962
It's in the car.

551
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:45,962
Alright, I'll not ask for too much information.

552
00:38:45,962 --> 00:38:48,744
But the next time you send me a dossier on a ruffian,

553
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:55,102
Please do write in the footnote the name of the one who's been nurturing him.

554
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:56,824
I'm sorry, Afzal Bhai,

555
00:38:56,824 --> 00:38:58,947
The other hoodlums are being nurtured

556
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:04,383
In much the same way someone's nurturing you.

557
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,227
Should you get furious,

558
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:12,259
This city will forever remain a hostage held by hooligans.

559
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,902
And should you refuse,

560
00:39:14,902 --> 00:39:18,728
You'd be asked to say your prayers.

561
00:39:18,728 --> 00:39:20,199
I know

562
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,306
That you routinely say your prayers.

563
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:26,829
But when they say, 'Say your prayers',

564
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:33,438
It means you'll be saying your prayers for the last time.

565
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,214
Ask someone

566
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:38,556
To get the bag from the car.

567
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,513
We'll meet again.

568
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
