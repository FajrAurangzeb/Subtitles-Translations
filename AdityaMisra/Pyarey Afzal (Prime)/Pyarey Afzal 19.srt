1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,860
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,109
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,220
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,620
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,150
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,910
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,340
Come.

8
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,721
I've seen you.

9
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,677
Just ask quietly

10
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:00,841
Where I'd gone and who I've met.

11
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,756
Hey!

12
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,040
Who have you met?

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,051
As if you don't know at all!

14
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,460
I swear, Farah, I don't.

15
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,721
I'd gone to Arifa's place.

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,812
Arifa's place?

17
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:14,059
Yes.

18
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,597
I thought I'd sit with her for a while,

19
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:18,596
Comfort her.

20
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,717
So, could you comfort her?
-I tried the best I could.

21
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:25,197
The Lord will reward you for this.

22
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,471
You don't even think

23
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,993
Where you're going when going to comfort them.

24
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,230
But she's very hard-hearted.

25
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,742
She isn't particularly grieved that her brother's left them.

26
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,670
So she didn't give you the photograph?

27
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,956
Photograph?

28
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:46,096
I'd dropped that idea long ago.

29
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,200
So, what did you talk about?

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,896
We

31
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:53,786
Were talking about the Farah who writes him letters.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,046
Lubna, I think

33
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,590
He's eloped with her.

34
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,772
And you said this to Arifa, too?

35
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,908
I'm just telling you my guess.

36
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,943
And such wayward lasses

37
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,620
Are there the moment one calls them.

38
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,060
He'd have said, 'Come',

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,140
'Now's the chance'.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,782
'Let's steal away together'!

41
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,292
She'd be living with him, now,

42
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,946
Without getting married.

43
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:22,926
But know what,

44
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:25,696
A tragic end awaits her kind!

45
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,086
Their end may be happy, too.

46
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,696
Perhaps the two of them have gotten married?

47
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,316
You're right.

48
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,024
I didn't even think of that.

49
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,817
And he's the son of a Reverend.

50
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:44,247
He'd know every nuptial rite!

51
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,941
Yes!

52
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:50,721
I'm beginning to understand what Arifa said now!

53
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:52,655
What did she say?

54
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:55,436
She said, 'He's left Hyderabad for Karachi'.

55
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:57,566
'He'd be back when he's become something'.

56
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:58,707
The blighter!

57
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,759
He'll come back a father!

58
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,416
Mam!

59
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,297
Mam!

60
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:54,180
Get up.

61
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,400
Wali's here.

62
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,750
Wali?

63
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,527
Where is he?

64
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,997
Open the door,

65
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,856
Or he'll create a scene before everyone.

66
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,610
At ease.

67
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,010
It's Jasmine's cousin.

68
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,337
He's the loafer type.

69
00:05:32,337 --> 00:05:35,560
He always rings the bell like that.

70
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,060
Everyone in the family's got issues!

71
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,652
But Jasmine's nice, boyo.

72
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,679
What is it?

73
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,140
Why are you here?

74
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,326
Jeez, Modryb...

75
00:06:03,326 --> 00:06:06,550
You'd ask your nai why he's here?

76
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,741
I'd said I'd be here on the 25th,

77
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,453
And it's the 25th today.

78
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,860
And I'd said back then that you don't need to come here.

79
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,100
What about you, Modryb, you say anything.

80
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,006
Step aside, will you?

81
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:20,770
A quarrel between a Modryb and her nai doesn't look very nice.

82
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,097
We'll talk inside.

83
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,886
You can't come inside.

84
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:34,846
I'll have to make my way in if you stop me.

85
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:36,636
You might even get injured, Modryb.

86
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:38,709
Muster all your courage, boyo.

87
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:41,636
And try your Modryb's, too!

88
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,607
Babu Hamid!

89
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,677
Babu Hamid!

90
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,177
Hey!

91
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:55,858
She's crying for help!

92
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:57,337
Sit tight.

93
00:06:57,337 --> 00:06:59,721
Let her cry if she does.

94
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,851
Such an effete man!

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,941
Babu Hamid!

96
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,747
Babu Hamid!

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,644
Hey!

98
00:07:18,644 --> 00:07:20,527
Hey -- Boyo -- Afzal!

99
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,128
Don't do it, Modryb,

100
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,228
I'm getting angry.

101
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,068
Babu Hamid!

102
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,980
Alright.

103
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,439
Call him one more time.

104
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,032
If he comes, alright.

105
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,846
Otherwise, open the door yourself, Modryb.

106
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,477
What is going on?

107
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,467
Just --

108
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:43,450
I'm joking around with me Modryb.

109
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,369
Who are you?

110
00:07:45,613 --> 00:07:46,919
Afzal.

111
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm her tenant.

112
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,739
But she was calling Babu Hamid, wasn't she?

113
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,660
Where's the bugger?

114
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,476
Look,

115
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:56,163
Don't use foul words.

116
00:07:56,163 --> 00:08:00,716
It isn't proper to misbehave at your Aunt's doorstep.

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,890
You've just gotten up, haven't you?

118
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,347
Go back to sleep,

119
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:08,157
Or I'll put you to sleep right here.

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,317
What is your name?

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,696
Answer me, sir.

122
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:22,317
Wali --

123
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:24,767
His name's Wali.

124
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:30,608
My Dad says it's not good to pick a fight,

125
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:36,049
But my heart says it's no good to desert a fight once it's started either.

126
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,180
This is your Aunt's house,

127
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,872
But you don't even enter your Dad's house without permission.

128
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:52,733
You're new here and I think nobody's told you about me.

129
00:08:53,223 --> 00:08:54,553
Well,

130
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:56,263
Never mind.

131
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,883
I'll get going.

132
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:01,632
But don't take this meeting as my introduction.

133
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:06,593
Next time, I'll show you who this bugger called Wali really is.

134
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,907
Okay, Modryb.

135
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,216
I'll get going.

136
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:14,467
Take care of her.

137
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:17,382
I'll be dropping by any day this time.

138
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,003
God be with ye.

139
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,396
Thank you very much, my dear.

140
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,617
He didn't come in?

141
00:10:27,617 --> 00:10:29,778
Sent the scoundrel away.

142
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:31,878
You sent him away and he left?

143
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,189
Ain't buying that, Mam...

144
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,960
He isn't going away like that.

145
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,790
Afzal sent him away.

146
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,330
He understood it in a moment when he said it.

147
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,409
What do you mean?

148
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,930
He scared him away

149
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,490
Like Babu Hamid had?

150
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,741
Yes.

151
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,951
Then the poor soul's dead.

152
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:47,900
Don't you remember

153
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,621
What he did to Babu Hamid?

154
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,776
I do.

155
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,952
But everyone should remember

156
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,060
It's only a man's duty to save a girl.

157
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,946
Whether the man's one's own or an outsider.

158
00:10:57,946 --> 00:11:00,130
Whose duty, then, is it to save him?

159
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,430
The blighter would have ten men with him when he'd be back.

160
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,391
They'd beat him black and blue.

161
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,071
The poor man's our tenant, Mam,

162
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,061
Not our guardian.

163
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,711
In fact, he's not even properly our tenant.

164
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,866
What did he say as he left?

165
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:19,846
He said,

166
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,047
'I'll introduce myself when I come back'.

167
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:24,750
It's the same, then, isn't it?

168
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,090
He said one day, 'I break legs for an introduction'!

169
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,946
Oh God!

170
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:33,312
I'll tell him to vanish from here.
-Hey!

171
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,930
Hey! Listen!

172
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,570
Do you see this wound?

173
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,896
Look at this one, too.

174
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,911
The bugger struck me with a 2 kilo pistol.

175
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:48,641
It still hurts here.

176
00:11:49,051 --> 00:11:50,297
Come on.

177
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:55,133
Gather all your things and make yourself scarce within 15 minutes.

178
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:56,663
Go where?

179
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:58,442
And why?

180
00:11:58,442 --> 00:11:59,928
Haven't I paid the rent?

181
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,209
You have,

182
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:03,149
But Wali is going to pay you back

183
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:06,408
What you've given him with a tenfold interest!

184
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:06,999
When?

185
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:09,050
What do you mean, 'When'?

186
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,846
At least tell him not to come.

187
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:13,487
I'm the son of a priest.

188
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:14,973
I don't charge interest.

189
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:17,983
Do you even know what she's talking about?

190
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:18,720
Yes --

191
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,546
She's talking about the interest, mate.

192
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:21,362
I've told her

193
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:22,862
I'm not taking any.

194
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:25,358
They'll be bringing some 10 ruffians for interest,

195
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,808
They'd clobber your face until it's beyond recognition,

196
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,309
And that Wali will smite your legs for the sin of grabbing his collar.

197
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:33,838
At the very least.

198
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,572
Does he not have legs?

199
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:37,439
What do you mean?

200
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:39,460
It's clear what that means, Babu, mate.

201
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,176
An eye for an eye,

202
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:42,477
And a leg for a leg.

203
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,356
What --

204
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,157
You want to be a hero?

205
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:48,587
You'd fight 10 men all by yourself?

206
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,947
He even carries a pistol!

207
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,987
That's odd, mate.

208
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,518
Dad wanted me to fear God,

209
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:59,959
And you want me to fear His men?

210
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,824
For God's sak --
-Don't swear by God.

211
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,987
I know, too, that he'll be coming.

212
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,541
We'll see when he comes

213
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,797
How powerful ten ruffians can be.

214
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:10,928
Look,

215
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,150
Your have pretty face just like me,

216
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,649
But he only likes women with pretty faces,

217
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,209
He doesn't like men with pretty faces.

218
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:20,680
He'll mangle that face of yours.

219
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,380
Why

220
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,941
Don't you wait for him quietly?

221
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,556
Let him come.

222
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,396
Let him show what he can do.

223
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:30,696
I'm waiting for him, too,

224
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:34,137
And I don't like to wait.

225
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:35,970
This lad's going to die, Babu Hamid,

226
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,286
And get you killed too.

227
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,590
I'm going to get you breakfast.

228
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,496
Eat whatever you have for breakfast and lunch as if it's the last thing you'll ever have

229
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:51,246
For breakfast or lunch.

230
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,167
What does she think Wali is?

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,526
Who knows what <i>you</i> think Wali is.

232
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,500
He's not going.

233
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,316
The lad's proper manly, Jasmine.

234
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,290
I saw his courage in the morning.

235
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,776
One of these days,

236
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,197
You'll see the 'proper manly' lad scurrying like a rat.

237
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,660
He won't even be able to eat if he got hurt around the mouth.

238
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,664
We have the things to make soup, right?

239
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,076
Is he asking for soup?

240
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,500
He isn't right now, Mum,

241
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,526
But he will, in a few days.

242
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:37,076
He'll only have soup for a week or two,

243
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,207
And if Babu Hamid is spared, he'll be having the bread.

244
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:41,596
He didn't feel the sligtest of fear?

245
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,366
Not at all.

246
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,236
And Babu Hamid?

247
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:48,076
Didn't he tell, either, what kind of a tyrant Wali is?

248
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:49,267
He did.

249
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,286
The poor man was even showing his wounds,

250
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:53,897
And this lad was laughing.

251
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:58,517
What's this long 'hmm' about?

252
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:02,251
Thus beat the drums of war, O daughter of Fortune!

253
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:05,342
A ferocious battle shall mark the days to come,

254
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:07,657
As the forces of the righteous and the sinful shall clash,

255
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,827
And the sinful shall be disgraced.

256
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,698
What forces will clash?

257
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:13,540
Don't think of a single man as a force.

258
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,261
The ten or so blokes will crush him together.
-I've seen his eyes.

259
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,426
They're not the kind that would accept defeat.

260
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,026
Peace be upon you.

261
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,806
Sit.

262
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,517
That's what I'd come to say.

263
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:16,356
Mum had advised me,

264
00:16:16,356 --> 00:16:20,215
'Go and tell Arifa to recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties]'.

265
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,293
Where's Lubna gone?

266
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,086
To Arifa's.

267
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:45,570
It just occurred to me that they should recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties].

268
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,090
If they do, you should go too.

269
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,577
One should always do one's part in good deeds.

270
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:53,168
She could've just called...

271
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,624
Arifa's asked her not to call.

272
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,695
She says,

273
00:16:56,695 --> 00:17:00,526
'When the phone rings, it feels as if Afzal's calling'.

274
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:02,775
'So, it's better that you don't call'.

275
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,940
'A ray of hope'

276
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,276
'Shines bright when the bell rings'.

277
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:10,246
Why has Afzal suddenly become so important to us?

278
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,606
Mum!

279
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,557
I'm asking you.

280
00:17:23,557 --> 00:17:25,507
You've made him important.

281
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:28,190
Acted out love, and then an engagement,

282
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,586
And now it's time for 12 Labours of Farah to find him and bring him back!

283
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,657
12 Labours?

284
00:17:32,657 --> 00:17:34,437
To find him and bring him back?

285
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:36,008
What are you saying?

286
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:37,897
I'm only saying what I am seeing,

287
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:39,958
And whoever's seen it

288
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,818
Is out of control.

289
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,840
You've turned everyone in the house around your finger.

290
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,586
Do you know what happened in the morning?

291
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:47,476
What?

292
00:17:47,476 --> 00:17:49,926
Your Dad left his cellphone at home.

293
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:51,636
What's bad about that?

294
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:52,760
I've left my phone --

295
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,096
At home many times, too.

296
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:56,196
Listen to the whole thing, Farah.

297
00:17:56,196 --> 00:18:00,627
He went and called me from the office, saying, 'Irsa, I've forgotten something important at home'.

298
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:01,548
I asked,

299
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,159
'What have you forgotten'?

300
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:03,968
He said,

301
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:06,538
'I'll call you when I can remember'.

302
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,844
So, could he not remember?

303
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:11,554
He could, the very next minute.

304
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:15,779
He called and asked, 'Any news about Afzal'?

305
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:17,839
Afzal?

306
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,760
He was referring to his cellphone as 'Afzal'!

307
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,990
Your Dad left his cellphone at home.

308
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,506
He went and called me from the office, saying, 'Irsa, I've forgotten something important at home'.

309
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:45,420
I asked,

310
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,046
'What have you forgotten'?

311
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:47,846
He said,

312
00:18:47,846 --> 00:18:50,536
'I'll call you when I can remember'.

313
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:52,776
So, could he not remember?

314
00:18:52,776 --> 00:18:55,150
He could, the very next minute.

315
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,542
He called and asked, 'Any news about Afzal'?

316
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:01,787
I swear by God I didn't say that.

317
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:05,971
Your seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you've gone mad.

318
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:08,307
Lubna?
-Just see one for once.

319
00:19:08,307 --> 00:19:11,552
At least it'll satisfy everyone.

320
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,484
I'm your sister,

321
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:23,047
Which is why I double as a psychiatrist in times of need.

322
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,559
The truth is that your madness does not convince people!

323
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,919
Care to ask

324
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,757
What happened to Afzal's photograph,

325
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:32,877
And what Arifa said when I asked her for one?

326
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,128
What did she say?

327
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:37,208
She said you don't even deserve his photograph.

328
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,221
Tell me,

329
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,518
Do you?

330
00:19:39,518 --> 00:19:40,353
No.

331
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,234
Not at all.

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,462
<i>O Prophet, peace be upon you.</i>

333
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:56,950
<i>O Messenger, peace be upon you.</i>

334
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,437
<i>O Beloved, peace be upon you.</i>

335
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:05,680
<i>Prayers of the Lord be upon you.</i>

336
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,986
<i>O Prophet, peace be upon you.</i>

337
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:14,367
<i>O Messenger, peace be upon you.</i>

338
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:18,747
<i>O Beloved, peace be upon you.</i>

339
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:23,628
<i>Prayers of the Lord be upon you.</i>

340
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,651
Ball -- Throw the ball.

341
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,081
Uncle Reverend!

342
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:04,886
Uncle Reverend!

343
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,882
Yes, Babloo?

344
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,410
How come you're here, Uncle Reverend?

345
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,000
What are you asking, my good man?

346
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,516
I've come to watch your match.

347
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:20,947
In all honesty, I've only realised it today

348
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,283
That if you just play cricket,

349
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:25,138
There can be no better sport

350
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:27,589
Than cricket.

351
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,994
Hey, Babloo!

352
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,217
Why are you crying?

353
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,837
I am the one who'd dropped him.

354
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:39,026
I'd had him board the train.

355
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,990
Don't stroke my cheek with affection.

356
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,157
Slap me, Reverend.

357
00:22:43,157 --> 00:22:44,916
No.

358
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:49,947
The fault is not yours, Babloo, my dear.

359
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:54,230
If the one who's going is unbending in his intentions,

360
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,906
The fault never lies with the one who drops him off.

361
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:00,687
Go,

362
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,228
And play,

363
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:03,700
But

364
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,646
Just play cricket.

365
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,046
You're sitting here!

366
00:23:26,856 --> 00:23:30,116
I considered waiting at his doorstep to receive you,

367
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,676
But changed my mind later.

368
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:35,707
Care to properly tell me the reason for going there?

369
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,208
I'd gone to talk about the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties].

370
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,267
That's it?

371
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:40,772
That's all you said?

372
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:42,395
I didn't even have to say it!

373
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:44,992
They were reciting the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties] when I'd gone there.

374
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:47,152
I recited too.

375
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,833
Splendid.

376
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,403
You folks think over here,

377
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:53,720
And they act on it over there.

378
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,966
Yes, it surprised me too.

379
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:58,437
But it felt great to see

380
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,002
That everyone thinks alike in times of sorrow.

381
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,547
What's the sorrow with you folks?

382
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:04,751
Leave it, Farah.

383
00:24:04,751 --> 00:24:08,100
You feel sorrow over his departure too.

384
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,967
Don't you?

385
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,458
You think so much about his Mum and Dad,

386
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,886
You were even prepared to run an advertisement on TV.

387
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:20,697
It's a different matter that you changed your mind later on.

388
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:24,707
But your feelings have been made clear.

389
00:24:25,946 --> 00:24:28,467
From now, you're not going to his place without asking me.

390
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,543
Why?

391
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:31,288
It's my friend's house!

392
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,050
How can you stop me from going to my friend's house?

393
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,286
Arifa's friends with <i>me</i>, too.

394
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,587
<i>I<i> go there too.

395
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:43,028
Do you know why she didn't invite me to recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties]?

396
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,528
Ask why she hadn't invited me.

397
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:46,339
Why didn't she?

398
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,579
Because the blame for Afzal running away

399
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:50,209
Has fallen on me!

400
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,351
Not at all.

401
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:53,601
No one's blamed you for anything.

402
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:55,689
That's their gentility.

403
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,169
But I know the fault lies with me.

404
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:01,219
That's why I've decided

405
00:25:01,219 --> 00:25:03,228
That I'll leave no stone unturned

406
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,889
To wash this blame off me.

407
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,227
I thought this door leads to your place, so...

408
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:09,196
I came here on the pretext of handing you the utensils.

409
00:26:09,196 --> 00:26:11,036
Pretext, as in?

410
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,052
No, it's --

411
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,213
Babu Hamid thinks

412
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:16,440
I've broken your heart.

413
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,946
I couldn't fall asleep.

414
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,256
Afzal!

415
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,746
Afzal, get up.

416
00:26:40,412 --> 00:26:42,827
Get ready; he's here.

417
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,086
He's riding a motorcycle?

418
00:26:49,086 --> 00:26:52,282
'He' is riding motorcycles.

419
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:53,866
What do I do?

420
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,517
Open the door on the inside and go upstairs,

421
00:26:55,517 --> 00:26:57,710
Jump across and get inside the house next to this one.

422
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,616
Alright?

423
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm not talking about fleeing,

424
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,057
But about fighting.

425
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:05,150
Don't think of doing anything stupid; you have little time,

426
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,018
Get up.

427
00:27:06,018 --> 00:27:06,830
And leave this place.

428
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,026
Get up.

429
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,759
I'll flee on one condition.

430
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,380
Go on.

431
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,786
Quickly.

432
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:16,090
If I run away,

433
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,344
You'd fight them.

434
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:19,536
Done.

435
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,320
Go,

436
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,216
I'll fight them.

437
00:27:22,576 --> 00:27:24,337
You bugger!

438
00:27:24,337 --> 00:27:25,736
You're a lone wolf.

439
00:27:25,736 --> 00:27:27,257
They'll kill you.

440
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:28,316
What does it matter, boyo?

441
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,402
If they spare me, the cops will kill me.

442
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,456
You'd better get out.

443
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,169
He hasn't knocked the door yet.

444
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:34,836
I'd have to open it if he knocks,

445
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:37,300
Or he'd break through it.

446
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,071
You're a Lahori, aren't you?

447
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,127
Talk like the Lahoris do.

448
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,877
Why are you besmirching the reputation?

449
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:44,927
C'mon.

450
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:46,837
C'mon.

451
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,762
Where are you going, Mam?

452
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:33,321
It's not Wali.

453
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:35,815
Just two lads showing off stunts on their bikes.

454
00:28:35,815 --> 00:28:37,386
They've left.

455
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,620
C'mon, shake hands with me.

456
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,191
I used to think Babu Hamid was a coward.

457
00:29:01,191 --> 00:29:04,902
I swear by you, I'm a pure coward.

458
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,225
And I swear you're one, too.

459
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:11,881
This courage is just a necessity...

460
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:15,715
One feels ashamed to die by the hands of one like Wali.

461
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,656
Who exactly

462
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,853
Is this Wali?

463
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,450
Jasmine's Mam is his Modryb.

464
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,890
If she's his Aunt, why doesn't she let him in?

465
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,564
He's got his eyes on Jasmine.

466
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,641
He says, 'I'll marry her'.

467
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,956
Doesn't she want to?

468
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:31,890
She'd rather spit in his face.

469
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,281
The bugger's an ace ruffian.

470
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:35,320
Hey!

471
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,040
She should just talk to him for a change.

472
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,283
If he actually loves her, he'll give up his thuggery.

473
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,681
What'd he do with his wife?

474
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,706
He's already married.

475
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:46,680
And he had a 'love marriage' back then.

476
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,641
In fact, I've heard it wasn't his first.

477
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,681
He's had one before that, too.

478
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:53,606
His 'love' lasts 6 months, and his 'marriage' 7.

479
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,077
He leaves the old one

480
00:29:55,077 --> 00:29:56,837
A month after his 'love' ends.

481
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,453
Why is his name Wali [Saint] then?

482
00:29:59,453 --> 00:30:02,683
His name should be 'Lovely'.

483
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:07,829
The bugger's besmirching the name of every saint out there.

484
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,206
You gave me a fright there!

485
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,121
What happened?

486
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:23,546
I can't sleep.

487
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:25,036
Me neither.

488
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:26,562
Come.

489
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:30,372
Want some juice?

490
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,897
Yes, give me some.

491
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,451
Who said the thing about the psychiatrist?

492
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,361
I mean,

493
00:30:44,361 --> 00:30:47,006
Whose idea was it?

494
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:48,657
Mine...

495
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:52,810
So you think I should see a psychiatrist?

496
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,276
No.

497
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,346
I don't now.

498
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:57,897
I think I was wrong.

499
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,878
Don't say that.

500
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,785
I think you're right.

501
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:07,346
I should see a psychiatrist.

502
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:08,615
Why?

503
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:10,476
I mean, why do you think so?

504
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,987
I've started thinking about people

505
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:15,320
About whom I shouldn't really be bothered.

506
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,879
Who, for example?

507
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:18,336
Name a few.

508
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,686
For instance, I was just thinking about Mehtab.

509
00:31:20,686 --> 00:31:21,957
I started thinking

510
00:31:21,957 --> 00:31:24,227
That, seeing how he'd left my swing in flames,

511
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:28,437
How he must be up in flames all within himself!

512
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:31,104
Then? So what?

513
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,916
It's alright.

514
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:36,076
But I shouldn't really be thinking of him.

515
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,707
The thing is,

516
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,227
Deep down, you're a compassionate girl,

517
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,138
And, over time,

518
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:44,858
You're forgetting the sorrow of the burning swing,

519
00:31:44,858 --> 00:31:46,992
And you're beginning to pity Mehtab now.

520
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,803
No, it's not that.

521
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,526
Then,

522
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,667
What is it?

523
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:56,948
I'm thinking that Afzal

524
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:59,559
Has eloped with the Farah who used to write him letters.

525
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,562
That's why I should not go to Karachi.

526
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:03,359
Where's the logic in this?

527
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,364
It's pure logic, Lubna.

528
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,615
If I chanced upon him in Karachi,

529
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:10,825
He'd think I've come to Karachi for him, wouldn't he?

530
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:12,035
Although

531
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:15,806
It really feels so cheap to even think of it.

532
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,310
Find out

533
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,844
Who the best psychiatrist in Hyderabad is.

534
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:23,681
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.

535
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:25,730
Good night.

536
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,120
Good night.

537
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,620
Also,

538
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,770
Mum and Dad must not know about it.

539
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,480
Don't worry.

540
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,051
Promise?

541
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:37,701
Promise.

542
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,836
Jasmine!

543
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,536
Jasmine!

544
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,287
Jasmine, get up!

545
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,710
What is it, Mam?

546
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,206
I'm very afraid.

547
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:18,746
You're a grown-up and yet afraid, Mam?

548
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,736
You've grown up.

549
00:33:20,736 --> 00:33:23,236
That's why I'm afraid.

550
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:26,016
It's 2, Mam.

551
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,472
He won't be coming now.

552
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,577
It's better if he does come tonight.

553
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:38,497
At least this long night of waiting for tomorrow will end.

554
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,358
Shall I get you some tea?

555
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,548
Alright.

556
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,997
What happened?

557
00:35:00,997 --> 00:35:03,074
He's here.

558
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:05,456
Give me the gun.

559
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,202
Give it to me!

560
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,067
You're not opening the door.

561
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,943
The bugger's laughing!

562
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:33,754
Putting up a show of courage?

563
00:35:33,754 --> 00:35:36,814
I give you another chance to save your life:

564
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:41,014
Get me up on your shoulders and drop me before my Jasmine.

565
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,079
Ahh!

566
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,676
So that's why your Aunt doesn't let you in!

567
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:50,457
Yes

568
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,140
Yes or no?

569
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,317
Alright,

570
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,806
Let's rather not fight.

571
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:56,256
Your name's Wali [Saint].

572
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:58,222
At least live up to your name, mate.

573
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:58,933
Yes

574
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,093
Yes or no?

575
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:02,319
Had you been in Hyderabad,

576
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:05,896
Your cronies would be pleading before you with their hands folded,

577
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,600
'Save your life, Wali',

578
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,082
'Don't ruffle Afzal's feathers'!

579
00:36:10,082 --> 00:36:12,933
Yes or blimmin' no?

580
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,386
Hey!

581
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:53,751
I'll feed you your teeth, you bugger!

582
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:58,041
My second punch will break your jaw!

583
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,410
As if you will deliver a single blow, M. Wali!

584
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,521
It's your crony who's doing the dirty work.

585
00:37:21,927 --> 00:37:23,709
Wait.

586
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,830
He's mine!

587
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,679
You bleedin' --

588
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,851
Pakku, Nasir, Wahid --

589
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:32,142
Fill the bugger with lead!

590
00:38:41,241 --> 00:38:43,470
Deal with the bugger.

591
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,881
I'll handle the shooters.

592
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,727
Nobody here takes a bullet or a beating for someone,

593
00:38:57,727 --> 00:39:01,630
And only those fear the gun who don't have one themselves,

594
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,450
Or lack the guts to fire one.

595
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:08,947
I'm the son of Reverend Subhanallah, M. Wali,

596
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,700
And he used to tell me,

597
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,101
'Death stands guard over life',

598
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,186
'Do not fear it';

599
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,476
'Fear life'

600
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:21,649
'For it will kill you off where you'll not have the slightest relief'.

601
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,566
Begone, now!

602
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,847
I'll spare you.

603
00:39:31,977 --> 00:39:35,589
That's alright,

604
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:38,076
Thank you very much.

605
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,652
But I won't spare you, Wali.

606
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,410
I was never, in Dad's eyes, a good son,

607
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:54,877
But never did he grab my collar, you bugger!

608
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,786
Quiet!

609
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,346
Don't scream!

610
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:36,036
People will remember your screams and laugh at you!

611
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:40,487
What are you looking at here and there?

612
00:40:40,487 --> 00:40:44,738
Rats don't make good soldiers in the legions of wolves.

613
00:40:45,398 --> 00:40:46,938
Alright.

614
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,669
Forgive me.

615
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,887
Alright, I forgive you.

616
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,071
May I go?

617
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,377
What's the hurry?

618
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,386
Come.

619
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:19,051
Come, let's sit here for a while.

620
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:20,702
C'mon!

621
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:23,861
Sit.

622
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,850
Forgive me, too.

623
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,001
In my childhood,

624
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,190
Someone insulted me.

625
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,981
I beat him black and blue.

626
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:44,636
He asked forgiveness.

627
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:48,012
When Dad found out, he said, you should apologise to him too.

628
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:50,456
I was just as surprised as you are.

629
00:41:50,456 --> 00:41:53,467
I said, 'But Dad, he insulted me'.

630
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,507
Dad said,

631
00:41:54,507 --> 00:41:56,548
'He's asked forgiveness for his mistake',

632
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,351
'And so should you for yours'.

633
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,082
So?

634
00:42:01,382 --> 00:42:03,928
Say that you forgive me.

635
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:06,753
I forgive.

636
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,974
There's one thing that's wrong with you.

637
00:42:11,974 --> 00:42:15,374
It pleases you to see that someone fears you.

638
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:16,913
No.

639
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:19,173
That's not right, mate.

640
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:22,044
Dad says that only the Lord has this right -

641
00:42:22,044 --> 00:42:23,684
That man should fear Him,

642
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:26,484
And He be pleased with it.

643
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:28,084
It angers Him

644
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:31,330
When a man fears another.

645
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:34,756
Fear His wrath.

646
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
