1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,856
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:19,124
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:24,224
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:30,649
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:36,155
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:40,879
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,914
Have some tea, my dear.

8
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm sure she's talked to you about going to London for her MPhil.

9
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,341
Yes.

10
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,448
Yes, she has.

11
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:51,348
What did you say?

12
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,800
I said,

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,300
'Alright, thank you'.

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,744
She should've been the one to say 'Thank you'.

15
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,370
I thanked her because she asked me.

16
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,945
Oh...

17
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,611
Good...

18
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:05,151
Excuse me.

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,799
It's my sister.

20
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,761
Hello?

21
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,722
Yes, how's it going?

22
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:18,322
You're still awake?

23
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:19,745
I'm asking you how it's going.

24
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,964
Have you succeeded?

25
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:23,681
Succeeded?

26
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,262
The meeting's going on.

27
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:28,623
It'll be over in a while.

28
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,209
You're hiding something.

29
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,954
I'll be back -- In a while.

30
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,065
Sorry.

31
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,660
If I don't answer her call,

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,356
She gets angry over it.

33
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,990
So, you were saying

34
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,023
She'll be going to London for her MPhil?

35
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:46,050
That's done, old chap.

36
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,750
Tell me - if the marriage is indeed fixed,

37
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,340
Would you go to London?

38
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,381
Not at all --
-But of course!

39
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,923
You just said yes inside!

40
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,189
That you'd go along!

41
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,660
I would, of course,

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,652
But it doesn't seem nice

43
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:03,490
That the wife goes to London for her studies,

44
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,040
And the husband follows her around like a bodyguard.

45
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,084
My conscience doesn't quite allow me.

46
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:11,824
But I've agreed to.

47
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,111
That's like a man.

48
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,283
Alright, then. See you tomorrow morning at 9 at the office.

49
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:25,430
Hear good news as you leave that we are both very pleased to meet you.

50
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,500
And we

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,534
Have no objections to this marriage.

52
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,823
Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,404
Tell her, too.

54
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:42,306
She'll be delighted too!

55
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,816
Alright.

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,668
Who can it be?

57
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,070
Young lady,

58
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,671
Would you see who it is?

59
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,806
I'll take my leave.

60
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:57,227
Best of luck.

61
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:58,426
Thank you, sir.

62
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll ask the driver to leave you --
-No, sir.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,940
It's just about four streets away to my home.

64
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,860
I'll go myself.

65
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,599
I've told her.

66
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,738
She's delighted to hear.

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,330
Goodbye, my dear.
-Goodbye.

68
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,914
What happened?

69
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:25,317
It's him again!

70
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,338
Who's there again?

71
00:04:26,338 --> 00:04:28,425
The same who'd come before.

72
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:29,990
Tell me his name.

73
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,078
I don't quite remember his name.

74
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,075
Peace be upon you.

75
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,286
And upon you, peace...

76
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,055
Please have the outer gate opened; my car's outside.

77
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:46,260
Go.

78
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,044
Open the gate.

79
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,519
She dashed inside the moment she saw me.

80
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,348
He's --

81
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:55,390
Mehtab Bhai.

82
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,260
Who's this?

83
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,089
Afzal.

84
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,430
Alright, Afzal, you may leave.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,928
Same here.

87
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,290
What is it <i>this time</i>?</i>

88
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,702
He's here.

89
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,982
Wh --

90
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,010
I think you want to say

91
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,591
'He's gone'?

92
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,760
Not at all.

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,548
I'm saying 'He's here'.

94
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:47,175
With his Mum!

95
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:48,589
Hey!

96
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,132
His Mum's here too!

97
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,412
Care to ask who I'm talking about?

98
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:55,967
Who are you talking about?

99
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,608
Mehtab Chawla.

100
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,194
His Mum's with him,

101
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:01,106
And both of them have such expressions

102
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,610
As the spectral undead!

103
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,733
In fact,

104
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,770
In fact, if Dad declined a second time,

105
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,164
Aunt Shugufta would be no more.

106
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:13,862
Why would he be any more, the spalpeen!
-Look at his face.

107
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:15,976
He doesn't need to die a second time.

108
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,957
It would be better if you get some rest tonight.

109
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:21,238
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

110
00:06:21,238 --> 00:06:23,484
All tranquility's been burnt to ashes, Monseigneur.

111
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,180
Would you look at him?

112
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,212
He's not slept for three days!

113
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:29,081
Ain't right, my dear.

114
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,540
It's important to get some sleep.

115
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,424
Why don't you

116
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:33,952
Give him that pill --

117
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,543
Whatsit --

118
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:37,423
Leave the name.

119
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:38,733
If he takes one now,

120
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,527
He'll wake up tomorrow in the afternoon, all fresh!

121
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,280
I have it with me; should I get it?

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,892
I've gotten him many pills,

123
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,600
Begged him day and night,

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,724
'Take one, my dear'.

125
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,355
'If you sleep for a while, you'd find peace'.

126
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:53,478
But do you know what he said?

127
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,154
What?

128
00:06:55,977 --> 00:07:00,468
He said, 'I'll find peace when I take a bullet right here in the chest'.

129
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:01,839
Hey!

130
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,247
Why are you crying, Madame?

131
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,289
Please, be brave.

132
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,311
Don't ask me to be brave, Monseigneur.

133
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,871
Please change your decision.

134
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:13,901
I told you we'll talk about it tomorrow.

135
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,858
I can beg Farah if you'd rather...

136
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,636
I'll fall at her feet.

137
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:23,170
I'll ask forgiveness if he's unknowingly said something wrong to her.

138
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,267
No -- Not at all --

139
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,553
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:28,707
Monseigneur, we accept every condition of hers.

141
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:31,780
If she wants to go to London for her studies, we have no objections.

142
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,704
He won't even go along with her.

143
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,468
It's just a matter of two years.

144
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,703
He'll wait.

145
00:07:38,364 --> 00:07:40,448
That's fine,

146
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:43,709
But there's <i>someone else</i> who's going with her.</i>

147
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,960
Good.

148
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
Why should the girl leave the country all alone?

149
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,707
Someone ought to go along.

150
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:52,308
You didn't quite get it...

151
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:55,194
We've decided something else.

152
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:56,565
We've talked about it

153
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,499
And Farah is delighted too.

154
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,954
What have you decided?

155
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:03,291
We'll talk tomorrow.

156
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,200
He doesn't seem well.

157
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,795
Mehtab?

158
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,600
Why don't you say something, my dear?

159
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,175
Yes?

160
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:12,958
Mehtab,

161
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,133
Have you had anything to eat?

162
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,048
Nothing.

163
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,710
I think he had something the day before yesterday.

164
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,230
What did you have?

165
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,350
Right,

166
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,774
I'd gone to the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi.

167
00:08:22,774 --> 00:08:24,817
I'd received some rice as sacrament,

168
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:28,510
He'd eaten it because he wanted the blessings.

169
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,798
He just drinks water now.

170
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,555
Won't you eat something?

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,885
Get up.

172
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:42,979
Go and eat something right now.

173
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,571
Get up!

174
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,847
Irsa, take him and get him something to eat.

175
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,056
Come, my dear.

176
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,820
One doesn't stop eating over such trifles.

177
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,404
Come.

178
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,645
Monseigneur,

179
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:02,311
For the love of God, have some mercy.

180
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,882
Look at his condition.

181
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,685
I'd said we'll talk about it tomorrow.

182
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:11,638
For now, go and have something to eat, and then get some rest.

183
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:12,613
No...

184
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,843
I'll meet Farah first.

185
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:17,052
Please, do meet her.

186
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:20,232
But don't beg before her.

187
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,069
Alright.

188
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,976
This is utter harlequinade!

189
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:10,878
Coming here with his Mum when I've rejected the proposal!

190
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:12,071
Now he'll stay here

191
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,184
Waltz around before everyone,

192
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,060
And grab my hand the moment he gets a chance!

193
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,981
Splendid.

194
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,443
Why would he grab your hand now?

195
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,420
And if he does indeed by mistake,

196
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,609
Whack him nicely with the same hand!

197
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:23,580
That option is off the table now!

198
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,131
I'll clobber him on the head with something!

199
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,523
And create such a scene

200
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,068
That Dad will call the police!

201
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,664
Think about it.

202
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,982
I've thought over it!

203
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:36,264
Don't look at his face then.
-God forbid!

204
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,832
Why, though?

205
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:40,966
You'd have mercy on him.

206
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:42,825
It's today that I've seen, Farah,

207
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:45,940
What one who's lost in love looks like.

208
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,197
God forgive.

209
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:48,700
A face that's drooping,

210
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,366
A visage devoid of all vigour,

211
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,225
With exanimate eyes...

212
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,023
I have to see him once!

213
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:56,898
Not once, but a hundred times.

214
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,990
I've come here to have you see him.

215
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,816
Uh -- A -- Aunt --

216
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:08,462
I -- I'm sorry...

217
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:11,043
The thing is --

218
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:14,090
P -- Please, sit.

219
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,570
I'll sit at your feet now that I've come.

220
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,323
I'm not leaving with a rejection.

221
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:23,735
What can I do?

222
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,613
He's my only son!

223
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:29,484
I can't see him languish in love!

224
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,700
Call him a blighter,

225
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,043
Or an unsuccessful lover,

226
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:41,260
Or say that the very sight of him stings you;

227
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,290
Say what you will, my dear,

228
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,909
But nobody can stop a drowning man from flailing.

229
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:52,058
But I can assure you

230
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:55,116
He won't grab your hand.

231
00:11:57,393 --> 00:12:01,295
That option is off the table, thanks to you.

232
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,183
I've talked to your father.

233
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,075
He says he'll talk tomorrow.

234
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,002
I'll stay awake all night, waiting for tomorrow.

235
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,808
Only God knows

236
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:24,181
How <i>he</i> would while the night away...</i>

237
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,455
It's Afzal!

238
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:44,904
Hello?

239
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:46,519
It's Afzal.

240
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,389
I know. Go on.

241
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,868
I won't meet your father in the morning.

242
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,425
Bravo!

243
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:54,577
He's come up with something.

244
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:56,080
What will you do?

245
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,598
I'll resign from this job.

246
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:00,855
Which job?

247
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:03,985
The one I'm doing for 200,000 a month.

248
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:05,732
Why?

249
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,610
I won't two-time her.

250
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,046
What did he say?

251
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:22,395
He said, 'I won't two-time her'.

252
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,486
Hello?

253
00:13:46,486 --> 00:13:48,274
What did you just tell Lubna?

254
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:51,291
You'd abandon me right in the middle of the rapids?

255
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,372
Right,

256
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,485
I get it,

257
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:56,690
You would've realised that my boat's about to run aground.

258
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,770
So you would've thought, 'Let's blackmail the girl'!

259
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:03,860
You could've asked for a raise, if that's what you want!

260
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,579
I squander a few hundred thousand just like that!

261
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:08,909
Tell me.

262
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,393
How much do you want?

263
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,333
What's your new rate?

264
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,613
And remember,

265
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,177
I won't let you waver

266
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,646
From the amount that we decide now.

267
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,170
Tell me!

268
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,171
Go on!

269
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,689
He's getting embarrassed now!

270
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:24,949
But natural

271
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,809
For a Reverend's son!

272
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:28,353
But no problem,

273
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:30,415
You can demand unrepentantly!

274
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,213
Tell me!

275
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,723
Hey!

276
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,017
He's hung up!

277
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,421
As if he'd quietly listen to your ignoble banter!

278
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,884
How much have you paid him?

279
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,751
Or is he begging for a penny that you're so scoffing!

280
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,570
You should remember, Mademoiselle Farah Ibrahim,

281
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,754
He's been working without pay so far.

282
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,874
Neither have you given him a penny, nor has he asked for one.

283
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,576
The cell phone, suit and boots you'd gotten him was your problem

284
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:58,831
And not his demand.

285
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,639
Yet, you only need to ask and he'd return all of it.

286
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,054
I can assure as much.

287
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,740
Pray tell, then,

288
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,554
What gives you the right to use such harsh expletives?

289
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,646
No such deal was struck, after all,

290
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,383
That he'd be kind to you,

291
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,566
And you'd be so lippy with him!

292
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,847
So lippy!

293
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:30,888
To be honest, you're abusing him!

294
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,381
I thought he was resigning to get a rise.

295
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,058
Not at all.

296
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,501
He's resigning to be spared all of this.

297
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:41,420
You hatch a new plot every five minutes,

298
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,931
And the situation changes every sixth minute.

299
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,512
What can the poor man do?

300
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,488
You work out a plan about 'love' at night,

301
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,926
And expect him to act out his hatred in the morning.

302
00:15:52,926 --> 00:15:55,629
It had been decided that he'd love you with all his life for four months.

303
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:57,742
And you're urging him on the fourth day

304
00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:01,451
To two-time you and be done with it.

305
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,417
That's not how it is, Farah.

306
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,698
Even a veteran actor can't give such a performance!

307
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:10,356
But he's still performing.

308
00:16:10,356 --> 00:16:12,643
He handles the situation in a moment.

309
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,107
Pause and think

310
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:17,083
You brought him before someone like Dad,

311
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,476
And said to him, 'Prove it that you deserve Farah'.

312
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:21,857
Has he not proven

313
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,676
That he deserves you?

314
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:25,423
Dad's singing his praises!

315
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:28,217
And a lady like Mum who scorns more when she talks

316
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:30,737
Has forgotten everything about the poor man's status.

317
00:16:30,737 --> 00:16:32,850
What else can he do?

318
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,573
Breathe fire like a dragon?

319
00:16:36,183 --> 00:16:38,997
Honestly

320
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,395
I was just furious at Mehtab for dropping in.

321
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:46,200
And I vented it out on him.

322
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:47,532
Well,

323
00:16:47,532 --> 00:16:49,595
That works for you.

324
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:51,108
How?

325
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,740
He said he won't two-time me.

326
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,500
He's two-timed you already.

327
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,910
When he said he's resigning from the job and going back to his world,

328
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,982
It means he's gone from yours.

329
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:02,740
He's two-timed you.

330
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,153
Now, plan out everything after it.

331
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,189
Weep and wail,

332
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:08,601
Break your bangles!

333
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:09,577
Rather,

334
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,243
This isn't the occasion to break bangles.

335
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:12,870
Just weeping will be enough.

336
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,898
Withdraw into your room

337
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,103
And keep on weeping and wailing!

338
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,911
Are you insane?

339
00:17:18,911 --> 00:17:22,446
Won't Dad go to his place if I start crying?

340
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:24,742
He'd kill him!

341
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,118
Think about it this way -

342
00:17:33,118 --> 00:17:34,729
If it happened this way,

343
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:38,768
Wouldn't it strengthen that blighter Mehtab's case?

344
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,658
So what should be done then?

345
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,800
Call him.

346
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,245
What will you say?

347
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,003
I won't say anything.

348
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,507
You should talk to him.

349
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:53,559
Tell him

350
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,000
Not to two-time me.

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,824
He should go on with his love for now.

352
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,625
He isn't answering.

353
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:23,804
He must've retired.

354
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:25,175
Impossible.

355
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:29,614
One can only die - not sleep - after such humiliation.

356
00:18:32,002 --> 00:18:33,942
Shall we go to the terrace?

357
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,648
What?

358
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,453
I'll spend the night in vigil and penance.

359
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,140
I'll call him again and again.

360
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,532
Until he answers

361
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:42,990
And talks to me,

362
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,770
I'll stravaig about the terrace.

363
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,742
Wow...

364
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,222
What a way to expiate, mate...

365
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,823
I'm feeling very guilty, Lubna.

366
00:18:50,823 --> 00:18:52,652
Until I say sorry to him,

367
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,674
I can't be at peace.

368
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,421
I appreciate that

369
00:18:56,421 --> 00:18:58,017
But I'm feeling sleepy, Farah.

370
00:18:58,017 --> 00:19:00,048
I have to go to University in the morning.

371
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:02,081
How can you leave me here?

372
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:04,915
Can't you stay awake with me in my sorrow?

373
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:06,479
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

374
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,410
But I can't be a part of a cabal

375
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,010
Whose chieftain would utterly disgrace someone and say,

376
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,824
'I'm ashamed at what I've done'.

377
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:19,641
I'll talk very sweetly to him now.

378
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:21,358
I sw --

379
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,520
I swear by you.

380
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,323
He'll answer.

381
00:19:55,323 --> 00:19:57,111
Keep on trying.

382
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:58,909
I think he's taken sleeping pills.

383
00:19:58,909 --> 00:19:59,861
No way.

384
00:19:59,861 --> 00:20:01,408
He's just angry.

385
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,497
Who can sleep after such humiliation?

386
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:06,753
Call him.

387
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,510
Okay, wait.

388
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,084
Text him.

389
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,273
Write,

390
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:13,153
'If you don't answer',

391
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,296
'I'll be paying you a visit'.

392
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:16,850
And if he doesn't answer?

393
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,827
I'll think the rapscallion's taken sleeping pills and fallen asleep.

394
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:20,847
Rapscallion?

395
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:23,982
Hey! I'm saying it affectionately.

396
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,099
Done.

397
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,966
Look what we have <i>here</i>!</i>

398
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,004
What are you doing here?

399
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,990
What could I do?

400
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,063
Look at your watch.

401
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,394
It's 2.00 a.m.

402
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,943
So it is by your watch.

403
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,529
I'm a rather harmless man, by the way.

404
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,105
It doesn't matter to you whether I am here or not.

405
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,822
Please go to your room

406
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:17,423
And sleep peacefully.

407
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:21,193
I don't think either of us can find peace.

408
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,940
I'm awake,

409
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,297
As are you.

410
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,690
I've been here since 11 p.m.

411
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,028
I'd prayed

412
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:31,938
That if my love is true,

413
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:35,312
You'd come up here within three hours.

414
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,333
Do you know

415
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,549
There were still five minutes left when you came up here.

416
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,272
Don't they have good trick cyclists in Karachi?

417
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:46,730
They have.

418
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,006
But mine is in Hyderabad.

419
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:52,211
Have your prayers been accepted?

420
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,196
Yes.

421
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:54,232
They've been.

422
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,980
So leave, would you?

423
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,982
The two of us have come up here for something important.

424
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:02,180
Forgive me,

425
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,224
But I'm not getting up from this swing.

426
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:06,338
Why not?

427
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,700
You've sat with me on this swing twice.

428
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,133
This swing is my place of worship, Mademoiselle Farah.

429
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,025
Then this swing is henceforth yours.

430
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:18,360
Put it in your car,

431
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,890
And take it along.

432
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:22,387
Hey!

433
00:22:22,387 --> 00:22:24,385
That's brilliant.

434
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,530
What would I do with <i>just</i> the swing?</i>

435
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,142
I've tried sitting on it alone.

436
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:32,930
It's been asking me all this time, 'Where's your partner'?

437
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:35,562
Who?

438
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,522
Who's been asking you?

439
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,794
You won't get it.

440
00:22:40,997 --> 00:22:43,761
Ask one who was informed on the way

441
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:46,925
That it's the wrong way.

442
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,278
I'm not leaving.

443
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,350
It is obligatory on me to take in this waft of air

444
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,267
Redolent of your fragrance.

445
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:11,162
Oh God!
-O God, hear my prayers!

446
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:14,380
What are you praying for?

447
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,016
I won't tell you.

448
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:17,255
Don't.

449
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:21,136
But don't you dare mention me in your prayers!

450
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,624
He's calling.

451
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,987
So talk to him!

452
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:28,630
Here. Let me talk.

453
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,273
Before Mehtab?

454
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:30,903
Yup!

455
00:23:30,903 --> 00:23:33,906
As if I'm afraid of anyone!

456
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,689
Hello?

457
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,067
It's Farah.

458
00:23:38,382 --> 00:23:40,698
Are you listening?

459
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,624
Just say a soft 'Hmm'.

460
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,245
I'll take it that you're listening.

461
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,969
Hmm.

462
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,574
Be done with your anger.

463
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,388
All that guff --

464
00:23:52,388 --> 00:23:55,446
I'd like to apologise for it.

465
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,593
Just keep on loving me,

466
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:02,040
So much

467
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,956
That beholders and earwiggers

468
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:06,862
Die of envy!

469
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,095
The plan about two-timing has been cancelled for now!

470
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,522
We'll talk about that

471
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:20,905
Once this rascal Mehtab is gone.

472
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,212
I hope you're listening?

473
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,642
Here.

474
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,085
Talk to him.

475
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:30,990
And ask him if he's heard everything I said.

476
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:31,747
And yes,

477
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,154
He didn't say 'It's okay'

478
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,538
In response to my apology.

479
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:36,192
Hello?

480
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:38,671
Lubna speaking.

481
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:40,022
I know.

482
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:43,243
Why didn't you say 'It's okay' in response to her apology?

483
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:44,960
It's okay.

484
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,935
There.

485
00:24:45,935 --> 00:24:46,789
Right,

486
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,130
Keep on 'loving' Farah

487
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,812
As long as she's in the soup!

488
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:52,834
I will.

489
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:54,590
But how is she in the soup?

490
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,715
Mehtab and his Mum have come here again!

491
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,046
He met you.

492
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:01,572
You shook hands with him at the gate, remember?

493
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,177
So he's Mehtab?

494
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:04,833
Obviously.

495
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:06,489
Tell him

496
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:08,724
I'll give him a cheque of 200,000 tomorrow.

497
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:09,476
Listen,

498
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:11,913
She'll give you your cheque tomorrow.

499
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,760
For what?

500
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,493
She's giving you your salary in advance.

501
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:17,986
Oh...

502
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,823
I'm sure you're pleased.

503
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,406
I'm very pleased.

504
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,211
But may I ask something?

505
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:27,597
Sure, go on.

506
00:25:27,597 --> 00:25:31,011
Does she love someone else too?

507
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:32,626
I mean,

508
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:35,441
Does she love someone?

509
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:38,318
Sorry.

510
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:39,832
Why are you saying sorry?

511
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:42,948
I figured I shouldn't have asked this.

512
00:25:42,948 --> 00:25:44,248
No, you may ask.

513
00:25:44,248 --> 00:25:46,010
But I don't have the answer to this.

514
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,765
As far as I'm aware, that wee laddie hasn't been born yet!

515
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,719
So may I meet your father tomorrow?

516
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,933
He's asking if he can meet Dad tomorrow.

517
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,210
He'd better.

518
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,000
In fact,

519
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,710
He should finalise everything with Dad!

520
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,545
I heard that.

521
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,330
And ask her, what if he asked me to bring my parents?

522
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,150
Bring them.

523
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,275
What's the problem with that?

524
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,708
Okay.

525
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,652
Good night.

526
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,214
Good night.

527
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,760
Don't you

528
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,200
Have any dreams these days?

529
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,520
I've made arrangements so I don't.

530
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,160
And if, perchance, I have a silly one,

531
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,585
I'd pray to it, 'Go, sir',

532
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:37,195
'Show yourself somewhere else'.

533
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,709
'There is no hope that you will be reified here'.

534
00:27:43,067 --> 00:27:46,468
How you warp those words...

535
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:48,621
And how is that?

536
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,300
Put it plainly

537
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,703
That reality scares you.

538
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:55,472
God forbid!

539
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,276
He has been very kind.

540
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:58,943
Everything is going on fine.

541
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,746
Why should I be scared?

542
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:06,191
Your son has lost his job.

543
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:15,860
I thought I'd rather ask you about your dreams

544
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,022
Because

545
00:28:18,022 --> 00:28:21,024
You conceal the truth so well.

546
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,971
Was that something to conceal or speak about?

547
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,453
What did he -- He was just a clerk.

548
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:29,163
As good as doing nothing.

549
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,977
I used to think what would happen

550
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,436
To Hazrat Sahab's foretelling if he started off as a mere clerk.

551
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:37,966
Perhaps it'd take a hundred years to be fulfilled.

552
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,659
God willing, he'd do something worthwhile now.

553
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:41,888
You'll see,

554
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,489
I'll have hopes again.

555
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,619
But then, where does he leave for at 8.30 in the morning?

556
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:57,677
He won't sit at home, after all!

557
00:28:57,916 --> 00:28:59,831
He tries his luck.

558
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:02,919
He'll find a post for himself on his own now.

559
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,407
But you don't trust him!

560
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,169
I trust him,

561
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:19,100
But it seems you don't trust me.

562
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:27,930
It is not necessary that I tell you every insignificant bit to prove that I trust you.

563
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,630
Only that it was significant,

564
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,287
Except when you said it.

565
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,453
By the way, is he looking for a post or a popsy?

566
00:29:42,007 --> 00:29:44,734
It'd do you good to remember carefully.

567
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,217
It's possible

568
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:50,281
That you accidentally uttered 'post' instead of 'popsy'.

569
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,933
So you know everything.

570
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,273
We are God's men, Madame.

571
00:30:02,273 --> 00:30:04,686
We get the news

572
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,450
Even when we don't get it.

573
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:11,705
The only thing I haven't been able to find out

574
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:15,179
Is who the popsy is.

575
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:19,040
Arifa knows.

576
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,713
She won't tell me.

577
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:26,964
How can she avoid telling when you ask?

578
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:30,550
She won't avoid

579
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,470
But it'd break her oath.

580
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,635
So, I thought

581
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:38,610
It's better that I remain in ignorance

582
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,466
Than commit the sin of breaking an oath.

583
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,090
You're cross with me.

584
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:26,311
I have lost the right to be cross.

585
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,221
Honestly, Reverend,

586
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,670
Is placating someone like this morally justified?

587
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,094
Politics isn't morally justified in love either,

588
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:41,879
Nor that you drag in the law at the time of need.

589
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:46,911
I consider this title of 'Reverend' an honour,

590
00:31:46,911 --> 00:31:50,808
And you use it as a barb.

591
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:55,001
It'd be better

592
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:57,030
If you don't conceal anything.

593
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,077
It's also better because

594
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:03,574
Nothing ever remains concealed.

595
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,257
Do you want me to apologise?

596
00:32:08,242 --> 00:32:09,959
There is no

597
00:32:09,959 --> 00:32:11,848
Injunction against

598
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:15,729
A wife's apology,

599
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:19,813
But if you apologise as a mother,

600
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,328
You'd get me in the mire.

601
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:27,585
And if it displeases the Master,

602
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:32,431
A lifelong of dominion shall be ravaged.

603
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,960
Then, here's a compliment.

604
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,435
Go on.

605
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,825
I consider this title of 'Reverend' an honour.

606
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:47,975
You may have me say it under oath.

607
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,382
How about some breakfast?

608
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:18,133
No,

609
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,604
Just some tea.

610
00:33:19,604 --> 00:33:21,402
Okay.

611
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,221
Know what,

612
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,110
I had a strange dream last night.

613
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,020
I saw you on the train headed for Karachi.

614
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,135
You had to see the train headed for Karachi!

615
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,832
Trains leave everyday, mate.

616
00:33:39,832 --> 00:33:41,735
Have I ever been to Karachi?

617
00:33:41,735 --> 00:33:43,988
Anyway, tell me about your dream.

618
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,045
I saw a girl with you.

619
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:48,779
I recognised her as soon as I saw her.

620
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:51,420
Who was it?

621
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,704
<i>Not</i> the one who writes you letters!</i>

622
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,540
What do you know who writes me letters?

623
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,013
I do know it <i>isn't</i> Sheikh Ibrahim's daughter.</i>

624
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:06,822
What are you saying?

625
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:08,601
She was with you in the dream.

626
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:13,122
She was so relaxed and convivial as if thoroughly acquainted with you!

627
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,734
W -- Which one?

628
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:15,763
The elder one.

629
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:16,739
I don't know her name.

630
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,100
Farah!

631
00:34:18,527 --> 00:34:19,878
Hey!

632
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:22,785
That's not how you mention someone!

633
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,486
I'm getting late.

634
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,919
Have your tea.

635
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,969
M -- Mum!

636
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,808
Mum!
-Mum!

637
00:34:58,808 --> 00:34:59,790
Mum!
-Mum!

638
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,890
What happened?
-Mehtab --

639
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,902
Mehtab?
-Come!

640
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,090
It kills me to see --

641
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,225
Mehtab!

642
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:11,816
My dear...

643
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:14,479
My child! Careful there --
-Quickly!

644
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:18,028
Easy there.
-He's losing a lot of blood...

645
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:20,820
Quick!

646
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,808
Let me go!

647
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:23,989
Mehtab!

648
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,570
He'll be alright, Aunt --
-He's bleeding!

649
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,580
Madame, please calm down.
-He'll be alright.

650
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,260
Easy, Aunt...
-My child...

651
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,754
Madame --

652
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:34,884
He'll be fine, Madame.

653
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,744
So much --

654
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,037
Aunt!

655
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:44,906
Aunt!

656
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,441
Aunt!
-Madame!

657
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,261
Why are you standing here like that? Go and get some water!

658
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:50,393
Madame!

659
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,151
Look here, Madame!

660
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:54,691
God willing, nothing will happen to him!

661
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:58,181
Easy there, Madame. Hopefully, we'll get some good news.

662
00:36:58,181 --> 00:36:59,340
Nothing will happen to him.

663
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,090
Madame...

664
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,810
My son --

665
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,436
He was still breathing.

666
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,086
I didn't let him lose a lot of blood.

667
00:37:11,086 --> 00:37:12,814
I tied my scarf

668
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,857
Around his wrist tightly.

669
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,788
Get up, Madame. Come.

670
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:18,730
What do I do?

671
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,050
Come.

672
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,970
Come here.

673
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,808
What happened to him?

674
00:37:27,808 --> 00:37:29,973
He slit his wrist.

675
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:32,778
Attempted suicide?

676
00:37:32,778 --> 00:37:34,413
Yes.

677
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,638
It's one for the police.

678
00:37:36,638 --> 00:37:37,990
It's one for the doctor.

679
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,399
Blood was gushing like a fountain before this scarf was tied.

680
00:37:40,399 --> 00:37:43,681
That's alright, but we'd have to inform the police.

681
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:47,542
Get him back among the living and then inform the police.

682
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,825
His heart is beating fine.

683
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,471
It would.

684
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:57,340
It's a rather chary attempt at suicide.

685
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,671
Bring him to.

686
00:37:58,671 --> 00:37:59,890
Nurse,

687
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,942
Get him on the drip.

688
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,168
How long will it take?

689
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:06,343
Just about 15 minutes.

690
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,198
But who is this?

691
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:12,503
Our guest from Karachi.

692
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:15,064
It seems his family's quite well off.

693
00:38:15,064 --> 00:38:16,472
Very well off,

694
00:38:16,472 --> 00:38:19,226
But he's very bad himself.

695
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,096
Why has he attempted suicide?

696
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:24,402
The police will ask about this.

697
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,334
Why tell the police? It's an internal matter.

698
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,697
He's opening his eyes!

699
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,922
<i>Our</i> eyes have been opened too.
-Where am I?</i>

700
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:50,373
You tell me - Where are you?

701
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,241
If you're still alive, let me tell you

702
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,406
You're still in Hyderabad.

703
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:55,650
And if you're dead,

704
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,790
You'll get to know after all your deeds have been accounted for.

705
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,061
Why am I still alive?

706
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:03,301
Because you didn't slit your wrist properly.

707
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:04,307
Alright, doctor,

708
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:05,658
Call the police.

709
00:39:05,658 --> 00:39:06,999
Police?

710
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:07,787
Why?

711
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:09,098
It's a legal affair.

712
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:11,646
There's only two ends you can get when you attempt suicide -

713
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:15,984
Straight to God if you're dead, and straight to the cops if you survive.

714
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:19,896
Kill me, doctor!

715
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:21,095
Don't worry.

716
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:22,557
Dad will be here soon.

717
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:24,961
Hopefully, he'll kill you!

718
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,865
Oh God, what will I say to Uncle?

719
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:31,414
Forget about Uncle,

720
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:34,873
Think about what you'd say to the cops!

721
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,270
The punishment for surviving is worse than that for dying!

722
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,805
The punishment for surviving is worse than that for dying!
-Mum!

723
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:40,969
Mum fell unconscious in a moment,

724
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:42,290
Only God knows

725
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,724
If she's been revived or not!

726
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,761
G -- Get this off me, doctor! I --

727
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,183
I'm going to see Mum!

728
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:49,575
Only after you've been unfettered!

729
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:51,870
For now, lie down!

730
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,562
There.

731
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:55,000
Dad's here.

732
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
