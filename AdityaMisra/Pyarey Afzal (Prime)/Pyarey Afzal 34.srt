1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,858
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:19,140
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,221
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:30,650
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,130
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,786
Who are you?

8
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,500
What are you looking at?

9
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,380
Tell me.

10
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,940
Who are you?

11
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,840
Whom do you want to meet?

12
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,426
Where do you come from?

13
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,490
Your face looks just like my Afzal's.

14
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,980
But you're not Afzal ['The Great One'].

15
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,970
The blighter's on the run, hiding his face from us.

16
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,970
Go away.

17
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,907
Go away -- away!

18
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,896
Get up.

19
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,360
I've recognised you.

20
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,100
I'm talking to you, remembering only those ties that you left unsevered.

21
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,820
You came here to hear about Dad,

22
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,230
And you'd left without listening to Dad?

23
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,790
He tripped and fell yesterday

24
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,666
Face-first.

25
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,810
Everyone else saw it yesterday,

26
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,980
But I had on that day itself

27
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,976
When you'd dropped him face-first.

28
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,010
His back's hunched now, you twit;

29
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,680
His gait's slowed down.

30
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,950
You left Hyderabad,

31
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,860
He left his priesthood.

32
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,530
You started walking down the path of God,

33
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,600
And he came back from the path of God.

34
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,930
Is this the path of God, Afzal?

35
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,990
Does God have one commit murders?

36
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,550
Hearing your news,

37
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,340
He evades God and starts talking about worldly affairs.

38
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,520
Don't say a word about meeting him.

39
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,580
Hear it from me,

40
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,640
And ask the doctors to satisfy yourself.

41
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,410
He's come to now.

42
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,620
He's talking,

43
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,450
Smiling,

44
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,180
And eating, now, too.

45
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm not leaving without meeting him.

46
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,238
And you'd leave once you've met?

47
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,880
Come again the next time

48
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,986
You get the news.

49
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,471
Who's that?

50
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,611
Is she with you?

51
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,520
There, now!

52
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,256
She's Jasmine, isn't she?

53
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:02,106
Come here, will you?

54
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,030
Alright now,

55
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,207
That's enough.

56
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,400
However did he chance upon you?

57
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,490
He's an ace hoodlum.

58
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,051
He may even murder you one day.

59
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,620
The blighter had gone to become a great man,

60
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,240
But has come back so low

61
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,880
That I have to search for my son in him.

62
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,680
Get aside, will you?

63
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,710
Move aside.

64
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,296
I have to ask your Dad for his judgement on meeting you.

65
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,696
May I come along?

66
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,080
Come.

67
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,660
But don't be too quick to tell

68
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,446
That you're someone to him.

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,580
Would you look at

70
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,880
Who's come!

71
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,051
Try to recognise who she is.

72
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,466
She's Jasmine, isn't she?

73
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:14,930
So you've come to steal all the coconut biscuits!

74
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,130
Now,

75
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,520
Will you sit,

76
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,580
Or meet me standing here and leave?

77
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,780
Not at all.

78
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,670
Why would I leave?

79
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,750
I've come here to meet and stay with you.

80
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,140
Did you hear that, Ruqaiyya?

81
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,570
She's

82
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,017
Come to stay with us.

83
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,986
Then,

84
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:45,736
Just stay here with us, will you?

85
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,400
He's sitting outside too.

86
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,820
What are your orders for him?

87
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,880
Tell him

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,010
I'm fine now.

89
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,240
He may prepare for his next attack.

90
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,130
He's crying buckets.

91
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,190
He says, 'I'm not leaving without meeting him'.

92
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:22,200
Ties of blood may be stinging him...

93
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,840
Our beloved son, Ruqaiyya Begum, is a benefaction bestowed upon us after many ardent prayers.

94
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,940
Whatever he may be like,

95
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,089
He must be in pain.

96
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,420
Tell him

97
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,140
That he's weeping seven months too late;

98
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,887
We've been weeping for seven months.

99
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,860
Kiss his forehead,

100
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,230
Shower your love on him,

101
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,817
Bless him and bid him goodbye.

102
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:16,880
If the rapscallion came before my eyes,

103
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,776
I'll start missing him again.

104
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,040
No, Ruqaiyya Begum,

105
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,300
Please don't take such a risk.

106
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,370
And what if he came and fell at your feet?

107
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,220
What would you do?

108
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,670
She's --

109
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,680
She's sitting before me.

110
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:53,510
I can't give him the reply he deserves.

111
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,660
Just tell him

112
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,288
That he can't meet me...

113
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,500
I'm actually a doctor,

114
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
But trust me, I'm

115
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,420
In a condition worse than any patient's right now.

116
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,710
You must be wondering who I am.

117
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,730
Good question.

118
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,040
Please tell him, would you?

119
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,427
He's Farah's fiancé.

120
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,400
It's -- Alright if you don't think of me as her fiancé.

121
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,310
The engagement didn't fully happen.

122
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,870
It just happened one way.

123
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,466
He didn't put the ring on her...

124
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,990
So,

125
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,769
You're from Karachi?

126
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,176
Yes.

127
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,320
What do you do?

128
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,240
I mean --

129
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,200
Business, for example.

130
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,416
One can start any kind of business in Karachi.

131
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,390
What happened to her?

132
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,810
Who?

133
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,570
The one who used to write you letters.

134
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,230
Well, you'd obviously be writing her back, too,

135
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,890
But I've heard more about the one who used to write to you.

136
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,130
Still talking, aren't you?

137
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,620
Still talking, isn't he?

138
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,270
Wh --

139
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,370
The Reverend?

140
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:11,990
Oh yes,

141
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,910
He's awrite.

142
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,030
Everyone's talking to him.

143
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,280
Tell me, will you?

144
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,507
What happened to her?

145
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,890
Why are you asking?

146
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,710
Whenever I sit with Farah,

147
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,020
We just talk about the two of you.

148
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,040
But I realised, seeing your fiancée today,

149
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,730
That you couldn't, so far,

150
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,381
Get the one who used to write you letters.

151
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,790
Someone else got her.

152
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,050
That's what happens the first time you love.

153
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,370
Sometimes, you don't get the letter,

154
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,946
And sometimes, you don't get the one who writes them.

155
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,490
Did you see that?

156
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,150
How he had her hand in his as he ran up the stairs?

157
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,680
Without the slightest shame, seeing that right I'm before him,

158
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,030
Nor the slightest sorrow that his Dad's had a heart attack!

159
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,250
She's his fiancée!

160
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,240
The fibster!

161
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,700
The crook!

162
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,140
The ignoble!

163
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,160
Why are you saying such foul words, Farah?

164
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,640
She met you so warmly.

165
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,030
And she's the one who had called to tell you.

166
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,191
However is she a crook and a fibster?

167
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,160
You're envying her, aren't you?

168
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,690
Why would I envy that chit?

169
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:03,910
Did you see her face?

170
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,010
My shoe looks prettier!

171
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,920
Control, Farah, control.

172
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,930
Whatever has happened to you?

173
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,460
Where's Sibtain?

174
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,130
We'd left Sibtain there.

175
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,490
He'll be with Uncle Reverend until the morning.

176
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,960
Why would he stay, now?

177
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,810
Now that that blighter's here!

178
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,100
And he's brought her along too!

179
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,630
Good Lord!

180
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,120
Look at her prance around him

181
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,810
After the engagement!

182
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,530
And she'd even held his hand to show everyone!

183
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,837
Call him!

184
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,480
What do I say?

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,060
Tell him to go home.

186
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,660
Let only the one who ought to be there stay.

187
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,950
We'll talk about everything else tomorrow.

188
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,560
What else is there to talk about?

189
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,630
I'll see

190
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,000
Who's got the nerve!

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,170
What are you talking about?

192
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,460
I'll call Sibtain and ask him to come here this instant.

193
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,810
You're not well.

194
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,190
Wait.

195
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,980
I'm good,

196
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,820
But my intentions aren't.

197
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,400
Please, Farah, relax.

198
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,000
It isn't the end of the world if he's gotten engaged.

199
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,470
What's an engagement, let him get married.

200
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,900
Whatever is it to you?

201
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,340
That's what I'm saying.

202
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,480
Now that he's gotten engaged,

203
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,910
He'd better get married, too!

204
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,650
Let him fix the same date.

205
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,100
The same date?

206
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,900
As my wedding.

207
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,050
Ask him to get married on the same day, will you?

208
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,600
When are you getting married?

209
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,790
Even your engagement's been stalled.

210
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,430
Just think there will be no engagement now.

211
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,910
What do you mean?

212
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,310
Why not?

213
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,280
Just try to understand, Lubna.

214
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm getting married this Sunday.

215
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,370
Which Sunday?

216
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,370
Next Sunday.

217
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,690
And tell him if you chance upon him tomorrow,

218
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,720
I dare him to this one if he's got the guts!

219
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,060
Let him fix the date for the next Sunday.

220
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,226
Let me see him get married, too!

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,610
He beats you everyday?

222
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,890
No.

223
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,080
Sometimes everyday,

224
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,970
And sometimes every second or third day.

225
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,230
And you think this induces your nightmares.

226
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,700
The faces

227
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,380
Of the ghosts that haunt you resemble your husband's.

228
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,637
Yes.

229
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,360
Arranged marriage?

230
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,520
No.

231
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,460
It was a love marriage.

232
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,437
Oh...

233
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,350
How many years has it been since your marriage?

234
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,360
One and a half.

235
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,870
And

236
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,580
How long have you been having nightmares?

237
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,271
It's been four months.

238
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,900
Another lass?

239
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,120
I mean --

240
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,430
I figure someone's come between the two of you.

241
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,520
There!

242
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,240
That's what you think, too?

243
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,480
So is that it?

244
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,020
That's it, Herr Doktor.

245
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,400
I used to say to him,

246
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,740
But he never agreed.

247
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,090
He'd fight with me,

248
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,540
Say foul words,

249
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,440
And claw away the strands of hair --

250
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,990
But your hair look fine.

251
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,100
They don't seem clawed.

252
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,150
No...

253
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,590
I'm talking about his hair.

254
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,200
That's his style.

255
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,530
He'd scream first,

256
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,830
Then hurl abuses,

257
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,570
And then start clawing at his hair.

258
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,670
And then?

259
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,960
And then he beats me.

260
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,110
Look at this...

261
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,350
Here...

262
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,070
No --

263
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,040
Please don't show me.

264
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,520
Just tell me.

265
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,100
I already have.

266
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,360
Who's the lass?

267
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,000
That's what I can't find out.

268
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,370
Whenever I name someone,

269
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,390
He says, 'She's my sister'.

270
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,910
He may be telling the truth.

271
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,270
How can that be?

272
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,070
He had only one sister when we got married.

273
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,540
Very sad.

274
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,510
He'd be enjoying himself at home, watching TV, while you're suffering.

275
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,320
Not at all.

276
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,960
I've left him at the other doctor.

277
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,510
The other doctor?

278
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,480
You mean another psychiatrist?

279
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,640
No.

280
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,440
The usual doctor.

281
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,310
One who treats injuries and all.

282
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,610
That one.

283
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,280
Injuries and all?

284
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,470
I've hit him on his face with a plate...

285
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,580
There's a little wound here.

286
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,006
Excuse me.

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
Hello?

288
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,260
Farah speaking.

289
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,350
My eyes brighten the moment I hear you call out to me;

290
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,210
In my mind is associated with your pleasant voice your unforgettable image.

291
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,570
Where are you?

292
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,090
At my clinic.

293
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,490
Where's Paw?

294
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,750
My Paw?

295
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,370
Of course.

296
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,870
He's at home.

297
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,470
Tell him to get out of the house,

298
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,200
Come to our place and meet Dad this instance.

299
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,190
Is there any problem?

300
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,370
We're getting married on Sunday.

301
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,026
Non, Mademoiselle, we're getting engaged on Sunday.

302
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,180
Forget the engagement.

303
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,150
Engagements are for the cheap!

304
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,320
How can that be?

305
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
What did you say?

306
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,850
I mean --

307
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,450
Why

308
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,490
Are you saying,

309
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,940
'We're getting married on Sunday'?

310
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,060
It struck right at my heart.

311
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,120
This is Farah Ibrahim speaking,

312
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,210
Sibtain Akhtar Ali!

313
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,390
Yes -- I know --

314
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,000
I know this --

315
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,530
Very well...

316
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,990
Know, then, that we're getting married on Sunday.

317
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,180
I do exactly as I say.

318
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,340
That's alright, but --

319
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,150
How can we get married so quickly?

320
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,110
One's got to prepare, and

321
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,900
It's Sibtain Akhtar Ali's wedding,

322
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,930
Not a pleb's that it --

323
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,680
It'd just happen.

324
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,220
Know what, Paw had gone to the zoo yesterday.

325
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,570
Why the zoo?

326
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,340
To ask about an elephant.

327
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,740
Elephant, as in?

328
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,930
Elephant, as in, the large animal with a trunk and two large tusks --

329
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,940
Jumbo, you know --

330
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,990
It's called an elephant.

331
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,280
So what?

332
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,600
What'd you do with one?

333
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
Paw's thinking

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,980
I'd ride one

335
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,720
When bringing the procession.

336
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,190
If the wedding procession doesn't get here on Sunday,

337
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,980
You'd better stay at home.

338
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,350
Or in your rotting clinic.

339
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,090
And if I see you somewhere after that,

340
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,076
I'd whack you with my boot!

341
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,580
This blighter's yet another watermelon

342
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,340
That isn't red on the inside!

343
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,420
Here's your phone.

344
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,466
Easy there.

345
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,427
Right here.

346
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,440
Now, he's

347
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,340
Come to an awareness about the difference between righteousness and sin, Ruqaiyya Begum.

348
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,580
He's standing like a stranger

349
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,040
Outside his own home.

350
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,626
The blighter!

351
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,628
That's alright.

352
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,557
Alright.

353
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,180
Just call him in and ask for once.

354
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:03,300
Hear from his own mouth whether he's among the righteous or the sinful.

355
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,650
Surely, your judgement cannot be mistaken, but

356
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,630
It may be mistaken, too.

357
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,370
There's no need, now,

358
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,580
To inquire further

359
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,950
Or hear any further explanations.

360
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,990
If he went back now, he may not be coming back.

361
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,700
As if he's come back now!

362
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,446
He's sent a murderer in his place.

363
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,920
My son has stayed back in Karachi, Monseigneur...

364
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,820
Ask her.

365
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,670
Tell me,

366
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:55,177
What was he like when he'd come to Karachi?

367
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,890
He'd not kill a cockroach in his room.

368
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,740
He'd just pick it up and leave it outside.

369
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,620
And now, when he started killing,

370
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,900
He killed people...

371
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,180
Have him stand in the witnss box and ask him this.

372
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,240
He must have an answer.

373
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,170
You may not like his answer,

374
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:25,877
But please, for once, listen to it.

375
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,070
Monseigneur's right,

376
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,770
But --

377
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,770
It's up to you...

378
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,070
I've gone through a full heart attack

379
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,040
Before coming here, Ruqaiyya Begum.

380
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,970
I've got the courage!

381
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:47,290
Let him stand with his arms crossed!

382
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,640
Let him accost

383
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,997
The father inside me!

384
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,610
But I'm not going to change.

385
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,750
You don't yield.

386
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,150
You just shatter.

387
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,570
What do you mean?

388
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,900
Don't forget, Reverend,

389
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,960
The Reverend has been bitterly defeated in this battle between a Reverend and a father.

390
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:23,210
I have seen the Reverend succumb and fall at the father's feet with my own eyes.

391
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,310
Now,

392
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:33,200
If you'd grab the father by the throat the moment you've come to,

393
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,860
The life will ebb out of a helpless mother.

394
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:43,450
Now, she's being sentimental to blackmail me.

395
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,970
But --
-But nothing, Reverend.

396
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,260
Be blackmailed.

397
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,790
Let him meet his sister and mother,

398
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,900
And when it's your turn,

399
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,170
You may look the other way.

400
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:03,061
Monseigneur, his honour has been tainted forever!

401
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:09,590
He'd regain his lost honour if he set foot inside his home.

402
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,340
What are you talking about, Monseigneur?

403
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,690
Honour is not a trifle that's lost and won like that.

404
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,970
It is gained on the condition of maintaining integrity

405
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,190
And holding firm to all the pieces.

406
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,090
Alright.

407
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,500
If that's what pleases you, I'll send him back.

408
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,580
Now, Monseigneur, it isn't exactly something that you should be vexed with me over.

409
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,246
Wait.

410
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,910
Alright.

411
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,060
Have it your way.

412
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,360
But think carefully,

413
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,030
For you shall be held responsible for it,

414
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,660
And any associated sin or reward.

415
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,720
There's no question about any sin or reward, Reverend.

416
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,707
If it pleases the mother and daughter, I will be past the bridge to Paradise like the ignis fatuus.

417
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,250
Shut the door to my room.

418
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,790
And tell your mother

419
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,640
To not let him come here.

420
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,278
Enter your home in the Lord's name.

421
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:01,290
Be wary of your father.

422
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,680
Wary as in,

423
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,311
Just visible from afar.

424
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,000
Say the Lord's name.

425
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I did.

426
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,370
Come in, then.

427
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,720
If any of you has the time to, please give me a cup of tea.

428
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,300
Don't look there.

429
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,030
He'd gulp

430
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,920
Two cups in his fury.

431
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,226
I'll get you in a minute, Dad.

432
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,280
Surely, you can prepare tea?

433
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,370
Of course.

434
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,330
I make a real tidy brew.

435
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,170
Then, prepare one and take it to Dad.

436
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,200
It'll wash away all his fury.

437
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,630
Show me the kitchen.

438
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,597
Come.

439
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,610
You're saying Sunday?

440
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,670
Yes.

441
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,200
You've thought over it carefully?

442
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,460
Yes, I have.

443
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,100
What date is it on Sunday?

444
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,550
The 27th.

445
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,260
That's what you know, innit?

446
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,620
That Sunday is the 27th?

447
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,080
You're talking about the Sunday on the 27th, right?

448
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,170
Yes.

449
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,100
Alright.

450
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,080
Brace yourself.

451
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,640
You're getting married on Sunday.

452
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,480
There!

453
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,760
Your Dad's here too.

454
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,350
Sit down, Madame la mariée.

455
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,700
Where are you off to?

456
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,490
Sit here and try out this bolt of yours,

457
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,710
Your Dad tests his heart's mettle.

458
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,420
Why are you folks remembering me and my heart?

459
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,575
Please, Monseigneur, sit.

460
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,880
Congratulations.

461
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,000
Congratulations?

462
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,800
I mean,

463
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,350
What for?

464
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,606
Farah's getting married on Sunday.

465
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,600
It's her engagement on Sunday.

466
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
We'd planned her engagement,

467
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,830
But Mademoiselle's planned her marriage.

468
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,260
Are you in your senses?

469
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,360
Sunday's just around the corner!

470
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,730
You should worry about the corner she's got herself in!

471
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,977
Wait!

472
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,421
Sit here by my side.

473
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,790
Right, now, what's the problem?

474
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,300
N --

475
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,610
N -- n --

476
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,747
N -- n -- Nothing?

477
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:49,986
Tell me,

478
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,740
Who mentioned the marriage?

479
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,220
She did, Dad.

480
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,350
She got touched in the head back at the hospital,

481
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,880
And decided when we got here that she'd get married this Sunday.

482
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,540
This marriage is not possible, Dad.

483
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,540
I mean -- Not on this Sunday.

484
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,930
And who are you to say that?

485
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,720
No, I didn't say that.

486
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,220
Sibtain did.

487
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,290
He called and said, 'I'm very upset'.

488
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,960
Why is he upset?

489
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,560
He should be delighted.

490
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,110
Perhaps he's -- not ready for so much delight?

491
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,320
There's something else going on, Irsa.

492
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,370
Let it go on if it is!

493
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,270
I say, the date's fixed.

494
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,650
You'd better say, too,

495
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,340
'She'd be getting married this Sunday'.

496
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,330
'She'd be getting married this Sunday'. La fin!

497
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,386
Irsa!

498
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:47,440
Oh God, what is going on?

499
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,290
No idea.

500
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,250
But I can tell you, Dad,

501
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,121
Sibtain won't marry her.

502
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,976
Anybody except Afzal may come in.

503
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,987
It's you!

504
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,990
You've brought tea?

505
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,350
Splendid.

506
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,820
Working on your first day here?

507
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,886
Here.

508
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,557
I really wanted to have a nice brew.

509
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,476
You don't seem the type.

510
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,620
What type?

511
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,150
I mean,

512
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:14,450
You're so affectionate.

513
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:19,840
But it's rather well-known that you can get furious.

514
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,300
Ruqaiyya really says anything!

515
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,970
She didn't say a thing.

516
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,090
I've seen for myself.

517
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:34,110
You didn't let him in for an hour and a half,

518
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,530
And now, when he's come in, you're meeting everyone except him?

519
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,150
Won't it shatter his heart?

520
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,630
Do you know how many hearts he left shattered here?

521
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,070
Three of them were ours.

522
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,680
Leave Arifa and me,

523
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,180
Tell me, if a mother's heart shatters,

524
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,630
Whatever would be left there?

525
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,720
He's sitting with his head in her lap,

526
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,660
And she's running her fingers through his hair continuously.

527
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,320
She fears him now.

528
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,960
Earlier, she'd whack him at the slightest!

529
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,980
Oh!

530
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:23,030
The blighter's affrighted her, too.

531
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,690
You'll see

532
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,110
How she dotes on him now!

533
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,060
She would

534
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,490
Be vexed with me for him!

535
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,020
She's right like a cauldron.

536
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,370
She'd tilt over to his side

537
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,380
The moment one gets into a row with her sweet child!

538
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,070
In all honesty,

539
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:55,560
I've grown weary of the politics of love.

540
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,220
Do you know, this heart attack I had,

541
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,420
This wretched heart

542
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,929
Has belittled me before Ruqaiyya.

543
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,780
You understand what I mean by 'belittled', don't you?

544
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,240
Yes.

545
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,280
The same way you've belittled me.

546
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,470
Wait!

547
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,830
Stop!

548
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:30,181
You're vexed with me over the first cup of tea on your first day here!

549
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,480
Call his mother's 'Excellent One' [Afzal] here.

550
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,256
But tell him

551
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:42,717
He has two minutes.

552
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,510
Hey -- Farah!

553
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,800
Where are you off to?

554
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,720
W --

555
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,870
Where would I go?

556
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,640
It just occurred to me

557
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,060
That I'd never congratulated Jasmine over her engagement because of the Reverend.

558
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,570
If nothing else,

559
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,920
I have a sort of a friendship with her.

560
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
Right...

561
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,460
You're chums with her.

562
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,160
And

563
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,950
I'd give her Uncle Reverend's ring too.

564
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,650
I'll say, 'This one was made for you',

565
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,400
'But ended up with me'.

566
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,380
That's it?

567
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,670
That's it, as in?

568
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,670
Won't you congratulate Afzal?

569
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,370
Yes,

570
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,980
If he -- came across, I'd -- congratulate him, too.

571
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,700
Splendid!

572
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,090
You have such a big heart!

573
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,870
Are you coming along?

574
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,960
No way!

575
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,148
I can't witness such spectacles!

576
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,322
Wait -- Listen!

577
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,540
Don't mention that --

578
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,810
You're getting married on Sunday.

579
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,670
Why?

580
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,280
Mum will, of course.

581
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,945
Leave such chores to her.

582
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,769
May I come in, Dad?

583
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,490
You have two minutes; that's all you have.

584
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,830
And, for these two minutes,

585
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:16,000
Stay at an arm's length from me.

586
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
