1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,908
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:19,111
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:24,176
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:30,629
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,142
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,142 --> 00:00:40,672
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,789
Why are you taking me along?

8
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,050
Who'd go and knock the door?

9
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,371
Why me?

10
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,320
This.

11
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,464
This is how you knock a door.

12
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:27,517
And what if the Reverend greets me?

13
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:28,512
So what?

14
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:30,626
He'd hit me here with his shoe!

15
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:35,025
He'll say, 'There is no power but God's! What are you doing here, you gambler'?

16
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,925
So you gamble for real?

17
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,145
No!

18
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:39,602
I play matches.

19
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:42,756
The Reverend thinks it's gambling.

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,617
There he is...

21
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:52,133
Look!

22
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:56,578
If we win the match,

23
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,448
I'll give you one grand!

24
00:01:58,448 --> 00:02:00,469
One grand?

25
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:05,597
Turned tail at the sight of me, eh bugger?

26
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,654
I'm your friend!

27
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,087
You're no friend of mine.

28
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,754
You're a sworn enemy!

29
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,694
My reputation has been besmirched because of you!

30
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:15,494
Have some shame, bleedin' bugger! I've earned you thousands --
-<i>I</i> have earned them!

31
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:18,085
Such 'earnings' repulse me now!

32
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,167
Alright -- One last time...

33
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:21,559
What?

34
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,789
A match with the old colony lads...

35
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:25,734
You bugger!

36
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,522
We're playing for 100,000.

37
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,492
So?

38
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:30,184
I'll give you 50.

39
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,756
That's five months' pay, you blighter!

40
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:34,735
It's about time Dad came

41
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:37,224
And I swear by you, he passes by this road everyday.

42
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,479
Just say yes and I'm leaving.

43
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,993
Have some shame.

44
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,528
Read the Qur'an.

45
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,553
Do you think

46
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,004
I haven't read it?

47
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,018
Go and read the commandment about gambling.

48
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,270
The ground beneath you will begin to tremble!

49
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,069
You --

50
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,761
Just pray that I win a big one.

51
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,895
I swear, I'll go on the pilgrimage.

52
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:55,937
Then listen to Dad's judgement too,

53
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:58,270
He said, 'Your friend Babloo is a sinner'!

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,703
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:01,613
You want that I lose the match!

56
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:03,595
I want that you win.

57
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:05,351
But just win the match.

58
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,029
A victory in gambling is your defeat.

59
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,072
Your Dad's bewitched you for sure.

60
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,093
You're betraying your friend!

61
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,334
One who supports gambling is no friend, Babloo.

62
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:19,537
Don't talk about loyalty to me.

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,190
What

64
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,173
Was this last line you said?

65
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,109
Dad --

66
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,233
Babloo was saying --

67
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,564
I heard the rest.

68
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:59,531
Repeat the last line.

69
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,076
Which one?

70
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,600
The one about loyalty.

71
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,181
I was saying --

72
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:08,000
'One who supports gambling is no friend'.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,247
'Don't talk about loyalty to me'.

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,855
I will go straight to Hazrat Sahab's grave,

75
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:21,365
And tell him,

76
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,168
'My Afzal'

77
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:26,317
'Has become a great man'.

78
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:30,219
He'll be enlivened to hear this!

79
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,037
I've found out about that girl.

80
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,755
Who?

81
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:14,728
The one who writes letters to him.

82
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,813
Who is she?

83
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,238
I won't tell you her name.

84
00:05:19,238 --> 00:05:21,260
So where's the news for me?

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,709
I already know about the letters.

86
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,751
I don't know the who.

87
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,306
What do I tell you, Mum!

88
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:29,768
It's all been going on sub rosa!

89
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,153
If love is blossoming between the two for real,

90
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:35,719
You could say a storm is brewing up!

91
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,182
Why?

92
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:39,768
Is she disreputable?

93
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,530
He is. Very disreputable.

94
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,141
Your 'most excellent one' [Afzal]!

95
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:46,925
Do you want to give me a heart attack?

96
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,053
No, Mum!

97
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,952
You'd be delighted to hear it.

98
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:52,768
I've had a heart attack.

99
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:53,748
Let me recover.

100
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:55,958
Then I'll talk to you.

101
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,348
What are you doing here?

102
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:39,413
Waiting for you to wake up.

103
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,912
Everything alright?

104
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:46,930
Mum said, 'Wait by her until she wakes up, and bring her along the moment she does'.

105
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:49,460
Reason being?

106
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,769
He called.

107
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,062
Who?

108
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,348
Your Afzal.

109
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,559
He asked when he'd be meeting Dad.

110
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,118
Why is he so impatient?

111
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,053
It's just yesterday that he had a scorching fever!

112
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,075
The fever's worn off,

113
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:16,048
And Mum's asked how he is countless times since the morning.

114
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:18,542
'I saw him sneeze myself'.

115
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,011
'He was shivering too'.

116
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:21,397
And so on...

117
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:22,953
Then, I told Mum

118
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:26,247
That he's ready to meet Dad.

119
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,603
Good Lord...

120
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,835
Well, it's all favourable to me so far...

121
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,860
It's happening exactly as I'd thought.

122
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,707
And may what is unthought of never happen.

123
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:40,855
And it's highly likely

124
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,968
That it'll come to be as I'm thinking it will.

125
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:44,390
What are you thinking?

126
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,848
Don't ask.

127
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,986
They say you should fear the possibility

128
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:51,405
Of something bad coming true when you say it.

129
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,587
Come now.

130
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:58,554
I'll freshen up first.

131
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,663
At least tell me.

132
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:02,364
Tell you what?

133
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:03,950
What does he like?

134
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,402
Meat or beef?

135
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,373
Or just fruits like you?

136
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:11,285
Mum's asked for two kinds of fish to be cooked.

137
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:15,902
But she said she'd prepare the lentils and vegetables only after asking you.

138
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,736
Is he coming today?

139
00:08:17,736 --> 00:08:18,930
No.

140
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,632
Not today.

141
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,848
But he'll come one of these days.

142
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:24,560
Then what is the meaning of this?

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,718
All these preparations?

144
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:29,252
The thing is, you'd vowed to offer a hundred additional prayers,

145
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,335
But you've been spared after a mere 12.

146
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:33,195
Your wish will be fulfilled.

147
00:08:33,195 --> 00:08:36,186
The meeting with Dad has a ceremonial touch to it, sweetheart.

148
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,761
Then, it'll be Reverend Subhanallah

149
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:40,174
And Aunt Ruqaiyya's turn.

150
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,078
Oh God...

151
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,857
Thank God!

152
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:46,382
No one has been so successful in love before!

153
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:49,734
I'll say that the lentils be cooked in the finest clarified butter,

154
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,756
And any vegetable will do.

155
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:54,107
For God's sake, wait!

156
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:55,387
I can't wait.

157
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:59,195
Mum's grey cells are working at full efficiency!

158
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,140
And may what is unthought of never happen.

159
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,671
And it's highly likely

160
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,467
That it'll come to be as I'm thinking it will.

161
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,587
They say you should fear the possibility

162
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,680
Of something bad coming true when you say it.

163
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,796
Shall I say it for tomorrow?

164
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:22,771
Yes.

165
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,449
But if it rains tomorrow, he should come the day after.

166
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,491
Why would it rain tomorrow?

167
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,695
The poor lad gets a fever in the rains.

168
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,015
This is why I get worried.

169
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,454
Shall I invite him for dinner?

170
00:09:34,454 --> 00:09:36,192
Yes, invite him for dinner.

171
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:39,702
But have him eat something before the meeting.

172
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:44,394
He won't have a bite if something provoked his ire.

173
00:09:45,036 --> 00:09:48,414
But why are <i>you</i> talking about all of this?

174
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,572
Because she's sleeping.

175
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:52,204
How much longer will she sleep?

176
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:56,129
She's vowed to wake up to good news.

177
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,283
This isn't new, Lubna.

178
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:01,028
Now, she vows to do something ever so often.

179
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:03,008
Have you watched Aina ('The Mirror')?

180
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,532
As in, the film?

181
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:07,336
The one with Shabnam and Nadeem?

182
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:08,783
Yes.

183
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,912
I've watched it thrice!

184
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:13,798
Your Dad cried while watching it.

185
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:16,846
The same story is going on here.

186
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:19,344
My Dad bears an uncanny resemblance to Shabnam's!

187
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,787
No way!

188
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,683
Your Dad is very soft-hearted.

189
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:24,871
Shall I tell her then?

190
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,609
Tell her what?

191
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,392
'Wake up, you're about to get good news'!

192
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:31,053
Hold it there.

193
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:35,162
There's a difference between weeping over a film and marrying off one's daughter.

194
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:38,139
It frightens me to think, Lubna,

195
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,863
The poor girl will have the previous night's leftovers for breakfast.

196
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:43,640
Anyway,

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,492
Leave it to God's will.

198
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:50,692
For now, go and tell her when he's coming.

199
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,180
Dad thinks I've become a great man

200
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,011
Because I refused Babloo's 50,000.

201
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:52,704
Because 25 years ago, his Hazrat Sahab had seated me in his lap and said,

202
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,248
'Subhanallah'!

203
00:11:54,248 --> 00:11:56,443
'Your son will grow to become a great man one day'!

204
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,125
Very good, mate.

205
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,041
You've been scoring a third division all throughout.

206
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,530
But I...

207
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,410
I've failed my BA four times.

208
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,367
That makes me a greater man.

209
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,056
I know I can never become a great man.

210
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:14,623
I couldn't even be a puny clerk.

211
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,089
I lost the job I got thanks to Dad on the second day

212
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,181
And I lack the courage to tell Dad...

213
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:28,100
I leave everyday with this untruthful tie,

214
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,565
And Dad is so delighted to see this...

215
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,408
Hey!

216
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:34,415
And where'd you get this cell phone from?

217
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,466
And where did yesterday's suit and boots come from?

218
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,571
Someone's asked me to feign love for four months.

219
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:44,251
She bought everything.

220
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,820
And she's paying me 200,000 every month for it.

221
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,046
You've hit the jackpot, you bugger!

222
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:52,750
He's selling his conscience out, you blighter!

223
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,890
To the Devil with conscience!

224
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,796
He'll be earning 800,000 in four months!

225
00:12:57,796 --> 00:13:00,058
He can buy back the honour he sold.

226
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:02,476
What will you tell her?

227
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:03,711
Who?

228
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:07,491
The one whose letters you read out to us.
-Leave it be, mate. Easy there.

229
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,665
This news ain't flashing on your TV screens.

230
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,510
Keep it up, Afzal.

231
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,106
With 800,000 bucks,

232
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:14,497
Nobody will ask you

233
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:18,043
If your conscience is alive or dead.

234
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,917
I was thinking of the same.
-Splendid.

235
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,076
Think of it,

236
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:29,331
And work on it.

237
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,026
No.

238
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm thinking I won't take the money.

239
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,566
Are you touched in the head, bleeding bugger?

240
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:40,790
Who leaves the money that was agreed upon?

241
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,407
Who charges any money to love?

242
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,054
At least be happy now.

243
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:55,265
He's meeting your father tomorrow.

244
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,873
And your father will call to decline Mehtab today.

245
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:03,963
What does that mean?

246
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:06,645
Don't ask what it means.

247
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:09,717
I mean, are you going to accept him?

248
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:13,583
We'll find out after the meeting.

249
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:18,139
What are your intentions?

250
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,612
Last night, your father was watching an old film of Mithun's.

251
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,346
Which one?

252
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,080
'Pyar Jhukta Nahin' (Love Never Capitulates)

253
00:14:28,596 --> 00:14:31,157
You're going to accept him?

254
00:14:31,157 --> 00:14:32,904
You're unnerved as if

255
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:36,165
Your own intentions are changing.

256
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,715
N -- No!

257
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:40,012
I'm chuffed.

258
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,312
But --

259
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:43,781
You should be in a right mard.

260
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:45,184
Take some time --

261
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,900
Then agree to it.

262
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,307
At this rate, he'll think --

263
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:50,065
Farah was just helplessly waiting to be taken.

264
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,545
Only you <i>are</i> helplessly waiting to be taken!

265
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:55,329
When word gets out in the neighbourhood,

266
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:58,664
The girl is left helplessly waiting to be taken, so to speak.

267
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,759
Alright, don't change your intentions now.

268
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,178
Let what is ordained by God happen.

269
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,465
Alright, tell me

270
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:09,663
Does the Reverend know about it?

271
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,755
I don't know.

272
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:16,305
He will get to know today.

273
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:17,784
How?

274
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,432
Your father said he'll offer his evening prayers there.

275
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:25,591
Dad will go to the Mosque to tell him?

276
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,920
Anything auspicious should start there.

277
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,330
For God's sake, Mum,

278
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,040
Why are you in such haste?

279
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,642
This is but natural, my dear.

280
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,190
If the girl's eager to love,

281
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,507
The parents are eager to get her married off.

282
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:44,165
By the way, why are you getting worried?

283
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:47,157
He will agree to what you say.

284
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:48,767
Agree to what?

285
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,710
The same

286
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,966
About going to London for your MPhil.

287
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,825
In fact, he can go along.

288
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:56,507
He'll get to visit London too!

289
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,975
That's been decided already. Why don't you tell her, Farah?

290
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,282
He was delighted to hear that he's getting a chance to visit London!

291
00:16:02,282 --> 00:16:03,476
There.

292
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:06,036
You better not tell your Dad about it!

293
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,844
Or else it'll be the first question when he meets him.

294
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:09,816
And if

295
00:16:09,816 --> 00:16:12,692
He says, 'Alright',

296
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:15,211
'I'll get to visit London too'!

297
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:17,070
Then, God willing,

298
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,168
He won't have the chance to get you!

299
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:35,630
[Prayer for blessings and goodness in times of calamity]

300
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,805
Afzal!

301
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,996
Why are you sitting here?

302
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:45,662
Come in.

303
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,751
Are you well?

304
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:05,383
Yes. Never been better.

305
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,929
The fever's weakened you.

306
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,146
It's not weakness, Mum.

307
00:19:13,146 --> 00:19:16,000
He's hiding something that he's ashamed of.

308
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,188
Tell me.

309
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,765
I'm right, am I not?

310
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,016
Hold it, Arifa!

311
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,027
Alright.

312
00:19:27,317 --> 00:19:28,968
I'll hold it.

313
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,508
Tell me, now.

314
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,760
Should I get you some yahni for your weakness,

315
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,556
Or chant an incantation for your depression?

316
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:40,711
Be ashamed of yourself if you are, Monsieur Afzal.

317
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,710
Spare yourself and tell the truth!

318
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,632
What's the worst that can happen?

319
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:45,846
Dad will curse you,

320
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:46,983
Mum will slap you.

321
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,361
I'd weep when I hear it.

322
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,480
But why should I weep again?

323
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,541
I've wept once already.

324
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,905
Say that you're not a clerk anymore.

325
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,840
To be precise, say that you're not even a clerk now.

326
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:09,230
Swear on my life if I'm lying.

327
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,976
Wager my head again if you like!

328
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,929
Say that she's mistaken!

329
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,628
It's all just unfounded suspicions!

330
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:27,656
Say something, my brother.

331
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:30,979
Or shall I have your Mum talk to your Mr Chengezi?

332
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,819
She'd believe it if he told her.

333
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,350
Forgive me

334
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,223
It occurred to me yesterday that I'd conceal it,

335
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,697
But I thought while praying in the afternoon

336
00:20:52,697 --> 00:20:55,070
If I started concealing truths about you from Mum and Dad,

337
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,844
It would make me no better than you!

338
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,958
A fibber!

339
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:03,650
And then, it occurred to me during my evening prayer

340
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,897
That you're not evil,

341
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:08,461
You're the most vile and dastardly, Afzal!

342
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,990
Listen to the truth now.

343
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,920
A girl named Rosy worked there.

344
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,051
He's been ousted for harassing her.

345
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,806
His leaving every morning, wearing his trousers and shirt, with a tie,

346
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:30,475
He just pretends before us that he's going to office!

347
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:37,470
He's actually into something dodgy that's got him a mobile worth 40,000 in 4 days!

348
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,645
Tell me...

349
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,093
Please, tell me

350
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,257
That she's just told a lie...

351
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,840
She just told the truth, Mum...

352
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,993
But the truth isn't like what she's said it --

353
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,598
You blighter!

354
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,392
You're right in saying I'm no longer a clerk,

355
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:00,836
But everything else is a lie.

356
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,807
I swear by you.

357
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,280
Believe everything you like,

358
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,483
But never believe that your brother could harass a girl,

359
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:20,689
Nor think that I'd do anything Dad would think of as sinful.

360
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,020
This phone

361
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,641
Someone's given me this.

362
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,781
I've also gotten a new suit and ties.

363
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:35,745
They've hired me for a job.

364
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:37,461
But it isn't a job,

365
00:23:37,461 --> 00:23:39,767
It's a trial for me.

366
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,683
And to emerge triumphant in this trial,

367
00:23:42,683 --> 00:23:45,427
I'm staging a spectacle with them.

368
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:47,790
It's supposed to take four months,

369
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,340
But I've got a feeling it'll only take four weeks.

370
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,445
I'll look for a job then.

371
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:16,090
I concealed it from Mum and Dad because they were very happy

372
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,256
And I didn't want to ruin their happiness.

373
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:23,218
Why didn't you tell me?

374
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,984
You were happy too!

375
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:31,112
I realised today that you can be more furious than Dad!

376
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:35,309
You could've asked for once before creating a scene!

377
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,589
Still, I'm not angry with you.

378
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,393
I'm pleased to see your fury.

379
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,493
You've blown me to bits.

380
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:50,527
And if you're embarrassed, don't let it show up on your face.

381
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:51,970
And your tears

382
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,343
Are like Miss Rosy's accusations.

383
00:24:56,583 --> 00:25:00,403
They can rattle my world.

384
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,930
What is it now?

385
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,556
Nothing at all.

386
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:38,741
What do you mean?

387
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:42,428
Everything I told you was a lie!

388
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,822
Just one bit was true, Mum.

389
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,199
He's left his job --

390
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,774
But you're under my oath, please don't tell Dad!

391
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,333
He's found another job.

392
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:54,269
He's working there.

393
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,268
Peace be upon you, Dad.

394
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:09,758
And upon you, peace.

395
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,805
Everything alright, sire?

396
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:17,717
You came to answer the door today!

397
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,622
I wanted to meet you

398
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:21,218
Talk to you...

399
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,580
Peace be upon you, Dad.

400
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,846
And upon you, peace.

401
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,908
[Begin] in God's name.

402
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,727
What is it?

403
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,027
It's nothing really --

404
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:30,769
Just --

405
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:32,828
Someone had bought him a new mobile, so he was saying,

406
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,285
'I'd ask permission of Dad'.

407
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,784
'I'll ask if I can keep it'.

408
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:40,943
Has it been purchased through rightful means?

409
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,915
100%.

410
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,374
You've brought it?

411
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,463
Yes.

412
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:50,567
Why are you asking me if you've brought it?

413
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:51,939
Now,

414
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:55,040
Don't ask me about these trifles.

415
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,561
Let the Reverend

416
00:27:56,561 --> 00:27:59,260
Remain at the Mosque.

417
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,708
Just don't do that

418
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,670
Which you would be ashamed to do.

419
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,987
Has someone gifted it?

420
00:28:09,297 --> 00:28:10,841
Yes.

421
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,262
How say you give something in return too?

422
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,660
Who's gifted it?

423
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,193
Will you ask everything now?

424
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:28,069
'Let the Reverend remain'...
-Alright.

425
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,888
Alright, now, tell me

426
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:40,590
How are you?

427
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,821
I'm fine, Dad.

428
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,208
Ah, yes...

429
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,229
Monseigneur

430
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:46,510
Showed up

431
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,497
Today.

432
00:28:48,786 --> 00:28:50,909
After his evening prayers,

433
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,076
He stayed with me for quite some time.

434
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:54,943
We

435
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,731
Kept on talking about this world and the next.

436
00:28:57,731 --> 00:29:01,526
It seems he's very pleased with you.

437
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:04,782
'Someday', he said as he left,

438
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:08,744
'Come along with Madame to our place'.

439
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:11,331
What did you say, then?

440
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:13,917
I said, 'Certainly, why not'?

441
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:17,681
There's one thing I like very much about him

442
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:21,557
He always sits at the back when offering his prayers.

443
00:29:21,557 --> 00:29:23,700
People like him

444
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,592
Only believe in God's greatness

445
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,421
And not their own.

446
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,291
So will you pay him a visit?

447
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:34,690
Sure, if he asked with such mesmerising emphasis again!

448
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,850
Don't worry

449
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,020
I'll call Lubna and ask her to stop her father.

450
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,570
Stop him from doing what?

451
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,182
Stressing that Dad pay a visit!

452
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,040
Won't it all come out in the open if Dad went there?

453
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,134
Yes...

454
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,983
That's right...

455
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,041
Here's a surprise for you.

456
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,888
How many surprises have you in store for me?

457
00:29:55,888 --> 00:29:58,337
This is the final one.

458
00:29:58,561 --> 00:29:59,820
Go on.

459
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,850
I've also found out about the girl who writes you letters.

460
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,385
Tell me who she is.

461
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,076
I know her name, address, and lineage

462
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:09,014
But I'll never tell you!

463
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,029
Hello --

464
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,847
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur.

465
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:38,981
And upon you, peace.

466
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:42,210
I'd been eagerly awaiting your call.

467
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,681
Indeed, it took me a while to decide on it.

468
00:30:45,681 --> 00:30:49,106
The other day, Madame was talking about a decision too.

469
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:52,142
I'm getting worried by the very mention of it.

470
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:55,606
I would like to humbly request something of you.

471
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,756
Please be courageous enough to listen.

472
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,598
Is everything alright?

473
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:02,373
The thing is,

474
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,791
Our plan for the marriage,

475
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,279
The date we'd fixed and all,

476
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,951
Is no longer possible.

477
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,479
Excuse me.

478
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,083
What isn't possible?

479
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:23,884
Farah has rejected the proposal.

480
00:31:24,066 --> 00:31:25,011
What?

481
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:26,875
What's the matter?

482
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:30,182
She wants to continue her education.

483
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:31,757
And she

484
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:35,952
Isn't quite accepting of Mehtab.

485
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,152
Pardonne-moi, Monseigneur,

486
00:31:38,152 --> 00:31:40,455
She's lying.

487
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,386
She's got an affair going on.

488
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,646
It's a very old one.

489
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:47,734
They used to exchange letters and talk over the phone for hours.

490
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:50,548
But Mehtab had even forgiven this.

491
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,884
He shouldn't have.

492
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:56,612
When the girl says so much herself,

493
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:59,565
A gentleman should behave like one.

494
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:01,613
What do you mean?

495
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:06,190
I mean, I beg forgiveness of you,

496
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,048
And I'm remorseful for not being able to fulfil the promise I'd made my friend.

497
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:15,096
Your friend's dead, Monseigneur,

498
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:18,246
Only the living would feel any remorse.

499
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:19,800
Tell me

500
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,086
What will I say to those whom I've given the good news?

501
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:23,793
What will I say to my family,

502
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,724
Before whom I'd said proudly,

503
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:28,747
'My daughter-in-law won't be from the family for I'll fulfil the late Esquire's promise'!

504
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:31,887
Tell them it didn't come to fruition.

505
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,761
The girl's family reneged on their promise.

506
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:38,612
I, too, have to answer these questions, Madame.

507
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,948
But I do not fear it.

508
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:45,480
My family's honour isn't dearer to me than my daughter's life.

509
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,893
You're siding with her, Monseigneur; she's ensnared you in her sweet talk!

510
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:52,388
Stop the girl if she's taking a wrong step!

511
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,496
Don't back her!

512
00:32:54,496 --> 00:32:55,852
Look, Madame,

513
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:58,554
Don't say what is improper.

514
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:00,576
This decision grieves me too, but --

515
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:04,253
By the Lord, Monseigneur, think of how much it'd hurt Mehtab.

516
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:08,544
He'd vaunt his wife's qualities among his friends!

517
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:11,100
'How sweet she is', 'How good and chaste she is'!

518
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,843
May I speak freely?

519
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,357
This marriage is not possible.

520
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:17,835
<i>La fin!</i>

521
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:19,729
How can you '<i>La fin</i>' it like that, Monseigneur?

522
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:21,045
Is this a joke?

523
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:24,804
You'd fixed the date with us and you'd marry her off to someone else?

524
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:26,277
What if something happened to Mehtab?

525
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:28,054
Nothing will happen to him,

526
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:30,059
He'll feel a bit of sorrow,

527
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:31,970
And then he'll heal.

528
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,293
It happens, Madame.

529
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:37,020
Kids' wishes do vacillate sometimes.

530
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,798
Don't say such things, Monseigneur.

531
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,931
One should keep a close watch on daughters!

532
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,100
Leave my daughter,

533
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,146
And keep a watch on your son

534
00:33:45,146 --> 00:33:47,083
So that he may not do something!

535
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,642
Goodbye.

536
00:33:48,642 --> 00:33:51,269
But Monseigneur --

537
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,989
Farah?

538
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,591
You haven't slept again?

539
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:17,750
You've been up all night?

540
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,416
What is it <i>this time</i>?

541
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,010
Still alive?

542
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,297
Or dead?

543
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:29,473
Alright,

544
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:30,517
If you're dead,

545
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,742
Plummet right when I touch you.

546
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,347
And have no fear,

547
00:34:34,347 --> 00:34:37,770
The dead feel no pain.

548
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,526
May your enemies die! [ = 'What am I talking about'!]

549
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,597
Hello?

550
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:47,076
Where am I?

551
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,444
Platform #2,

552
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:53,533
And your train departs from Platform #1,

553
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:58,338
And, hopefully, by the time you come to your senses, your train would've left.

554
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,647
Where are you going?

555
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,806
Have some shame, Farah Ibrahim!

556
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:06,220
There are things in life besides plotting and politics!

557
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,106
For instance, I study at the University,

558
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,530
And I had to take a leave yesterday because of <i>you</i>!

559
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,847
You're going to University?

560
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:15,371
Any doubts?

561
00:35:15,371 --> 00:35:17,378
No doubts at all.

562
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:18,927
But I request you

563
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:20,806
Please don't go today.

564
00:35:20,806 --> 00:35:23,310
I'd made an excuse about how I could go alone yesterday,

565
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,680
But I'll go alone today!

566
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,998
Let go of my hand!

567
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,755
Please don't go...

568
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:30,843
All the talk about going to London for your MPhil,

569
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:32,330
And this is how your studies go -

570
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,064
Skiving off twice a week!

571
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,268
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

572
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,078
If you went today,

573
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,870
Dad will scold you.

574
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,299
Oh...

575
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,646
Dad will be delighted if you slouch about here,

576
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:46,481
He'll scold me if I go to University?

577
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,405
He'll say,

578
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:49,061
'Have some shame, my dear'.

579
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:52,322
'There are no classes on Sundays'.

580
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,252
It's Sunday?

581
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:00,989
Yes.

582
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,423
Where would you go today?

583
00:36:22,491 --> 00:36:25,641
The cricket ground by the old colony.

584
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,414
I'll go and sit there.

585
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:30,416
I have my lunch and answer your phone from there.

586
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:33,321
Which reminds me, my lunch box --

587
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,207
I say, don't go today.

588
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,147
Are you out of your mind?

589
00:36:38,147 --> 00:36:40,606
You'd have Dad beat me with his boots!

590
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:43,550
You'd be beaten with boots if you went.

591
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,949
Put a sock in it!

592
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:48,069
Dad will be delighted to see me.

593
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,070
Won't he be a bit worried

594
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,370
To find out you're off to work on a Sunday?

595
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,850
Take off your tie.

596
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,406
Dad's about to come out of his room.

597
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:20,481
Our complot shall end today!

598
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:21,782
He'll pay a visit tonight,

599
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,387
Have dinner with Dad,

600
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:26,156
And Dad will say, after a solemn meeting,

601
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:27,256
'Alright, my son',

602
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:28,614
'You pass my trials'.

603
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,748
'Bring your parents now'.

604
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,890
That's it!

605
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:33,724
The plot ends

606
00:37:33,724 --> 00:37:36,183
And the politics begins.

607
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:38,657
Ever thought about how to go about this politics?

608
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,933
What do you think?

609
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,817
I've been awake for nights for sheer amusement?

610
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:43,051
I've thought it out.

611
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:44,988
Thought over every aspect.

612
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:47,580
And I've come to the conclusion

613
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,968
That Dad will accept him.

614
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:51,422
By the Lord, Farah,

615
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:53,296
Even the blind can see that.

616
00:37:53,296 --> 00:37:54,846
They can see it, sure,

617
00:37:54,846 --> 00:37:57,873
But they won't see a thing.

618
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,883
Confused?

619
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:01,144
Listen, then.

620
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:03,848
He won't come here in the first place.

621
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:04,597
What?

622
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:05,786
Are you insane?

623
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:07,938
He's eager to meet Dad.

624
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:10,200
To the dickens with <i>him</i>!

625
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,459
And Dad?

626
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:12,950
What will you tell him?

627
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,900
He asked the moment he came back yesterday,

628
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,347
'So, Irsa, he's coming tomorrow, isn't he'?

629
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:20,847
To add to it, Mum's preparations --
-Will all go to waste.

630
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:23,326
So you'll stop him.

631
00:38:23,326 --> 00:38:24,400
Is that it?

632
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,951
Yes!

633
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:27,312
Won't Dad ask?

634
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,831
Will he keep waiting for him at dinner?

635
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:31,767
You're so intelligent!

636
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,098
It took me an entire night to think through this,

637
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:36,009
And you caught up so fast!

638
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,299
Wow!

639
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:38,673
May I pick up?

640
00:38:38,673 --> 00:38:39,493
Please!

641
00:38:39,493 --> 00:38:41,159
I'd concede your greatness!

642
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,620
Good Lord, it's written all over you.

643
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,690
Everyone will be waiting but he'll never show up.

644
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,348
If he's supposed to come at 9 p.m., he'd switch off his phone at 8.30.

645
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:52,100
Dad will ask where he is,

646
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,550
Mum will be left staring at you,

647
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,130
And you'd hide your face in embarrassment.

648
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:56,574
And when it's 10,

649
00:38:56,574 --> 00:39:00,940
You'd shed a few counterfeit tears, and run upstairs with evident distress! Innit?

650
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,790
Hey!

651
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,334
Bullseye!

652
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:05,336
How do you figure it all out?

653
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:09,878
Because I've watched all those films with you.

654
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,599
I suppose you haven't thought of anything else?

655
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:14,940
Why should I?

656
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,820
If he didn't show up, Dad will think,

657
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,813
'What an uncouth bounder'!

658
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,687
'He'll only make my daughter weep'.

659
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,897
Your script sounds nice so far,

660
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:26,748
But everything after it will be far from theatrical, and Dad will present it before you!

661
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:28,618
When I'm running the show,

662
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:30,904
Everything will happen as I like it!

663
00:39:30,904 --> 00:39:32,474
Stay tuned,

664
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,334
I've got such a thrilling finale planned,

665
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,259
It'll make your head go round!

666
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,290
You'd be left asking me for months,
