1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,910
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,103
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:24,270
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,655
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:36,170
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,830
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,566
What'll you wear, Reverend?

8
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:10,091
You think about it, Ruqaiyya Begum.

9
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:12,470
I will

10
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,600
Wear the same I did for Bakrid [feast of the sacrifice].

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,330
Why that one?

12
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,730
Why don't you talk about the other Eid [feast]?

13
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,680
I'm a believer, Ma'am.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,790
I believe in being the foremost in sacrifice.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,736
Are you attending a sacrifice ritual?

16
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,186
When

17
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:35,496
Suspicion mixes with happiness,

18
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,200
One should be prepared.

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,930
Any moment

20
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,990
May be the moment of the sacrifice.

21
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,010
What kind of suspicion?

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,871
Just...

23
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:51,290
But

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:55,117
I believe in God's mercy.

25
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:58,916
That's why I'm firm.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,296
I'm just thinking why Monseigneur Ibrahim didn't call himself.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,371
He sent his message; that's how it is.

28
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,148
And then,

29
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,382
When it's all done and over with,

30
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:17,368
There'll be no need for any calls.

31
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:19,973
Pay a visit in person.

32
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:23,592
In fact, take him along too.

33
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:26,390
That'll do good to both.

34
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,970
You'll get to meet [them],

35
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,290
And he'll get to see [her].

36
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,440
I'll never let that be.

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,437
We were engaged for four years,

38
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:43,038
And Dad had ordered that Subhanallah not pass through our street!

39
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,650
This here...

40
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,382
Are you getting even or

41
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:52,276
Guarding the tradition?

42
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:55,596
Whatever you think it is.

43
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:59,386
But the tradition wasn't wrong, Reverend.

44
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:01,491
Dad used to say,

45
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,190
'A gentleman's son should be the bee's knees',

46
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,966
'Not a bumbling bee'!

47
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,587
Have you ever asked me

48
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:11,916
How I spent those four years?

49
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,110
Will asking this bring them back?

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,346
It's okay.

51
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:21,711
They went by.

52
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,476
You remained over there,

53
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:28,410
And we over here.

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,156
Right...

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,151
You've had row with Lubna?

56
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,116
Why --

57
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,037
Why would I have a row with Lubna?

58
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:01,288
How did you suddenly feel that you love Farah?

59
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,458
Felt as in?

60
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:06,598
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

61
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:08,758
Why would I?

62
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:11,123
And what would I hide?

63
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:14,074
You don't love Farah.

64
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,810
Alright.

65
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,416
So you'd tell me I don't love Farah.

66
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,557
Okay.

67
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:23,760
Then whom do I love?

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,546
Lubna.

69
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:26,457
Hey!

70
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:27,920
For God's sake,

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,230
I haven't even thought of her.

72
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,210
You're lying.

73
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,657
I saw that she was calling you and I answered it once too!

74
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:36,650
And I remember what I'd heard very well.

75
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,730
Not right!

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,970
And is it right that you're stuck on Lubna but want to marry Farah?

77
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,406
Hey -- Ask forgiveness of God, Arifa.

78
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:46,156
Am I that type?

79
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:50,197
That's what one cannot know - what type you are!

80
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:52,206
Alright.

81
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,117
Swear on my life.

82
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:54,920
Tell me

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,820
Farah is the one who used to write you letters, right?

84
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,396
I won't.

85
00:04:58,396 --> 00:04:59,377
There.

86
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:00,987
You're lying, aren't you?

87
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:03,634
I don't need to swear on your life to tell the truth!

88
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:07,236
I'm saying it. Why not accept it as the truth?

89
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,470
Does the sight of cooking alert you too, now?

90
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,457
Poltroon!

91
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,022
Clean the dishes thoroughly. Make sure they're dry.

92
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,126
Let me see.

93
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,130
Peace be upon you, Mum.

94
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,320
And upon you, peace.

95
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,410
Lave your face and hands and freshen up.

96
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,031
Have your lunch; you won't have time later.

97
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:34,917
Are we expecting guests?

98
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:37,108
I asked something, Mum...

99
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,978
Just look at what you're asking!

100
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,728
Don't you know who's coming?

101
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:45,969
Good Lord, how do I know who's coming?

102
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,146
Would you look at what you're saying!

103
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:59,571
Servants are like family.

104
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,419
They'll think you change your mind like a chameleon does colours!

105
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,375
Will you keep on saying these things or tell me who's coming?

106
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,830
Are you out of your mind?

107
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,460
The same, again?

108
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,286
I'm just asking

109
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:14,367
Who is to be welcomed like this?

110
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,848
Oh God...

111
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:19,307
Anyway, freshen up; we'll talk later.

112
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,190
Talk about what?

113
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,298
I'm asking you a simple question.

114
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,940
Why are you so hesitant in answering it?

115
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,540
Do <i>I</i> have to tell you his name?

116
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,421
I'm not asking his address, after all!
-Remember this, Farah.

117
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:35,162
If you keep on saying these things, I'll grab something and smite my head with it.

118
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,098
Who's coming?

119
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,919
Someone's coming?

120
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,160
Go and check out in the kitchen.

121
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,766
All those cates --

122
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,656
The servants, the maid, the cook --

123
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,519
They're all busy with it.

124
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:15,447
Who could it be?

125
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,374
You tell me.

126
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,997
I've tired of asking Mum.

127
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,078
She's not ready to tell me.

128
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:23,210
A friend of Dad's, maybe?

129
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,878
No friend of Dad's.

130
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,739
Someone we know.

131
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,518
Someone we know will be coming,

132
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:30,249
And we haven't the foggiest.

133
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,789
Find out.

134
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:32,821
Go, Lubna!

135
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:34,769
Before this fear takes over me.

136
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:35,844
Don't send me.

137
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,675
I'm getting suspicious.

138
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,819
What kind of suspicion?

139
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,540
You're not getting good news.

140
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,207
To the dickens with bad news!

141
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,486
Oh, no way!

142
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:48,447
Can't be <i>him</i>!

143
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,700
You'd told him not to.

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,670
So,

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,541
Are you thinking the same?

146
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,872
I'm not thinking,

147
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,232
Just had a thought

148
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:59,152
That that's what's got you worried.

149
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,043
Let him show such audacity!

150
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,658
I'm going to feed him his teeth!

151
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,039
That's alright.

152
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,150
But what if the Reverend showed up?

153
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,400
But why would he?

154
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,842
He's your employee,

155
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:15,176
You pay him his salary.

156
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:18,066
And as per the contract --
-The contract...

157
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,750
Has been terminated.

158
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,496
He's been terminated, too.

159
00:09:21,496 --> 00:09:23,607
I'd texted him,

160
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,840
'Your work is done'.

161
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,220
'Meet Lubna and collect your cheque'.

162
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,496
That rules out the Reverend paying a visit!

163
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,426
Yes.

164
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:40,220
I'm getting worried for nothing.

165
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,760
Why would <i>he</i> come?

166
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,371
Why would the Reverend come?

167
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,616
Why would anyone from his family come?

168
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:49,316
Who, then?

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,847
I'm going to the barber's.

170
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:00,167
Alright.

171
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,127
I thought

172
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:13,628
When I saw the yellow gown

173
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:16,538
That it'd suit you.

174
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,577
Thank you.

175
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:24,367
Your 'thank you' seems to have more of thankfulness

176
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,477
Than affection.

177
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,091
I, too, find more farewells than welcomes in the soirée invitation.

178
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,842
Hold that, Ruqaiyya Begum!

179
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:41,297
What's this twattle on such an auspicious day?

180
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:44,162
Seek God's counsel on it if you like.

181
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,762
I already have.

182
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:49,972
The signs are very favourable.

183
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:53,752
Sit for a while.

184
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,087
Okay.

185
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,987
Right here.

186
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,042
How could the signs be favourable?

187
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,770
The girl has changed here.

188
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,116
What?

189
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,586
She's not the one

190
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:13,712
Who used to write him letters.

191
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:15,531
Is it?

192
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,527
But how does it make any difference?

193
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,086
Does saying your afternoon prayers at daybreak make a difference?

194
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:24,470
Fear God, Ruqaiyya Begum!

195
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,416
You're mixing up everything!

196
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,586
It is also required of you to fear God.

197
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:34,356
Do not blaspheme against love by calling this good.

198
00:12:34,356 --> 00:12:37,236
The same condition applies here:

199
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,726
You must honour your love

200
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:42,276
For the one you love, or you are a sinner.

201
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,287
Ask him

202
00:12:44,287 --> 00:12:47,966
If his lover and his betrothed are not one and the same, say to him,

203
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:50,800
'Your mother ordains a judgement against you'

204
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,567
'That you cannot live under the same roof as the faithful'.

205
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,126
Good Lord!

206
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:06,367
It's not just Mum,

207
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,780
Even the maids won't tell!

208
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,208
When I asked Sakina Mai,

209
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,928
Do you know how she stared at me?

210
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:15,079
As if I've said something outrageous!

211
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,486
Something's cooking...

212
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:24,607
Call Afzal!

213
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:26,536
So simple!

214
00:13:26,536 --> 00:13:27,807
Why couldn't you think of it earlier?

215
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,516
Give me your phone.

216
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,390
It's over there.

217
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,939
The two of you are sitting as if you really don't know a thing.

218
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:39,933
My dear,

219
00:13:39,933 --> 00:13:42,960
Marriage is a serious affair.

220
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,640
The girl's family has to show some fine conduct.

221
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,935
Show whom?

222
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,210
You'd better not say anything.

223
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,682
If only I could know when you're earnestly being reasonable!

224
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:54,718
And you!

225
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:57,583
I'll have a good look at you after they've left.

226
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,314
After who's left?

227
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,814
I'll whack you so hard!

228
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:06,034
What are the two of you wearing today?

229
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,014
What are we-- ?

230
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:07,825
Anyway.

231
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:10,058
Wear whatever you like.

232
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,890
It's 6 right now.

233
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,057
Yes...

234
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:17,193
You ought to be ready by 8.30 sharp.

235
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,224
Get ready for what?

236
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:22,475
You will come down instantly.

237
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,725
And she'll come when she's called.

238
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:25,811
And remember:

239
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,622
Nobody should hear you or see your face

240
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,583
Before you're called.

241
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,878
Are we clear?

242
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:34,587
Yes.

243
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:35,874
Clear...

244
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,985
And lower your gaze

245
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:39,330
As you come downstairs.

246
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,690
If they ask you two questions,

247
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,486
Answer one [don't speak too much].

248
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:46,516
And your coyness should be visible when you answer.

249
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:47,656
And yes,

250
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:50,870
You wouldn't happen to remember the third pious declaration, would you?

251
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,746
I do, Mum.
-Recite it if they ask you to; it'll do good to your father's honour.

252
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,479
Recite the third pious declaration.

253
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,536
[Recitation]

254
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,701
Try again.

255
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:33,920
Keep on trying

256
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,821
Until that blighter answers the phone and talks,

257
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,651
Please, keep on trying!

258
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,476
Now you know who's coming.

259
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,906
Ask Arifa.

260
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:05,762
Call her.

261
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:08,143
She'd be praying.

262
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,282
Where are you going?

263
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:16,956
I'll pray too.

264
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:18,405
Not just the obligatory ones,

265
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:19,990
But 12 additional prayers as well.

266
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,131
Let's see what happens then.
-What'll happen?

267
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:26,442
The blighter will burst into flames!

268
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,240
Listen.

269
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,590
Yes?

270
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,020
Tell your mother

271
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,510
To wear that yellow gown.

272
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,997
I'll be coming right after the night time prayers.

273
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,297
Yes, Dad.

274
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,757
And yes,

275
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:24,626
Tell her also

276
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:29,086
That she need not be concerned about it anymore,

277
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:32,230
For the outcome will be positive.

278
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,537
Positive, as in,

279
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:37,977
She need not have any doubts.

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,840
Go.

281
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,376
Do you know now who's coming?

282
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:08,035
Yes.

283
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,004
Care to explain the reason for that act?

284
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,875
Act?

285
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,989
Come here.

286
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,651
Go on.

287
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:29,327
To be honest, Mum, I think she's bogey.

288
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,776
What bogey?

289
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,222
As they say in the Emerald Isle!

290
00:19:36,222 --> 00:19:38,022
Why are you saying it here?

291
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:40,442
They say it in situations like these.

292
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:43,952
Say, when the girl changes her mind but you don't know why.

293
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,396
What's this you're saying?

294
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:47,177
You'd be furious,

295
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:48,706
But the truth is

296
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,806
She's thinking of someone other than Afzal.

297
00:19:50,806 --> 00:19:52,430
Who?

298
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,057
There's no one!

299
00:19:54,057 --> 00:19:57,952
But perhaps she's thinking Afzal's not the right choice either.

300
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,820
Which prayer is that?

301
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,011
The night prayer.

302
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,836
Did you offer those 12 additional prayers?

303
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:47,346
It's been a good while.

304
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,176
Alright, get ready.

305
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:50,127
They're coming.

306
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,158
And you may be called at any moment.

307
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:53,774
To the dickens with them!

308
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,074
Won't these two prayers and 12 additional ones do anything?

309
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:58,474
They would have, but think about it:

310
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:01,290
Whom are your prayers directed against?

311
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,900
One who offers all five of his and leads others'?

312
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,060
You'll get a bit of your reward and the 12 prayers will be of use later.

313
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,300
Didn't you tell Mum?

314
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,916
I did tell her,

315
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,727
And don't even ask how delira and excira she was about it!

316
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:16,431
What's the problem then?

317
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,241
Why should I get ready?

318
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,122
Dad's come, too.

319
00:21:20,122 --> 00:21:21,692
Don't worry about Dad.

320
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:23,555
Mum will explain to him real quick.

321
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:26,945
If Dad understood it, it'll be time for a right beating!

322
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,482
Whom will he beat?

323
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,073
Don't ask whom.

324
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:31,370
Ask whom he will <i>not</i> beat!

325
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,626
It's good for your health

326
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,757
That you get ready in half an hour however you can!

327
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:39,056
Mum's hand is doing all the talking.

328
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:40,276
What do you mean?

329
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:43,306
Now, I've taken a few slaps before.

330
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:44,755
It's no problem with me.

331
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,157
But you've been deprived of this benediction thus far.

332
00:21:47,157 --> 00:21:49,337
A single slap may prove to be fatal.

333
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:51,138
And, judging by her intentions,

334
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:52,703
It seems Mum will not stop at one,

335
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:56,013
She won't stop until you're battered!

336
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,149
Start in the Lord's name! They're here.

337
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,700
Peace be upon you!
-And upon you, peace, mercy, and blessings of God!

338
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,830
As God wills! [praise]

339
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,630
Peace be upon you!
-And upon you, peace, my child.

340
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,169
May you live long.

341
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:22,060
You have

342
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,657
Elevated me in stature, Monseigneur Ibrahim.

343
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:30,002
I used to think, like any mother, that my son is a prince.

344
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:31,769
You have made my dream a reality.

345
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:34,370
It is our good fortune,

346
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,809
That our daughter

347
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:37,467
Will be married to one from such a noble House.

348
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:40,198
We'll take a good look at ours when we go back,

349
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:41,998
And see

350
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:44,968
If it is indeed noble.

351
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,790
Please, come in.

352
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,190
Come.
-In the name of the Lord.

353
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,837
This is Farah's room, isn't it?

354
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,277
Yes.

355
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,976
Where is she?

356
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,036
She's getting ready.

357
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:08,946
Come with me.

358
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,757
You've come here with the proposal, right?

359
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:14,967
No.

360
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:17,971
We were passing by and thought we'd pay a visit.

361
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:18,822
No way!

362
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,140
I know everything.

363
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,266
I'm just asking if you're prepared for everything.

364
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:23,120
Of course.

365
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,080
We are prepared.

366
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,659
Dad doesn't leave anything half-done.

367
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:28,692
Why are you standing there?

368
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,720
Please, sit down.

369
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,977
But what about that girl

370
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:39,120
Who used to write letters to Afzal?

371
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,296
What do you mean?

372
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,837
You'd told me

373
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,926
That Afzal loves a girl

374
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:47,937
And the two of them have an exchange of letters going on.

375
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:48,827
Don't you remember?

376
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,748
When I'd asked

377
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:52,676
'Do people still write letters in this day'?

378
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:55,437
And you'd said --
-It isn't Farah, then...

379
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:56,979
Farah?

380
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:00,000
Farah would write a letter?

381
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,531
Are you off your nut?

382
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:03,017
She doesn't write, you muppet,

383
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:04,330
She types.

384
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,491
An SMS, at the most.

385
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:07,848
But don't worry

386
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:10,009
Everything will be alright.

387
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,542
What will be alright?

388
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,746
My parents have come to your place.

389
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,320
Is it April Fools' today

390
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,808
That you'd say to them, 'You took it seriously? We were just kidding'!

391
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,630
Do you know

392
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,330
Mum's wearing a yellow gown after ages.

393
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,724
Seeing it, she said,

394
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:32,030
'This colour won't suit me'!

395
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,087
Dad said it would.

396
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:35,767
And she wore it.

397
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,677
And, about Dad -

398
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:40,156
He never goes to the barber except on Fridays.

399
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:42,176
Today's Sunday,

400
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:44,647
But he went today.

401
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,496
Left with a smile on his face,

402
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:51,866
Came back elated.

403
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,767
What were you saying?

404
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:55,817
No --

405
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:57,892
It's nothing.

406
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,670
So Farah's not the one?

407
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,746
May I talk to Farah?

408
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,439
Sure.

409
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:18,047
They're calling you downstairs.

410
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,986
Tell them we're coming in a few minutes.

411
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,236
They want you to come right now.

412
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:27,410
We've got to go right now.

413
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,936
Come.

414
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,697
I'm going downstairs; you've still got time.

415
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:47,290
Wear something nice.

416
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,441
No need to hatch any plots!

417
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,263
The tables have turned such

418
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:58,278
That his pawn will take your king.

419
00:26:58,278 --> 00:26:59,794
So please,

420
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:01,970
Accept your defeat today.

421
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,896
And marry him?

422
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,750
No; just get engaged.

423
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,930
An engagement can be broken.

424
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,357
But don't risk breaking so many hearts today.

425
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,220
Without telling the good lady,

426
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,230
I've brought this gold ring.

427
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,650
If you'd allow me,

428
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,100
May I put it on her after dinner?

429
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,931
As it pleases you, Reverend.

430
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,810
Thank you.

431
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,511
Do me another favour, would you?

432
00:28:11,511 --> 00:28:13,290
Pray tell.

433
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:17,070
Pinch me a couple of times

434
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,974
Before she comes.

435
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,280
Irsa,

436
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,190
The Reverend has brought a ring for Farah.

437
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,539
He's asking if he can put it on her after dinner.

438
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,690
Of course,

439
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,060
His wish is our command.

440
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,212
Why wait until after dinner? Why not before it?

441
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,232
Your wish is my command.

442
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,860
Go, my dear.

443
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,750
Bring her here.

444
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,805
Right.

445
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,945
I thought we'd hidden the two of them from each other for nothing.

446
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:18,824
Once they're engaged, they'd get a reason to have dinner together.

447
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,258
You've come to call me?

448
00:29:26,258 --> 00:29:27,584
Yes.

449
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:30,491
Come.
-You're coming like this?

450
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:32,679
Should I sit in a palanquin?

451
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,509
For God's sake, Farah.

452
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,172
At least wear something suited to the occasion.

453
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:38,430
What I'm wearing right now

454
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:41,905
Is <i>far</i> better than their better dresses!

455
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,021
Come.

456
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:46,439
I've been waiting for this for four hours.

457
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,940
There aren't many legal limitations to love.

458
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,916
Peace be upon you.

459
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,590
This is our Farah?

460
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,077
Yes.

461
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,890
Praise the Lord!

462
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,189
God ward the evil eye off her!

463
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:13,800
Monseigneur, I'd asked you

464
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,470
To pinch me.

465
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,920
But you forgot to!

466
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,587
The Reverend is just...

467
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,572
Sit down, my dear.

468
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:28,317
How can she sit down just like that?

469
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,187
Won't you embrace me?

470
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,240
Look closely, Reverend.

471
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,410
My Afzal has become the best one [Afzal] today!

472
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,802
Don't tarry now, Ruqaiyya!

473
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:46,130
Before I wake up from my sleep,

474
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,299
Put this ring on my daughter.

475
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,907
Come.

476
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:57,780
Sit down.

477
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,320
We can't wait any longer.

478
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,072
Please, sit.

479
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,969
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah], Reverend!

480
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:20,548
You've picked quite the ring.

481
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,350
Ask her if she likes it.

482
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,836
Do you like it?

483
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,962
She's just being demure...

484
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,338
No.

485
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:44,650
I'm not being demure.

486
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,360
It is with regret that I have to say this,

487
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,779
But no such engagement is happening here

488
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,362
As what you're so euphoric about.

489
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,300
It's all because of him!

490
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,370
The truth is

491
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,480
I was about to be married off to one Mehtab.

492
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,066
And I didn't like Mehtab one bit.

493
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:21,726
I thought I'd talk to Dad about it,

494
00:32:21,726 --> 00:32:24,626
But couldn't steel myself.

495
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,974
Dad liked him so much then.

496
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:30,691
That's why I feigned love for someone else.

497
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:32,191
In my haste, I found him,

498
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,457
And struck a deal

499
00:32:33,457 --> 00:32:36,440
Of 800,000 with him.

500
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,839
The deal's no more now.

501
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,430
I'd even told him

502
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,830
Not to bring his parents here.

503
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,543
But I don't know why

504
00:32:54,543 --> 00:32:56,694
He brought you here

505
00:32:56,694 --> 00:33:00,032
Without telling me or asking me about it!

506
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,420
I know

507
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,420
A moment's daftness brought me here.

508
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,100
But I'd never thought I'd call you here and decline.

509
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,350
Tell me,

510
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,900
What could I do?

511
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,588
And I swear by God, I don't even know your Afzal well enough!

512
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,400
Forgive me,

513
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,350
But he's a first rate fraudster.

514
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,350
The move he's played

515
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,190
Even after everything was decided

516
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:36,660
Is one I'll never forgive him for!

517
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,870
Forget getting engaged to him,

518
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,712
I don't even want to see his face!

519
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,360
I have but

520
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,470
One complaint from you, my dear...

521
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,233
I didn't ask <i>you</i> to pinch me...

522
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:14,131
Come, Ruqaiyya.

523
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,780
Tell Madame that under these circumstances,

524
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,920
I won't be able to have dinner...

525
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,410
Let's go.
-Come.

526
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,103
Do not bother, my dear...

527
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:06,960
I would much rather prefer the darkness...

528
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,000
Do not

529
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,426
Look at each other tonight.

530
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:21,506
There are questions in everyone's eyes,

531
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:25,045
But answers in no one's.

532
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,730
You didn't even ask him

533
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,700
Where he was off to!

534
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,363
Where could the poor lad go?

535
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,170
He's got the answers to your questions;

536
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,780
He's just hiding from you.

537
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,720
He must be thinking he'd come back

538
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,320
When Mum and Dad are asleep.

539
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,733
As if we could we fall asleep tonight!

540
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:42,383
I've

541
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:45,445
Seen to it.

542
00:36:45,445 --> 00:36:49,601
First bought a ring for his bride,

543
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:52,898
And then, sleeping pills for myself.

544
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,010
You'd known it all along?

545
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,395
I'd known nothing!

546
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:05,360
But I'd known so much

547
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,674
That the thrill of gladness wouldn't let us sleep!

548
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:11,861
Here.

549
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,844
Take one

550
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:15,750
And give me one.

551
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,522
I would never take one!

552
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,375
I'll sit and writhe in pain all night.

553
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,737
Oh?

554
00:37:21,737 --> 00:37:23,298
Alright.

555
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:24,281
Then,

556
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:27,869
Wake me up at daybreak.

557
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:30,720
If you run away from woe, Reverend,

558
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,524
You'll find him at your doorstep in the morning!

559
00:37:32,524 --> 00:37:35,770
We shall see in the morning.

560
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,400
If he shows up uninvited,

561
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
He can't meet us when <i>he</i> pleases!

562
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,697
I'll meet him at <i>my</i> leisure. Right.

563
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,045
Your honour is a bit weak.

564
00:37:56,967 --> 00:37:58,801
No.

565
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:02,320
My heart is a bit weak.

566
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,851
At least tell me something

567
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:54,928
That makes me feel that you consider me a friend.

568
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:56,900
I won't tell you anything,

569
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,634
But I'll torch all her letters today.

570
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:00,855
She left you?

571
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:02,622
Here, mate.

572
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,375
Take a puff of this,

573
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,736
Forget all your sorrows and leave her.

574
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:10,063
No. Don't smoke.

575
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:13,410
He who smokes away his life for one so unfaithful is more animal than man!

576
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,944
Mum and Dad have been humiliated so much!

577
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:17,819
What do I do about that?

578
00:39:17,819 --> 00:39:20,317
Did they go along too?

579
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,610
Apologise to your parents --

580
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,647
Again?

581
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:29,819
I ask forgiveness of Dad every other day, and that's enough!

582
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:32,801
There's nothing wrong about it, mate.

583
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,480
It's your duty to ask forgiveness

584
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,365
And theirs to forgive.

585
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,360
To be truthful, parents

586
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,717
Do God's work in their old age.

587
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,609
That's what He does, too.

588
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,778
His creation errs,

589
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:50,353
And He forgives.

590
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,810
Mum thinks I'm 'Afzal' [the most excellent].

591
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,777
But I've realised today I'm the most depraved.

592
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,151
She'd not have slept!

593
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,996
She will, once you set foot in the house.

594
00:40:04,996 --> 00:40:07,166
Won't she be furious?

595
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,401
Won't she ask, 'Why did you take your father there'?

596
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:11,930
Why did you take him?

597
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,997
Didn't you know she'd decline?

598
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:18,327
What could I do, Sajid?

599
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:22,835
One has to be untrue if one's heart is untrue.

600
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:25,423
There wouldn't have been any mention of it had my parents not gone there,

601
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,905
And had there been no mention of it, how would I have known that all her letters were but lies?

602
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,790
Who declined the proposal?

603
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,837
Was it her or her parents?

604
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:37,321
She did.

605
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,250
So did she write all those letters to get her nib working?

606
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,311
Just say it openly that she's turned out to be unfaithful.

607
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,921
She can't be.

608
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,663
She used to write him letters twice every week.

609
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,461
How can she be unfaithful?

610
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:53,671
I get it.

611
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:55,973
Her parents must not have agreed to it.

612
00:40:55,973 --> 00:40:58,670
And convinced her, too, for the sake of her parents,

613
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,390
With a fair bit of begging and praying.

614
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,798
There's not a bit of perfidy in this.

615
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:09,537
When a girl listens to her parents, she just declines.

616
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,370
It's nothing new.

617
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:16,449
More than 50% love stories end when the parents beg before their children.

618
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:18,680
But I'm glad to hear this.

619
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,446
Let me say this straight, Afzal,

620
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:23,461
What could a girl respect you,

621
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,383
If she does not respect her parents' honour?

622
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:27,101
Shut up, mate!

623
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:30,415
If she had the slightest concern for her parents' honour,

624
00:41:30,415 --> 00:41:32,696
She could've just asked her Mum before falling in love,

625
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,116
'Should I'?

626
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,560
Why must it always strike people later on?

627
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,180
You should forget her too.

628
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,480
Burn the pyre of your love,

629
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,159
And scatter the ashes in the Ganges,

630
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,956
And look towards the Yamuna.

631
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:45,332
Who's Yamuna?

632
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:46,579
You bugger!

633
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:48,007
The Yamuna is next to the Ganges!

634
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,228
And there must be someone beyond the Yamuna.

635
00:41:50,228 --> 00:41:52,961
Can't anyone else in Hyderabad write letters?

636
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,492
You, too, should get out of these exchanges of letters,

637
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:57,321
And try texting!

638
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:59,691
The world's speeding up.

639
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,598
Speed up your love, too!

640
00:42:01,598 --> 00:42:04,070
Talk to someone else!

641
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,897
There.

642
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,390
The bugger's crying now!

643
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
