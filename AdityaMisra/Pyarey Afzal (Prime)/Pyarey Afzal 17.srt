1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,870
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,126
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,126 --> 00:00:24,223
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:30,687
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:36,170
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,890
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,246
My Afzal!

8
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:18,913
He's alright, isn't he?

9
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,818
Yes, he's --

10
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,043
He's alright.

11
00:01:23,043 --> 00:01:24,632
Sit down.

12
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,570
Sit...

13
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,940
If...

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,881
If you are tormented like this,

15
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:38,720
It'd make things difficult for me.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,228
This lordly wont of yours of whacking him,

17
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,246
Get this out of yourself!

18
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:49,652
Your son's a young man.

19
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,370
And he's --

20
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,064
Out of control, at that.

21
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:56,876
What if, one of these days,

22
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,627
He went astray?

23
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,095
So?

24
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,194
You've forgotten already!

25
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,460
He threatens us

26
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,195
With his departure

27
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:08,195
From here!

28
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:10,506
Should I yield to his threats?

29
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,413
It won't be this way, Reverend,

30
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:13,638
If he does something wrong,

31
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:14,854
I'll whack him.

32
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:17,601
Alright, then, don't budge!

33
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,365
But remember, also,

34
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,293
That it won't be like this every time.

35
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,699
One of these days, you'll wake up

36
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:30,047
To the news that he's boarded the 3.15 a.m. train and left!

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,938
This is why

38
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:43,204
I'm keeping good terms with the Doctor.

39
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,929
So that if I have to tell you something like this,

40
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:48,328
I would

41
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:50,642
Bring the Doctor along

42
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:52,452
And say to him,

43
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:57,108
'Keep every medicine for the heart ready'.

44
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:02,555
'I'm about to tell Ruqaiyya'.

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,967
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah], Reverend!

46
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,154
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

47
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:19,711
You just told me.

48
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,062
The blighter's left, eh?

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,628
If he boarded the 3.15 a.m. train, he'd have arrived there by now.

50
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,806
You're alright, aren't you?

51
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,348
You wept at your Mum's death,

52
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,439
That's when I last saw those tears.

53
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,488
And then, I'm seeing them today.

54
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,167
Fear God, Reverend.

55
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:18,369
Don't vilify my Afzal with your tears.

56
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,495
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

57
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:30,837
It's beating like a train.

58
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,572
Chuff-chuff!

59
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,245
You --

60
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:38,859
You're alright, aren't you?

61
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, what does it look like?

62
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,780
So what if I'm Afzal's mother?

63
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,388
I'm also Reverend Subhanallah's wife.

64
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,770
And breakfast too.

65
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,170
You've come from Lahore?

66
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,720
You stare as if you're from Lahore.

67
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,428
Hey, mate,

68
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,879
How much will it be?
-40.

69
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,981
How do the Lahoris stare?

70
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,003
Like I used to.

71
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:32,033
When I came here from Lahore, I used to stare at people like you do.

72
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,980
Where are you from?

73
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:39,513
Nowhere.

74
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,845
You looking for a place to rent?

75
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,012
Nobody came to get you, you had breakfast at the bistro and are now sitting at the bus stop.

76
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:25,994
Which means you've come here like a certain Lahori.

77
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,160
Won't you check what kind of a man I am?

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,180
Alright, tell me what kind you are.

79
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,622
Not the good kind...

80
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:37,588
Then come along, will you?

81
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,806
I'm not the good kind either.

82
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,284
However fast you stravaig about,

83
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:55,720
You can't get to Karachi.

84
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,251
He's gone.

85
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,377
He's switched off his phone.

86
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:02,971
Now, you can't apologise to him even if you want to.

87
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:05,878
Why would I apologise to him?

88
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:09,188
I've begun to augur like you.

89
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,443
Like you knew last night that he's going.

90
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:14,052
You'd even said,

91
00:08:14,052 --> 00:08:17,506
'He's out now', 'He's gotten there', 'He's left'!

92
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:22,131
Just like that, I have a feeling you're desperate to apologise to him.

93
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,946
Of course, I'm not!

94
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:27,696
I hear words like these as an augury.

95
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:31,156
But wait and watch what happens in the evening.
-What?

96
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,412
I'd find you on the terrace.

97
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,561
So?

98
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,944
So what? Let the evening come; you'll see...

99
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,207
Does he have another number?

100
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,378
I'm pitying

101
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,566
His Mum and Dad.

102
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,503
If he turned back and returned,

103
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:49,907
I wouldn't have any problem apologising.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,860
Just for...

105
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,227
Humanity's sake?

106
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,585
Ask your Dad not to lead the prayers for a few days.

107
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,770
Only the Lord can take care of a prayer

108
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,155
That constantly reminds one of the son...

109
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,928
I could bathe six times with so much water.

110
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:46,362
And in five minutes, not a drop will drip from the tap.

111
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:48,479
Oh? Why is that?

112
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,308
She cuts off the water supply at 8.

113
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:53,448
Who?

114
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,120
The landlady's daughter.

115
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,303
So

116
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:01,477
Why don't you talk to the landlady?

117
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,211
Don't you pay the rent?

118
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,610
I did.

119
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,379
Except the last four months.

120
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,589
How much is the rent?

121
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,735
6,000.

122
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:13,360
6,000 a month?

123
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,844
Aye.

124
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,560
How say I pay it?

125
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,122
A total of 24,000?

126
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,170
Yes.

127
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,711
Be my guest.

128
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:28,709
But steel yourself for you won't be getting it back.

129
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,052
I won't demand it.

130
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:32,632
Oh...

131
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,823
You're developing a relationship, eh?

132
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,370
Aye.

133
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,049
Tell me...

134
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,563
Tell me something about yourself.

135
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,156
What do you do?

136
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:55,300
What's your name?

137
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,510
Tell me his name!

138
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,810
What's your problem?

139
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,337
How many times do I tell you!?

140
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,639
Hey!

141
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,454
Tell me!

142
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,388
That's --

143
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,383
There's a girl screaming!

144
00:12:08,383 --> 00:12:12,260
You get to hear this on Saturday nights.

145
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:15,620
The shinach comes steamin' fou.

146
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,580
The shinach is her husband.

147
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,197
Then, he remembers his wife's old affair.

148
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:23,367
What's he full of?

149
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,574
You belong to this world, don't you?

150
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:28,510
Don't you know what it means to be fou?

151
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,901
Oh...

152
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,660
<i>That</i> stuff.

153
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,725
Not '<i>that</i> stuff',

154
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:33,680
The sup.

155
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,996
The pric pwdin drinks the bevvy.

156
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,760
Then, he asks her the bloke's name;

157
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,764
He knows it very well, but still asks her.

158
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:40,536
'Where did you meet', 'Where do you talk',

159
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:44,300
'Where do you meet', 'What are youse twos up to' - Every single detail.

160
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,985
And she tells him everything?

161
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,536
She's told him everything before her marriage.

162
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:50,022
Now, she just

163
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:52,085
Takes a right walloping, and says...

164
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,240
Stop it, will you?

165
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,949
You've donged me twice already!

166
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,183
Everyone will hear it

167
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,573
If I scream.

168
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,486
Be done with it already!

169
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:29,012
It doesn't look proper for a man to cry.

170
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:30,965
There!

171
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:32,074
Please stay quiet!

172
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,293
Let me do the talking.

173
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,377
Step aside.
-Wait, Jasmine!

174
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:45,626
Step aside!

175
00:13:45,626 --> 00:13:47,567
I'll clobber him today!

176
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,459
Leave it be.

177
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,940
He's crying in a corner now.

178
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,485
Who's...

179
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:03,702
Who's this girl?

180
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,955
She's the landlady's daughter.

181
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:09,845
She's the blighter who cuts off the water supply here.

182
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,562
Don't peek from the window;

183
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,289
If she saw you, she'd turn and barge in here. Come in.

184
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,537
Why would she come?

185
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:19,473
I'm not allowed to have guests stay over; come in.

186
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,187
Yes, Dad?

187
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,892
Sit.

188
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,158
Why are you so anxious?

189
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,734
No?

190
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,625
It's nothing like that.

191
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,688
You

192
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,469
Just called me so suddenly...

193
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:13,500
I figured it must be something important.

194
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,664
Now, I'm anxious...

195
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,431
What it may be...

196
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:20,943
Your going to London is nothing to get anxious about.

197
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,568
I'm going to London?

198
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,802
That's what I'm asking - when?

199
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:26,557
Never?

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,548
What are you saying?

201
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,806
I mean, what's the need to go to London?

202
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,854
I'm all alone.

203
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:34,111
What would I do there?

204
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,450
But your mother told me you'd rather not get married.

205
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,762
Not at all, Dad...

206
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:41,022
I didn't say I won't get married.

207
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:45,083
I said I'd rather not get married <i>just yet</i>. I would in a year or two...

208
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,972
What about your MPhil, then?

209
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,896
I'll go to Karachi for it.

210
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,442
We have a house there, too!

211
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:54,272
Lubna can come along too.

212
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:56,661
When did you think of this?

213
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:00,558
The same day I thought I'm not going to London at all.

214
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,778
You seem a bit disturbed.

215
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,853
Tell me if there's any problem.

216
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:10,890
You may take your time if the haste has gotten you perplexed.

217
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,513
Think carefully.

218
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:17,121
Discuss it with your Mum or Lubna.

219
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,450
Alright.

220
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,995
I'll discuss it with Lubna.
-Sit.

221
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,178
What is your problem?

222
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,629
There's no problem.

223
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,178
Everything's alright, Dad.

224
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:33,327
What's alright?

225
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:38,089
I'm your father, not a chickpea chapman!

226
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,697
I'm talking to you about your career!

227
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,979
So what have I done?

228
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:48,039
You're saying you'd discuss it with Lubna after telling me everything?

229
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,725
But it was you who'd said,

230
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:51,913
'Discuss it with Lubna'...

231
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,790
Alright, call Lubna here.

232
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,381
She's standing outside.

233
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,955
Come in, Lubna.

234
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:00,330
Lubna, come in.

235
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,228
I've told Dad that you're --

236
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:04,677
Just outside...

237
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,472
Yes, Dad?

238
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,378
What were you doing, standing outside?

239
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,017
Nothing, Dad.

240
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,643
I'd come with her.

241
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:19,425
Then, I realised that it was just supposed to be between the two of you.

242
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:21,769
So, I thought I'd stand outside.

243
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,782
Come and sit.

244
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,696
What is going on in her mind these days?

245
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:35,542
Karachi.

246
00:17:35,542 --> 00:17:37,198
It's --

247
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:38,856
Right...

248
00:17:38,856 --> 00:17:42,824
So the two of you have talked about the Karachi plan already.

249
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,392
Yes...

250
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,387
And what would you do there?

251
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:48,465
Me?

252
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:50,796
What would I do, Dad?

253
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:54,561
You've still got three semesters left.

254
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,501
Semesters?

255
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:01,561
If you've talked about it, haven't you thought about your admission?

256
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:05,027
What if you waste your first semester?

257
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,892
Alright, you don't have to worry about anything. Don't worry about your admission.

258
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:18,861
But has either of you thought about what'd happen to us over here?

259
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,607
The two of you would be left alone...

260
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:24,033
Thank goodness, Mademoiselle remembers as much.

261
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,232
How could I not remember?

262
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:27,934
How would you stay alone?

263
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,965
I'm not leaving you.

264
00:18:32,836 --> 00:18:34,901
Get her out, Lubna.

265
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:39,381
She'll shred my brain into a spaghetti.

266
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,510
Discuss it thoroughly with her today,

267
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,052
And tell me what it is that she wants tomorrow.

268
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,894
Come.

269
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,496
Good night, Dad...

270
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,787
Why have you come to Karachi?

271
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,037
Looking for a job?

272
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,569
To become a great man.

273
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:23,616
So are you a twopenny-halfpenny man?

274
00:19:24,117 --> 00:19:29,884
Nowhere will you find a great man if he's not inside you.

275
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,348
Why did <i>you</i> come to Karachi?

276
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:42,503
Don't ask me anything, boyo...

277
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:45,977
Then don't ask <i>me</i> anything either.

278
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,585
I'll see whose oul' fella's got the guts to stop me once I become a great man!

279
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,676
Give me the gasper.

280
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,349
25 runs were needed to win in the last over of a match.

281
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:17,219
Everyone thought it's impossible.

282
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,496
Because when you need 25 runs to win in the last over, you just can't make it.

283
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,080
But I made it.

284
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,875
Didn't he figure out why you're talking about going to Karachi?

285
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,624
Figure out?

286
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:45,097
I've told him clearly that I'll be pursuing my MPhil there.

287
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:49,407
He was chuffed to hear that I dropped the option of London.

288
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:52,329
For Afzal?

289
00:20:52,578 --> 00:20:54,080
What?

290
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,251
How does that even make sense?

291
00:20:56,251 --> 00:20:58,034
Am I pursuing my MPhil for him?

292
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,132
Are you touched in the head?

293
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:01,644
Then why Karachi?

294
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:04,734
Why not Lahore or Islamabad?

295
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,825
Do I look like a moran?

296
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:13,432
I know you inside out, Farah Ibrahim.

297
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:17,243
That is why Dad's asked me to find out what you're up to.

298
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,416
So you think I'm going after Afzal?

299
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,493
You loony lass,

300
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,318
If I had to go after him,

301
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:27,206
Why did I let him out of here in the first place?

302
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,299
But, because of him, I've thought

303
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,957
That one should not leave one's parents like this.

304
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,012
I keep on thinking about Aunt Ruqaiyya

305
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,240
And the Reverend.

306
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,880
They've only got one son,

307
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,434
One so magnificent [= Afzal] at that!

308
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,797
I don't believe that.

309
00:21:50,924 --> 00:21:52,500
Believe what?

310
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,171
Your intentions and actions

311
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,906
Are polar opposites.

312
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:59,902
You remember him more than his Mum and Dad!

313
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,360
You'll get whacked by me now.

314
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,636
I'd take it.

315
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:06,777
But I won't go with you on this SAR mission with you!

316
00:22:06,777 --> 00:22:08,635
I'm not insisting that you do.

317
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,340
Don't come if you don't want to.

318
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,447
I'd just mentioned your name to ease Dad.

319
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,947
How does it ease Dad?

320
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,497
If you're with me, I'd thought,

321
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,856
Mum and Dad would think I'm not alone there.

322
00:22:19,856 --> 00:22:22,540
Someone's there to look after me.

323
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,782
A fib.

324
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:25,313
I can swear on it.

325
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:27,407
So you're not going after him?

326
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,892
Ask forgiveness of God!

327
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,969
And you don't love him either?

328
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:34,325
God forgive!

329
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,342
Place your hand on my head.

330
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,181
Swear on me.

331
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:42,306
I swear by you.

332
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:44,430
But if I chance upon him somewhere,

333
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,575
I'd grab his collar.

334
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,701
Why?

335
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,627
I'll say, 'Come to Hyderabad, you blighter'!

336
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:52,062
'Your Mum and Dad are looking for you'.

337
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:53,697
Who are you to say that?

338
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:55,243
I mean, if he asked,

339
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:56,419
'Who are you to ask this'?

340
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,044
'Who are you to me'?

341
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,216
'And who do you mean by Mum and Dad'?

342
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:03,860
'The same you'd invited over and humiliated'?

343
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,012
'And before whom'

344
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,664
'You'd humiliated me at my home'?

345
00:23:06,664 --> 00:23:09,433
What would you say to that?

346
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:10,838
Would he say all of that?

347
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:13,707
As if he'd laud you for grabbing his collar!

348
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:14,827
Remember,

349
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,552
It's his turn now.

350
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:20,675
You got him out of Hyderabad, and this fact won't ever get out of his heart.

351
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:24,080
He'll get even with you one day.

352
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,541
Get even?

353
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,048
'Like a king would treat another'.

354
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:32,002
How would a king treat another?

355
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,650
I'll tell you tomorrow.

356
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,494
I don't know it well enough.

357
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:39,624
But I have a feeling it's very cruel.

358
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,270
Step aside.

359
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:51,524
Where's that blighter Babu Hamid?

360
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:53,141
Babu Hamid!

361
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:54,915
Babu Hamid!

362
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:56,896
Babu Hamid!

363
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,259
Now where did he go?

364
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:05,005
And who would you be?

365
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,420
Good Lord, it's you!

366
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,909
What are you doing here?

367
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,684
Have we met before?

368
00:25:12,684 --> 00:25:14,344
Met, as in?

369
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,109
Do we have those meetings?

370
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,188
Not at all --

371
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:19,440
You just said, 'It's you'.

372
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,039
Pray tell, who?

373
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,096
I saw you on the train.

374
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:26,855
You were coming to Karachi from Lahore.

375
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:30,209
No, I was on the train from Lahore to Karachi.

376
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,257
You don't have the manners to sit at your place,

377
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:36,567
Spreading your legs as if they're someone else's!

378
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,718
Go.

379
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,510
'Go'?

380
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,209
Would you leave yourself or do I need to grab your hand and drag you out?

381
00:25:50,209 --> 00:25:51,396
What?

382
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:53,117
What did you just say?

383
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,039
You'd drag me out

384
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,180
Out of here?

385
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,522
Out of this house?

386
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,568
And you'd grab my hand, too!

387
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:00,983
That's tidy; tell me,

388
00:26:00,983 --> 00:26:02,530
Where are you from?

389
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:07,234
In which city of the world is it a trend that it's no problem if you grab Jasmine's hand like that?

390
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,049
I've come from Hyderabad.

391
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:11,430
And if you said again that I'm tailing you,

392
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,936
I'd thro --
-Throw?

393
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:15,499
Mam!

394
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:17,290
Mam!

395
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:18,642
Mam!

396
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:20,201
Your Mum's the same one, is she?

397
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:22,295
From the train?

398
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:25,679
You're going to --

399
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,850
Just end this quarrel and leave.

400
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,813
There's no Babu Hamid around here.
-How come?

401
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,206
I'm Babu Hamid.

402
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:35,380
I'd just gone to get some breakfast.

403
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,350
You've kept her standing all this time?

404
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,599
As if he'd have me sit, Syr Babu!

405
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,301
He was about to throw me out.

406
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:43,380
Who's this blighter?

407
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,024
Such a brash girl!

408
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:49,170
Shut up, boyo, she's my landlady.

409
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:49,984
And...

410
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,185
He's -- no blighter either,

411
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:54,779
He's a rather topping [Afzal] type.

412
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,926
You've come to collect the rent, haven't you?

413
00:26:56,926 --> 00:27:00,270
You're saying as if you've got the money in your pocket!

414
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,983
Exactly.

415
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:02,763
I've got it in my pocket since the morning.

416
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:04,146
Hold this, will you?

417
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,690
Right here.

418
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,140
That's a total of 24,000 there.

419
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,278
But what's <i>he</i> doing here?

420
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:22,825
If he's come to meet, that's alright,

421
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:25,699
If he's here to stay, show him out right now. C'mon!

422
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:26,391
Get out!

423
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:27,971
No -- He can't leave.

424
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:33,600
How wouldn't he? Even his Tad would --
-If you mentioned my Dad, I'd break your face!

425
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,699
Good Lord!

426
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:36,944
He's a ruffian!

427
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:39,428
No, he's --
-Mam!

428
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:40,396
Mam!

429
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:41,520
A ruffian!

430
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,160
Why does she call out to her Mum every time?

431
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,746
She's got no one except her Mum.
-Mum, a ruffian!

432
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:48,682
Mum, a ruffian's broken in! Come here quickly!
-Why doesn't she come here, then?

433
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:50,767
She's wise.

434
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,857
What's that bosh?

435
00:27:52,857 --> 00:27:55,391
It's just that you don't know the true story...

436
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:58,480
These 24,000 you have clenched in your hands,

437
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,796
He's paid it.

438
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:03,123
If you kick him out, your money's obviously out the door too.

439
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,399
So, either you can

440
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,647
Return the money,

441
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:09,257
Or just talk to your Mam for once.

442
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,786
Alright.

443
00:28:17,786 --> 00:28:19,477
I'll be back after talking to Mam.

444
00:28:19,477 --> 00:28:20,964
That's tidy.

445
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,180
She won't be coming back.

446
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,879
Why?

447
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,017
She's a blighter,

448
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,960
She won't ask; she'll be advising,

449
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,475
'To the devil with all sorrows if we're getting the rent on time'.

450
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:35,634
Alright, let's just have breakfast, shall we?

451
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,428
Come. Here.

452
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,958
Where are the plates -- Oh, right.

453
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,168
Don't let her go to Karachi.

454
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:52,618
I won't let her go anywhere until she's been married.

455
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,770
Then talk it out with her straight.

456
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,630
Everything's been talked about.

457
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,396
You don't talk, Madame, you chaffer.

458
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:04,805
'Talk' as in, explain it to her.

459
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,912
And 'explain' as in, she's got to agree.

460
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,350
She's not being reasonable when deciding.

461
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,566
She acts first and thinks later.

462
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,331
It was just yesterday

463
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:18,590
She was ready to wager everything to be able to go to London.

464
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,246
And today, she's suddenly figured that she should be going to Karachi?

465
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,170
Do you know why she wants to go to Karachi?

466
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,830
Because Afzal's left home and gone to Karachi.

467
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,087
Are you in your senses?

468
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,790
We've talked to her about Afzal already.

469
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,400
Has she forgotten

470
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,197
The day she'd insulted Afzal?

471
00:29:37,197 --> 00:29:40,339
Once, before us, and then again, at his home!

472
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,936
You've forgotten too,

473
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,999
You'd said just a while ago,

474
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,161
'She acts first and thinks later'.

475
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:50,785
So, she's thinking right now that she had not been fair on Afzal.

476
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,925
Good morning.

477
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:55,278
Good morning.

478
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,390
Good morning.
-Good morning.

479
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,260
So you've decided to go to Karachi?

480
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,748
Yes?

481
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:08,370
I'd told you already.

482
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,796
Think over it again.

483
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:14,432
Why should I need to think over it again?

484
00:30:14,432 --> 00:30:16,239
I've decided after a lot of thinking.

485
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,475
That's what <i>you</i> think.

486
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:22,459
Everyone else thinks that you'd ponder over it after you've left.

487
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,662
Why are you making an issue of it?

488
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:27,289
You should be delighted.

489
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:29,709
Because I'm not delighted.

490
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:38,598
That's why I've decided that you're not going to Karachi.

491
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,309
What the devil is going on?

492
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,742
Care to tell me?

493
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,414
How could I tell you?

494
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,444
I haven't the foggiest about what it is Dad wants to talk about.

495
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:17,521
Put a sock in it!

496
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:18,386
Dad said

497
00:31:18,386 --> 00:31:20,090
That I'd think after I've left,

498
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,989
And that everybody thinks this way.

499
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:24,540
Everybody, as in,

500
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,813
Including <i>you</i>.

501
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,988
But I'd only told Mum about this,

502
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,771
And said that it's strictly confidential.

503
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:33,978
What?

504
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:36,199
She was working on your character sketch.

505
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,760
She was trying to fathom her Farah's noble qualities.

506
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,840
I thought

507
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,775
She didn't know about this one.

508
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,970
But don't worry.

509
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,811
Dad will think about who it is he's messing with.

510
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:55,895
Say your prayers.

511
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:57,565
Why?

512
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:59,799
Do you doubt my belief in the Lord?

513
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,612
I doubt <i>my belief</i> that you're alive!

514
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:02,648
Say your prayers,

515
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:06,054
Or you'd be herded along with the sinners!

516
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:09,750
What are you looking for?

517
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,919
I'm looking for a knife!

518
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,253
You'd kill me?

519
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:16,947
Let me just find a knife, I'll tell you!

520
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:17,632
Hey!

521
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:19,660
Don't talk about bloodshed.

522
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,764
Just go and say it plainly that you've fallen for Afzal,

523
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:25,454
And you're going after him.

524
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,798
Bring your head over here.

525
00:32:35,798 --> 00:32:37,200
What'd you do with my head?

526
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,065
Place my hand on it and swear that I don't love Afzal!

527
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:41,416
Just think as if

528
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,814
I've not exactly despised him.

529
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:44,697
There, now.

530
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:46,384
Don't surprise me.

531
00:32:46,384 --> 00:32:47,979
Why would you be surprised?

532
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:50,327
I have some experience too, Farah.

533
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,374
So what, if I've never fallen in love?

534
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:54,941
I have borne witness to love blossoming.

535
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:56,506
You haven't the 'e' of experience,

536
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:59,392
Not with your world going round thanks to devilry and bijoux!

537
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:01,254
Just let me get to Karachi,

538
00:33:01,254 --> 00:33:06,012
I'll scupper all your experience and send it to Davy Jones' Locker!

539
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,170
There are only two ways out for me:

540
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,715
Drown in the ocean,

541
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:18,718
Or surface and get across.

542
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:21,637
Honestly,

543
00:33:21,637 --> 00:33:24,779
Have you come here after you lost in love?

544
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:28,562
I've triumphed in love and come.

545
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:31,778
And one who loves like me can never lose.

546
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:34,856
Why, then, do you talk like you've lost?

547
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:36,498
Why did you say

548
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:38,988
That there's just two ways out for you?

549
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:41,749
There's but one road to love

550
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,373
That starts from the heart

551
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:46,810
And ends at the beloved's doorstep.

552
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,167
Is there someone in your way?

553
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,025
Yes.

554
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:53,494
Who?

555
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:57,682
A twopenny-halfpenny man who looks like me.

556
00:33:57,682 --> 00:34:01,630
I'd been hiding behind him,

557
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,197
Which is why she could never seen me.

558
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:07,722
How many runs did you score in the final over of the match?

559
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:09,098
25.

560
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:10,906
Amazing.

561
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,555
Then, it'd do you good to hear and remember that love is a match that's all about the final over, Syr Afzal.

562
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,720
You'll only score as many runs as she'd want you to,

563
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,844
And if she does not,

564
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:23,516
On all six balls,

565
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,408
You may get beaten all ends up.

566
00:34:26,408 --> 00:34:28,886
I know how to play cricket.

567
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:31,822
And I've learnt to love.

568
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:36,635
Remember that if I ever needed to score 25 runs there,

569
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,058
I'd do it.

570
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,939
Otherwise, only my corse would be returning to Hyderabad.

571
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,216
Should it have to come to that,

572
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:01,903
Please send my corse with your own hands.

573
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:05,702
And never say that I'm going back defeated.

574
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:09,240
Even if I'm beaten all ends up,

575
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,296
You'll see that I've won.

576
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,626
And said,

577
00:35:22,626 --> 00:35:25,277
'I'd throw' --
-Throw?

578
00:35:25,277 --> 00:35:28,638
And it's now that you're telling me!

579
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:31,527
He never said anything beyond that.

580
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:36,115
Wouldn't I have broken his jaw had he said anything?
-He did 'throw' you. Isn't that enough?

581
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,007
You and your words, Mam!

582
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,130
He didn't actually throw me,

583
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,394
Just said it as they do!

584
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:44,558
Who says such words to a girl?

585
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:47,149
I'll talk to him in the morning.

586
00:35:47,149 --> 00:35:49,384
One should never tell you anything, Mam!

587
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:51,166
I told you, he just uttered it casually.

588
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:55,329
If you show him this fury or kick him out, we'll have to give him 24,000 back.

589
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,235
Why would we have to return it?

590
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,424
Because <i>he</i>'s paid it.

591
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,199
And Babu Hamid?

592
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,310
He'll collect his 500 or 1,000 and leave.

593
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,660
I'll whack him on his face with a boot.

594
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,388
He'll take that boot but won't leave without his 500.

595
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:12,635
What are his dues, besides the rent?

596
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,260
14,800.

597
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,102
No --

598
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:17,963
He'd given 600; now, he's got 14,200 due.

599
00:36:17,963 --> 00:36:20,010
Alright, note it down, will you?

600
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,073
It'll be 14,700 tomorrow.

601
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,829
What happened?

602
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,605
Isn't it good?

603
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,830
It'll take a while.

604
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,260
It takes time to start liking and digest Karachi's food.

605
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,921
Would you prefer home-cooked food?

606
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:16,362
How'd I get that?

607
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:17,451
You can.

608
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:19,034
Our landlady, you know,

609
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,094
She'd cook you some.

610
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,291
She'd charge for it each month, though.

611
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,581
Oh, <i>her</i>!

612
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:26,785
She'd serve it peppery!
-No, it's her Mam who cooks.

613
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:30,660
Back when I had some money, she was the one who'd provide me.

614
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,557
So when there's no money in it,

615
00:37:32,557 --> 00:37:33,577
There's no food?

616
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,651
No, boyo.

617
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:36,150
She does blabber a bit.

618
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,989
But she used to cook me food.

619
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,274
I had some shame,

620
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:43,175
So I said I'd eaten something already whenever she asked.

621
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:45,285
You used to lie?

622
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,240
Yes,

623
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,454
Sometimes...

624
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,439
So what was the last thing you said?

625
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,879
He's been saying the same thing for 15 minutes.

626
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,950
That you cook the food and collect your money each month.

627
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,580
So,

628
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,925
How much would you take?

629
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,452
Ask him to shut his gob.

630
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:19,654
He has a bad reputation in Mam's eyes.

631
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:20,880
Go on.

632
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,812
What were you saying?

633
00:38:22,812 --> 00:38:25,980
We'd serve you food and you'd pay us for it each month?

634
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,930
Exactly.

635
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,159
Just like old times?

636
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,570
Enjoyed your food for three months and gobbled up the payment for a month!

637
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,915
Talk to <i>me</i>.

638
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:36,158
I'll enjoy the food for two months and pay you for three.

639
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:39,466
Ask him what he thinks I am.

640
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:41,653
Hold it right there you lippy laddie!

641
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:45,410
I hand over 50 or a 100 to the likes of you every now and then!

642
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,332
Anyway,

643
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:47,430
Go on.

644
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,527
Go on with what?

645
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,810
How much would you pay?

646
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,910
The payment would be the same old one.

647
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,283
8,000 a month?

648
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:55,143
Remember how much potatoes cost back then?

649
00:38:55,143 --> 00:38:57,039
And you'd get lentils for a 100 Rupees a kilogramme.

650
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,180
It's 120 now.

651
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,930
How much do spices cost?

652
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,962
Spices, let's see...

653
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,500
Why are you asking about spices?

654
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:11,080
No, it's just -- You were mentioning the rates, so I thought you could just as well tell me about spices too.

655
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,955
Look,

656
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:13,047
Let me get this straight,

657
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:15,240
I'll charge 10,000 per head for the food.

658
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,289
Let me know if it's okay; otherwise, I'm off.

659
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,000
It's okay.

660
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
