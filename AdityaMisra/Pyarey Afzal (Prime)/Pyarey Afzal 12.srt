1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,891
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:19,157
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:24,247
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:30,671
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:36,140
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,950
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,819
G -- Get this off me, doctor! I --

8
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:03,229
I'm going to see Mum!

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,650
Only after you've been unfettered!

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,902
For now, lie down!

11
00:01:07,847 --> 00:01:08,568
There.

12
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,154
Dad's here.

13
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,707
M -- My heart is sinking.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,970
Why is his heart sinking, Doctor?
-It's about the police! Happens with me, too!

15
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,531
Peace be upon you, sir.

16
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,664
And upon you, peace.

17
00:01:22,664 --> 00:01:23,573
Is he alive?

18
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,579
He is.

19
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,433
Alright, go home,

20
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,836
I'll take care of him.

21
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,579
Alright.

22
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:30,511
Give this scarf to the driver and send him to us once his wound's been dressed.

23
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,111
Whose is it?

24
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:33,656
Farah's.

25
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,828
Here.

26
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,340
Could he talk?

27
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,591
Easily.

28
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,520
He asked, 'Where am I'?

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,895
Why did he ask that?

30
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:57,840
Because when he came to,

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,540
He wasn't where he was <i>supposed to be</i>...

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,415
He's out of harm's way, isn't he?

33
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,265
He is in harm's way.

34
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:05,520
If he slit his wrist properly the next time,

35
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,727
He won't be able to talk.

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,050
You'll just be left remembering him talking.

37
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,998
Your love has killed my son!

38
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,040
Not at all?

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,007
He's alive -- alright.

40
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,294
Have mercy on him!

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,447
Don't show ingratitude to God

42
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,008
By kicking away the lover at your doorstep!

43
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,415
Aunt -- The thing is --

44
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,275
I've made a vow...

45
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:29,231
If he got to Karachi safe and sound,

46
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,949
I'd offer 10 additional prayers.

47
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,076
Have some glucose.

48
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,322
It'll comfort your heart.

49
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:42,876
<i>His</i> heart won't get any comfort

50
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:45,976
As long as he doesn't get you.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,260
He's here.

52
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,496
That's all it was!

53
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,635
Isn't he here?

54
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:11,199
Dad will bring him along.

55
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:13,561
He's alright, isn't he?

56
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:15,250
He's alright,

57
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,721
But his heart sunk at the sight of Dad!

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,009
Hey!

59
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:24,060
Doesn't it feel exhilarating

60
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,342
When one slits his wrist for someone?

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,686
Then change your mind.

62
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:31,260
To the Devil with your MPhil;

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,990
Think you've hit the jackpot

64
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,120
Getting a lover ready to lay down his life!

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,100
You're right,

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,809
But the nyaff didn't even slit his wrist properly!

67
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,843
Wouldn't he have died had he slit it properly?

68
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:44,157
One should have confidence in one's love, girl,

69
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,376
They say its mere touch vivifies.

70
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,939
And what about all those who died -

71
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,580
Heer, Laila, Majnun, Ranjha [Romeo & Juliet] -

72
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,009
Why weren't they vivified?

73
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,530
Lack of knowledge, sweetheart.

74
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,827
They didn't know

75
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:57,780
That if they tried a loving touch instead of struggling and dying in vain, they'd have been vivified!

76
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,090
Divined the 'news' somehow

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,910
And lay down their lives just like that!

78
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,750
Honestly,

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,189
Which film are you talking about?

80
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,080
I swear

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,454
I'm not talking about any film.

82
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,214
But my heart says

83
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,870
That love does have such power.

84
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,740
And I'm inclined to believe

85
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,372
What my heart says...

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,381
Did you hear, Madame,

87
00:04:24,381 --> 00:04:26,329
What she just said?

88
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,148
She'll only find peace when he slits his wrist properly!

89
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:32,465
Don't worry, Madame,

90
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,716
She must be kidding.

91
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,353
Does she intend to kill the poor lad with such kidding?

92
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,953
There, now...

93
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,268
Hello, Afzal?

94
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:07,720
Hello?

95
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:11,084
I've left after waiting for two hours.

96
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,695
Your father left the office before my eyes

97
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:15,047
And never came back.

98
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,890
Ah, yes, I almost forgot!

99
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,070
We'd run into a right trouble at home.

100
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,300
Mehtab, you know,

101
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,720
Had slit his wrist.

102
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,710
Thankfully, we got to know on time.

103
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,975
He'd almost died.

104
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:28,784
For Farah?

105
00:05:28,784 --> 00:05:30,490
No, for me!

106
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,823
He is bent upon laying down his life for Farah!

107
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,870
Such is his love?

108
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,630
Well,

109
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,421
He's proven it today.

110
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,131
I'll talk to you later.

111
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:43,858
Hey, listen!

112
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,163
We'll talk in a while.

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,020
Sit, Madame.

114
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,510
Sit.

115
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,819
Please listen carefully.

116
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,110
This is the last of his theatrics

117
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,636
That I've tolerated.

118
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:30,605
The entire neighbourhood would know if someone from my family had to see the doctor because he'd slit his wrist!

119
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,870
Let this be the closing bit of news after this one -

120
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,635
Mehtab's marriage to Farah is not possible.

121
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:42,008
What would he protect my daughter

122
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,442
Who couldn't protect his own life?

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,683
Yes, sir?

124
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:22,391
Apologies, my good man; something came up and I had to leave my office.

125
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:26,180
My PA mentioned that you'd come and left.

126
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,713
Yes, sir.

127
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,990
Please, come now.

128
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,572
I'll be reaching my office in about 15 minutes.

129
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:31,509
No, sir...

130
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,852
I'd be unable to come.

131
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,883
What do you mean?

132
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,100
I won't be coming, sir.

133
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,813
Here.

134
00:07:50,813 --> 00:07:53,191
I'm giving him a cheque 400,000 instead of 200,000.

135
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,263
Shove it in his face.

136
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,860
Threaten him if you have to

137
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,210
That if he left his job without notice,

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,199
He'd have to pay a penalty amounting to three months' pay!

139
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:08,470
The blighter wouldn't even have dreamt of 400,000 Rupees!

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,862
Should I go to his place?

141
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:11,898
Obviously.

142
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,357
He's not answering his phone.

143
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:17,751
And should I also say that he should meet Dad?

144
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,532
He'd better.

145
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:23,149
And would Dad meet him after his refusal?

146
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:25,950
Or will you give him a cheque or 400,000 too

147
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,522
And say, 'You'd better meet him, Dad'.

148
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,520
Where does he live?

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,355
Just about four alleys from here.

150
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,650
Get the car.

151
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,020
Please, sit down.

152
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,990
You'd call upon him?

153
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,480
Got a problem?

154
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,400
His house isn't like ours

155
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,850
That you can pull him into a corner and talk about it!

156
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,879
You'd come across Arifa the moment you get there,

157
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,544
Then, his Mum,

158
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:58,020
And the Reverend is at home after the night prayer.

159
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,454
If you'd meet a man from his family before his eyes,

160
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:03,248
What would he think?

161
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:06,680
It'd be taken as your desperation.

162
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,577
I don't care.

163
00:09:08,577 --> 00:09:10,771
You're the richest girl in the neighbourhood

164
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,930
But your dominion does not span it.

165
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,080
If the Reverend pronounced a judgement, you'd be utterly disgraced in a moment!

166
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,834
Judgement?

167
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,590
A Reverend's place is one of dignity,

168
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,640
And Mademoiselle would do well to honour it.

169
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,669
What kind of judgement?

170
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,143
A faithful girl strikes a deal

171
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:28,612
With a Reverend's son about 'love',

172
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:31,813
With the condition that he should two-time her.

173
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,180
You tell me if a harsh judgement ought to be ordained or not!

174
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,050
You're digging your own grave there.

175
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,690
And remember,

176
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,130
Just as the spade strikes the ground, Dad will have you sit in a palanquin for Mehtab.

177
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,231
Besides, you've earned a bad name in the entire neighbourhood because of Mehtab.

178
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,420
Sorry,

179
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,582
But a 'bad name' is the only way to say it in polite company.

180
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,745
Give me his number.

181
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,933
Sure.

182
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,505
Hello?

183
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:09,943
Hello.

184
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,599
This is my number

185
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,733
And it's me speaking.

186
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:15,754
Remember,

187
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:17,140
If you stayed quiet today,

188
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,589
I could become your worst nightmare!

189
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:21,368
Reply to everything properly.

190
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,094
You're under your Dad's oath now,

191
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:27,993
Tell me that you're listening.

192
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:29,659
I'm listening.

193
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,920
Splendid.

194
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,782
Now I know how to get you talking.

195
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:34,869
Tell me, now,

196
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,789
Why did you refuse to meet Dad?

197
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:39,018
What would it do if I met him?

198
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,191
What's that noise?

199
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:41,695
It's --

200
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,788
It's the lads from the neighbourhood playing cricket.

201
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:44,756
Brilliant!

202
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,475
And you're there, betting on it!

203
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,426
I'm not into betting anymore.

204
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,566
I've signed a cheque of 400,000 for you.

205
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:56,094
Take it from Lubna whenever you want.

206
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,509
But I won't meet your father.

207
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,799
Why not?

208
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,420
Am I blowing these 400,000 for nothing?

209
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,717
I won't collect those 400,000 either.

210
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:06,799
What's the matter with you?

211
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,405
Changing your colours like a chameleon!

212
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:12,474
I felt I was doing something worse than gambling,

213
00:12:12,474 --> 00:12:14,455
So, I thought I would rather not.

214
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,247
To the --

215
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,730
Care to tell me

216
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,230
How saving a girl's life

217
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,791
Is something wrong?

218
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:24,387
When someone else loses his life as one tries to save a girl's life,

219
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:25,850
That makes it very wrong.

220
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,028
Oh!

221
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:30,584
So you've come to know about the incident with the blighter Mehtab!

222
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,764
Don't push love away,

223
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,193
And don't call one who loves you a 'blighter'.

224
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,687
Honestly,

225
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:40,176
Has your girlfriend come to know?

226
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,365
Has she asked you

227
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:44,047
Not to love Farah?

228
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:46,754
Tell that twit

229
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:48,543
It's not for real!

230
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:52,820
For the first time, someone's getting paid to 'love'!

231
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,493
Oh, <i>she</i> hasn't the foggiest.

232
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:57,517
She doesn't know anything.

233
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:58,427
Look,

234
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,905
I'm in a proper mess.

235
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,856
And you're intent on betraying me.

236
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,507
This sword called Mehtab is ready to strike my head off!

237
00:13:04,507 --> 00:13:07,083
Dad's perplexed, too, because of your refusal.

238
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,851
God forbid if he voted in favour of Mehtab...

239
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,020
I'd --

240
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,880
I'd curse you!

241
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,750
And remember,

242
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,463
My curses always work!

243
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,847
If I vow to offer 100 additional prayers, my wish is granted after just 12 of them!

244
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,118
Fear me,

245
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,438
Or I'd say,

246
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:24,202
'May you never get the one who writes you letters'!

247
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:25,747
Wait!

248
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:28,923
Please don't curse me like this!

249
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,670
Scared the bejesus out of him!

250
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,381
Alright, then,

251
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,262
You're coming to office tomorrow, aren't you?

252
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,306
I will.

253
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:42,430
Call Dad the moment I disconnect,

254
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,921
Say sorry and tell him you're coming tomorrow.

255
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,523
So much noise!

256
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,495
Cookie's been caught out.

257
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,711
Who's Cookie?

258
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,850
One of the lads.

259
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,267
Anyway.

260
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,035
You'd call him, right?

261
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,291
I will in a moment.

262
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,190
Okay, bye!

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,697
I will tell you when I can understand it myself.

264
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:29,225
It felt as if he'd shoved me from behind and I'd fallen face first!

265
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:31,197
Said plainly, 'I'm not coming',

266
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:33,136
And disconnected.

267
00:14:33,136 --> 00:14:37,698
Figure out what it could mean and tell me!

268
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,142
Pay him a visit.

269
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:47,843
But I can swear we'd find no better suitor for Farah than him!

270
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,724
There's no need to go there now.

271
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,112
He'll come to meet you tomorrow,

272
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,566
And apologise to you too.

273
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,314
Why did he refuse, then?

274
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:05,530
Because of Mehtab.

275
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,113
He thought

276
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,684
It's not good to have someone like him in the house

277
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:13,891
Who'd attempt suicides for me!

278
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:21,534
He shouldn't have taken a half-dead Mehtab to the doctor in the first place.

279
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,035
Please decide the time for tomorrow.

280
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:27,210
I'll call and tell him.

281
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,195
No --

282
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,902
Please don't call him.

283
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,561
He'd have to apologise

284
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,498
Before you talk to him.

285
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,622
Just fix an appointment.

286
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:38,192
Lubna will call and tell him the time.

287
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:38,950
The same -

288
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,660
9 a.m.

289
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,339
May I go now?

290
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,735
Alright, go.

291
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,770
Yes, come in!

292
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,874
How do I come in?

293
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,445
You've bolted the door!

294
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,360
What's with bolting the door?

295
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,332
I --

296
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,840
Wasn't quite paying attention --

297
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,461
Wasn't quite paying attention -- And -- Bolted it.

298
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:50,800
Beware, Monsieur Afzal.

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
You may get caught!

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,231
Why do you always suspect me?

301
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,200
Ask forgiveness!

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,461
I've never suspected you.

303
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:01,019
I always trust you, but you compel me to doubt!

304
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,166
Alright, please, go. I'm feeling sleepy.

305
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,357
Your phone's ringing.

306
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,044
So it is.

307
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,170
When the phone's with me,

308
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,356
It would ring now and then...

309
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:22,586
Answer it, then.

310
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:24,917
I will.

311
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:28,034
But never before me, eh?

312
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,268
Right...

313
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:32,861
Please, Arifa, leave. I'm very sleepy!

314
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,087
Alright,

315
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,554
Promise me you'd sleep without answering the phone.

316
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,410
It's stopped ringing.

317
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,788
You'll see, it'll ring again soon.

318
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:45,368
And why are you going to bed so early?

319
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:49,573
Mind if I say something to rouse you?

320
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,764
Go on.

321
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,370
Dad's found out that you don't go to your office anymore.

322
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,802
You blew the gaff on me after all!

323
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:04,007
You blew the gaff on me after all!
-He told me himself.

324
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:05,653
Said, 'We are God's men'.

325
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:08,660
'We get the news even when we don't get it'.

326
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,275
You should fear, Afzal.

327
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:12,815
If he indeed gets the news,

328
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:16,039
He'd know who she is.

329
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,972
He may say it over lunch tomorrow,

330
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,207
'Listen, my good man'!

331
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,910
'Her father had come to pray today'.

332
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,420
'Sat with me for long',

333
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,424
And what they talked about in their meeting...

334
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:30,254
God alone knows better.

335
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:31,836
Bolt the door, now,

336
00:18:31,836 --> 00:18:32,860
Answer your phone,

337
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,473
And forget that you'd be able to sleep.

338
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,762
The blighter!

339
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,989
There he is, the geezer!

340
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,699
I mean -- the good man.

341
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,546
Peace, Uncle.

342
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,639
And upon you [as well].

343
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
How are you now?

344
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,265
I'm great.

345
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,856
Alright, then, get ready.

346
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:48,010
You're leaving for Karachi in half an hour.

347
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,005
What?

348
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:51,870
Look, you can't make us accept you as ours,

349
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,060
So it's better you'd not worsen our ties.

350
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,175
Your suicide attempt has embarrassed me greatly.

351
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:00,870
Your mother's almost ready

352
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,275
And waiting for you downstairs.

353
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,002
That which was destined to happen has come to be,

354
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:08,161
So you should better do what's best.

355
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:09,838
May I get ten minutes?

356
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:11,500
For what?

357
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,340
I want to sit on this swing one last time.

358
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,061
Sit, then.

359
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,220
No.

360
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,601
Not before you

361
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,014
But alone.

362
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,918
You may not like to hear it, but

363
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:27,028
Consider this the last wish of one who's about to depart.

364
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,179
Fulfil your wish.

365
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,462
Lubna will come and tell you when ten minutes have passed.

366
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,000
Otherwise, she'll tell me.

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,170
You wouldn't have to bother.

368
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,192
I won't sit here for more than 10 minutes.

369
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,640
Okay.

370
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,736
Come.

371
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,810
Hello?

372
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,365
Peace be upon you.

373
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,177
And upon you.

374
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,067
Why weren't you answering the phone?

375
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,602
Arifa was with me.

376
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:23,212
You could've texted me that she's with you.

377
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:25,417
Next time, I will text.

378
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,484
Alright.

379
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,292
9 a.m. has been decided upon.

380
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,756
9 a.m.?

381
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:30,927
Yes.

382
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,823
You'll go to the office and meet Dad tomorrow morning.

383
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:35,276
I'll meet him.

384
00:21:35,276 --> 00:21:35,844
Right,

385
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:37,587
Don't do anything stupid.

386
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,579
I handled it today, saying

387
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:42,220
That you got angry because of Mehtab.

388
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,887
I'd be out of excuses tomorrow!

389
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,188
I'll be very careful.

390
00:21:47,188 --> 00:21:49,187
You don't worry.

391
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,050
Please, tell me, though,

392
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,596
What if he said,

393
00:21:53,596 --> 00:21:56,736
'I'd like to meet your parents'?

394
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,280
Why, let him meet them!

395
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,319
That would seal everything.

396
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,670
Dad will be delighted to hear,

397
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,404
And exclaim, 'Such is my son's good fortune'!

398
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:07,335
What else am I paying 800,000 for?

399
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:09,047
What?

400
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,266
You forgot already!

401
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:13,568
We'd decided that you'd turn out perfidious in the end!

402
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:16,050
How could I turn out perfidious?

403
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,740
Dad will remain firm over his word.

404
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,256
We don't accept perfidy here.

405
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,460
Don't scare me.

406
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,824
I swear I'm not trying to scare you.

407
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:27,776
I'm afraid myself.

408
00:22:27,776 --> 00:22:29,909
But think over it and tell me,

409
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,145
Must I be perfidious?

410
00:22:32,145 --> 00:22:34,562
There's no other option!

411
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,767
We may just be parted...

412
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,000
What?

413
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,059
I'm saying it right -

414
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,752
It'd do your job, and

415
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,870
Save love from this calumny.

416
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,644
Are you alright?

417
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:49,190
What 'love' and 'calumny' are you talking about?

418
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,330
No, I was just saying --

419
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,810
Love

420
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,720
Is pious

421
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,040
And in perfidy is its calumny.

422
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,890
Yet if that's what you desire, alright,

423
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,750
We'd calumniate it.

424
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,270
Alright, wait.

425
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,977
Let Lubna come; we'll talk then.

426
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:12,263
Should I call later?

427
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,458
No.

428
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,310
I'll call you myself.

429
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,960
Alright.

430
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,312
I'll stay awake.

431
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,975
It would've been better if she'd come too.

432
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:59,896
We'd have seen her face one last time as we left.

433
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:03,115
I think she's retired.

434
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,441
Alright.

435
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,971
As it pleases her...

436
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,742
Come.

437
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,989
Sit.

438
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,936
Come, my dear.

439
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,990
God be with ye.

440
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,242
Bye.

441
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:37,452
Fire!

442
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,627
By God! Fire!

443
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,624
T --
-Where?

444
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:42,942
Mlle Farah's swing on the terrace!

445
00:24:42,942 --> 00:24:45,420
It's all up in flames!

446
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,941
Come!

447
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,210
Quickly! Get some water!

448
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,086
Get some water!

449
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,849
Afzal!

450
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,984
Yes, Dad?

451
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:11,051
You're still awake?

452
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,972
I'm about to sleep, Dad.

453
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:16,150
Go to sleep early, my son.

454
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,001
You have to go to work in the morning.

455
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:21,982
Right, Dad.

456
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,920
Shut up, Lubna!

457
00:27:40,924 --> 00:27:42,627
Sleep peacefully, already!

458
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,497
He would've reached Karachi by now!

459
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,093
Or you could call him

460
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:49,140
And mouth every four-letter word you can!

461
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,726
That's <i>exactly</i> what he wants

462
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:51,599
That I should call

463
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,809
And abuse him!

464
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:55,171
And he'd be delighted to hear them!

465
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,158
I won't insult him

466
00:27:57,158 --> 00:28:00,134
For he doesn't even deserve that.

467
00:28:02,818 --> 00:28:03,933
Hey!

468
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,611
It's 2.30 already!

469
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:07,206
So what?

470
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:09,309
Take another leave.

471
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,341
It's not about taking a leave, Lubna.

472
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:14,705
I'd asked Afzal to wait for my call.

473
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:17,147
When did you say that?

474
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,820
Before the fire started.

475
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,530
Right...

476
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,350
That was three hours ago.

477
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,668
What do I do now?

478
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:27,417
You'd <i>better</i> not call him. The poor man must be sleeping now.

479
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:30,099
But why had you told him you'd call?

480
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,440
I don't know what had gotten into him!

481
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,852
He said,

482
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:37,103
'In perfidy is love's calumny'.

483
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:38,901
'So, instead of that',

484
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:41,110
'We may just be parted'.

485
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,620
He gave me a right fright there.

486
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,539
I said it, promptly,

487
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:45,267
'I'd ask Lubna for advice'

488
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,450
'And then talk to you'.

489
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,821
God...

490
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,581
Think of something!

491
00:28:51,581 --> 00:28:52,323
He said

492
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:54,356
That if Dad invited his parents,

493
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,705
His father would finalise everything that instant!

494
00:28:56,705 --> 00:28:57,993
So let him!

495
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,376
Listen to the whole thing.

496
00:29:00,376 --> 00:29:03,571
His father is the kind who'd stay true to his words.

497
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:04,760
And also

498
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,041
They don't accept perfidy there.

499
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,389
What are you looking at?

500
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,590
I'm not looking...

501
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,242
I'm thinking

502
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:20,591
How fortunate the girl he loves is!

503
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:22,491
As if I care a hoot!

504
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,114
Don't insult love like this.

505
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,898
It afflicts even the likes of you in its anger!

506
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,378
Let's talk business, shall we?

507
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,031
Text him and ask him to postpone the meeting with Dad.

508
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,542
How would he postpone it?

509
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,201
He could call and say,

510
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,192
Something came up and he's got to leave for Karachi,

511
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,042
And it'd take a few days.

512
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,860
What would that do?

513
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,980
Buy a few days' time

514
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,080
To think, strategise, and decide.

515
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,420
But <i>this time</i>,

516
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,747
You'd better both think and strategise.

517
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:50,834
I'd say

518
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,506
Get the poor man out of this trouble too.

519
00:29:53,506 --> 00:29:55,101
Mehtab's gone,

520
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,340
And judging by the way he's left,

521
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,205
I don't think he's ever coming back.

522
00:29:59,205 --> 00:30:00,900
The danger is past.

523
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,674
Now, it's better that you free Afzal too.

524
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:05,490
You're using up all of his girlfriend's time.

525
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,802
This is not fair.

526
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:08,640
Pay him for this farce

527
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,213
And relieve him from this responsibility.

528
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,131
What will I say to Dad?

529
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:15,564
Dad is Dad, after all.

530
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,155
What's the worst that can happen even if he found out the truth?

531
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:19,430
He'd be a bit angry,

532
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,611
But getting angry with you is something he's incapable of,

533
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,013
So, he'd just forgive you and spare himself.

534
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,959
So I should sign a cheque of 800,000?

535
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,052
Sign one.

536
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:31,212
He's hit the jackpot then!

537
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:29,969
'Your work is done... You don't need to meet Dad now... I've signed a cheque of 800,000; collect it from Lubna... Thanks'.

538
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,680
I've made some for you as well.

539
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,417
Have it.

540
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,157
Your suit's in the cupboard,

541
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:43,595
And Eladio polished your shoes last night.

542
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,960
Sit down, will you?

543
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,317
What's the matter?

544
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,750
And what's this?

545
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,934
You came here straight from bed?

546
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:02,052
Why, mate?

547
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:04,063
There's no water here to wash your face.

548
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:05,069
What would you do?

549
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:06,755
I'm not going anywhere.

550
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,888
I've come to meet you.

551
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:10,189
Hey!

552
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:14,095
Weren't you full of yourself last night saying you've got to go there early in the morning?

553
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:18,088
Yesterday's plan ended this morning.

554
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,906
Mind if I ask you something?

555
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,351
Not at all.

556
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:28,331
Is there room for being self-seeking in love?

557
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:30,803
Only in love is there room for being self-seeking, you bugger!

558
00:33:30,803 --> 00:33:31,713
How much?

559
00:33:31,713 --> 00:33:33,394
As much as possible.

560
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:34,948
One's got to be willing

561
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:37,600
To reduce the world to ashes to get one's beloved!

562
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,694
Do you know the last thing Samina had told me?

563
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:41,610
What?

564
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,184
'Elope with me'.

565
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:44,729
'Get legally married to me'.

566
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:47,353
I said, 'You're insane'.

567
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:49,680
She got married ten days later,

568
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,555
And I felt like I lost my sanity.

569
00:33:52,555 --> 00:33:54,637
Remember,

570
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:57,695
Don't turn tail once you fall in love.

571
00:33:57,695 --> 00:34:01,437
Or you'd end up like me, bugger!

572
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:04,959
Today, I listen to others' stories,

573
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,220
And she, her husband's abuses.

574
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,649
I've learnt this at the price of losing her -

575
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,060
Don't think what Dad will say when you fall in love;

576
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,927
See, instead, what your heart says.

577
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,370
Where've you kept the suit?

578
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,228
In the cupboard over there.

579
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,508
So you're going?

580
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,510
Yes.

581
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,741
Hello?

582
00:34:47,741 --> 00:34:50,569
This is Ibrahim speaking.

583
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,650
You don't need to come to the office.

584
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,337
Bring your parents to our place after nightfall.

585
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,660
I'd like to talk to them first.

586
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,370
Tell them they'd be having dinner with us.

587
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,930
Ri -- Right, Uncle.

588
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,530
Alright. Take care.

589
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,030
Okay?

590
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,440
He didn't wash his face and hands,

591
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,050
Didn't change his clothes,

592
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,450
Didn't have breakfast... How did he leave for office?

593
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,583
It's never happened this way before!

594
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:57,934
Leave it be, Dad.

595
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:00,886
You know, too, that he doesn't go to his office now.

596
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:04,250
He does <i>say</i> he's leaving for office.

597
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:09,763
I have a feeling she studies at some university.

598
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:11,907
I have no problem with it,

599
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:16,407
If only the whippersnapper would tell me who she is!

600
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,618
Suspicion isn't justified either, Reverend.

601
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,082
Ask Arifa

602
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,134
If I've ever suspected him,

603
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:29,421
Pronounce a judgement against me.

604
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,310
Dad's right, Mum.

605
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,070
She studies at a university.

606
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,464
See?

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,684
You're back from the office already?

608
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:40,188
I --

609
00:36:40,188 --> 00:36:42,839
I don't go to the office now, Dad.

610
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,119
My job ended on the second day itself.

611
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,930
You could've told me earlier.

612
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,749
I get the news

613
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,802
And get to know everything.

614
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:54,469
Anyway.

615
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:56,978
What have you thought about, now?

616
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:58,964
What would you do?

617
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,096
May I get married, Dad?

618
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,759
In the name of God! [auspicious beginning]

619
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:09,310
Would you tell us after you've tied the knot,

620
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,215
Or invite us too?

621
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:16,045
I hold you very dear, Dad.

622
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:18,707
I fear both your anger and affection,

623
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:21,607
Which is why I make mistakes.

624
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,223
Talk about your marriage.

625
00:37:23,223 --> 00:37:24,989
You're splendid, Reverend.

626
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,876
How can he get married?

627
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:30,183
He's got no job and earns nothing.

628
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:33,667
And only God knows who's the one he's <i>carrying on with</i>!

629
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:36,888
Sh -- She's pure and fair.

630
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,458
But

631
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,181
I'm not getting married just yet.

632
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,620
I just want you to

633
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,770
Get things started.

634
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:49,454
Get things started with whom?

635
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,915
With Monseigneur Sheikh Ibrahim.

636
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,610
How does Monseigneur know her?

637
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,030
She's --

638
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,774
Monseigneur's --

639
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:03,786
Daughter.

640
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,524
What?

641
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,380
Wha --

642
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,703
Come again? What --?

643
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:15,340
Did you hear what he just said?

644
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,870
No, I'd say you tell me again --

645
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,528
Wh -- What do you want to say? I --

646
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,230
I couldn't quite get it --

647
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,877
Wha -- What do you want to say?

648
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:28,560
I --

649
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,314
I'm talking about Monseigneur.

650
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,479
It's fine up to that point.

651
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,670
But I think I heard that you...

652
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,456
Are talking about his daughter.

653
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:41,685
I'm --

654
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,841
I'm going to marry his daughter.

655
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,748
There he is saying it again.

656
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:49,713
I mean,

657
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:55,052
One who'd not give him a job has agreed to give him his daughter.

658
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,700
His pulse is alright,

659
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,043
Nor has he got a fever...

660
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:06,183
Still, it'd be better if you see a doctor.

661
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,820
Someone like me

662
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,831
Cannot know about the afflictions of the mind.

663
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:14,156
He's invited the two of you

664
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:15,274
To dinner

665
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:16,971
After the night prayer.

666
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:21,117
He's saying the same thing again, Ruqaiyya; tell him

667
00:39:21,117 --> 00:39:24,824
That excesses of either delight or shock are bad for me

668
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:27,550
And if something happened to me,

669
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,380
Your Afzal would be responsible for it!

670
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,478
Dad, I'm telling the truth!

671
00:39:33,478 --> 00:39:35,821
Keep on saying that, my good man.

672
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:38,809
I can't believe it.

673
00:39:39,154 --> 00:39:41,704
I'd have gone up to the terrace for a stroll

674
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:44,307
Were it not so sunny!

675
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:46,041
Afzal's right.

676
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,646
My friend, Lubna -

677
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,740
She's the one who writes him letters!

678
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,847
She even calls him.

679
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,420
I'd answered once too!

680
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,717
I think she's been successful!

681
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:56,746
She would've convinced her father!

682
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:57,907
No -- It's --

683
00:39:57,907 --> 00:39:59,899
Not Lubna!

684
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,491
Ask me first!

685
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:15,003
You just saw the name on the phone and said what you figured before everyone!

686
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,702
It's not Lubna.

687
00:40:19,702 --> 00:40:21,582
Then?

688
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,000
Farah.

689
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
