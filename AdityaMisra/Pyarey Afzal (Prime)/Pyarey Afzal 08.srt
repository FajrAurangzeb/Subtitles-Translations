1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,560
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,832
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:22,930
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:29,376
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:34,880
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,369
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,436
'Everything'?

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,416
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:12,897
Right,

10
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:14,787
So what's 'everything'?

11
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:16,387
I wanted to say that

12
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:20,427
It is not meet, considering my status, that I love Farah,

13
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:24,137
But I have a right to love Farah.

14
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,818
Oh?

15
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,700
Who bestowed this right upon you?

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,048
No...

17
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,946
Nobody bestows this right,

18
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:33,727
Nor does anyone ask for it.

19
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:37,150
Or else, one would have to take permission before falling in love.

20
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,551
It would make a complete haymes of it all.

21
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,532
A complete haymes, as in?

22
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:44,742
As in, asking permission

23
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,170
Of the one you love first.

24
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,699
Mention your status,

25
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,137
And ask,

26
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:52,759
'May I love you'?

27
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,607
What would you take to <i>just</i> love her?

28
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,887
Another good question.

29
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:04,447
I've asked you something.

30
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:08,943
How much money would you take to spare her life?

31
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:15,770
The thing is, I've promised on oath to Dad I'd never gamble again.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm not talking about gambling.

33
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,740
Only that you <i>are</i> talking about gambling.

34
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,254
But it seems you do not understand gambling.

35
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:25,425
My friend, Babloo,

36
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:29,065
He says, 'Win the match, and the money's all yours'.

37
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,115
And you're saying, 'Lose the match, and the money's all yours'.

38
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:36,158
There is no room for such match-fixing in love.

39
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:40,458
Love is all about striving all your life and dying for its sake.

40
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,169
You play to win

41
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:45,241
Even if it gets heavy on the pocket.

42
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:48,902
It seems your mind doesn't quite work.

43
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,589
You're talking like Dad!

44
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,025
Whenever I used to score third division marks on my exams,

45
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:55,830
Dad would say,

46
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,967
'Look at this, Ruqaiyya'!

47
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:02,137
'It seems your son has not a brain in his skull'!

48
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,737
Ruqaiyya is my Mum's name.

49
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:06,737
Your family must be chuffed.

50
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:10,910
You've trapped such a good and wealthy girl.

51
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,806
Isn't it so?

52
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:18,997
This line is not worthy of my reply.

53
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,750
If you have any other questions, please do ask. Otherwise, I would take my leave.

54
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,338
To be honest, I'm rather furious at this.

55
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,360
Thank you very much.

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,491
You gave me a chance to speak my heart out.

57
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:40,862
But your last question wasn't nice.

58
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:42,413
Regardless,

59
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,492
I'd like to tell you as I leave

60
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:48,183
Nobody in my family knows that I love Farah.

61
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,126
With peace.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,605
He's left already?

63
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,815
Yes.

64
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:15,836
But

65
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:18,506
I'd said he should leave only after meeting me.

66
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,826
You met with so much jewellery on?

67
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,156
He must've been frightened.

68
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:23,326
No.

69
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:25,916
The wretch doesn't fear anything.

70
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,947
Answered me back rather artfully on everything!

71
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:32,837
It is today that I realised how torturous it is to be the mother of a girl

72
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:36,558
Who's fallen for a right dosser from the neighbourhood.

73
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:38,407
Did you call him a dosser too?

74
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,388
I didn't.

75
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:44,990
But it occurred to me every now and then - who am I talking to, and about what!

76
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,676
What happened?

77
00:04:46,676 --> 00:04:48,587
Did he not agree to a million?

78
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,876
He left, calling me a gambler!

79
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,747
How dare he!

80
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:55,428
He said you're a gambler?

81
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,690
When I asked him how much he'd take to spare Farah's life, he said he'd promised his father.

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,316
'I'll never gamble again'.

83
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:08,180
When did he call you a gambler?

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,126
When I said, 'I'm not talking about gambling'.

85
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:14,257
He said, 'Only that you <i>are</i> talking about gambling',

86
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:16,867
'But it seems you do not understand gambling'.

87
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,777
He said, 'My friend, Babloo',

88
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,117
'He says',

89
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:21,378
'"Win the match",'

90
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,408
'"And the money's all yours".'

91
00:05:22,408 --> 00:05:23,708
'And you're saying',

92
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,069
'"Lose the match",'

93
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,850
'"And the money's all yours".'

94
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,371
So he <i>actually</i> called you a gambler!

95
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't be angry over it.

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,839
I'll see to it.

97
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,296
And where are both the girls?

98
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,866
Upstairs.

99
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:43,636
I'd asked them not to come downstairs

100
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,736
Until he's left.

101
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,590
Good.

102
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,826
And yes,

103
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:53,461
That line about Babloo was perfect!

104
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,437
Mum would've had a canary at that moment!

105
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:56,582
Canary?

106
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:57,570
In Eire,

107
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,831
You 'have a canary' when you get all worked up!

108
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:00,991
To be quite honest,

109
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:02,841
Afzal's won the first match.

110
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,541
Mum has lost by ten wickets!

111
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,641
Ten wickets!

112
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,954
Wickets or lines,

113
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:10,080
One or the same.

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,731
His ten lines, to Mum,

115
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,490
Are like ten wickets lost.

116
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,631
He bowled Mum out on every line of hers!

117
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,762
No need to get so excited.

118
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,152
Dad will decide to call Mehtab

119
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:23,082
Only after he meets Dad.

120
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,890
Why didn't he meet Dad, though?

121
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,677
We'd told him he'd be meeting Dad after meeting Mum.

122
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:28,557
The same

123
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,436
That I said in Irish!

124
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,076
Irish?

125
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:34,777
He's had Mum have a canary!

126
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:38,040
Then he'll be as vulnerable as a canary before Dad!

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,546
I have nothing to fear now.

128
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,217
I trust him.

129
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,888
And I trust him too!

130
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:46,479
No problem.

131
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,730
Tomorrow, he'll be meeting Dad.

132
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,051
You'll see.

133
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:52,612
Tomorrow, Dad will call bleeding Mehtab and say,

134
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,893
'Scurry away, you whippersnapper'!

135
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,400
Care to tell me where you're coming from <i>now</i>?

136
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,144
Did you go on a date?

137
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:28,870
You're coming after meeting her, eh?

138
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,656
Wearing a new suit, eh, you bugger?

139
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,820
Seems it's more than a 'meeting'.

140
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,796
Innit? Tell me.

141
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:40,506
I won't tell a thing.

142
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,271
You guard the honour

143
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:46,331
Of those you love, mate.

144
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,587
This bugger's trying to dupe us!

145
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,400
Here.

146
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
Your clothes have been ironed.

147
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,181
Put this on and get going!

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,256
You're not our type anymore.

149
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,966
Thank you, Timmy.

150
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,037
Leave it be, Afzal.

151
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:05,906
I'm not Sajid

152
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,153
Who'd be ensnared in your sweet talk.

153
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:11,511
You only use friends for your own ends.

154
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,697
I love the three of you so much.

155
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:17,558
I don't use you for my ends.

156
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,840
I swear by her.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,526
Take his word for it, mate.

158
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:31,040
He doesn't lie when he swears by her.

159
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,490
Innit?

160
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,767
Praise the Lord.

161
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,656
O God, the most excellent one! Have mercy.

162
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:54,049
May my greetings reach your ears too!

163
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:55,496
They have reached.

164
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,756
And upon you, peace.

165
00:08:57,756 --> 00:09:01,043
Wash your hands and rinse your mouth; I'll be serving dinner.

166
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:04,100
I'm a Reverend, Ruqaiyya Begum.

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,406
My hands and my mouth are always clean.

168
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:08,854
And

169
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:12,935
Where is your most excellent one [Afzal]?

170
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:19,775
Do you remember when I'd asked you to give him a humbler name

171
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,115
For you may have to pay for it otherwise?

172
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,126
Stay quiet, Reverend!

173
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:28,190
If names made any difference, you wouldn't be 'Subhanallah' ['God's perfected Creation'] either!

174
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,377
My father named me.

175
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:36,488
When I was born, he saw me and exclaimed, 'Subhanallah' [Praise the Lord]!

176
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:37,968
And my mother said,

177
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:39,760
'That's the perfect name'!

178
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,336
If

179
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:43,167
Mum were alive today,

180
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,057
She'd ask you,

181
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,306
'Who's the greater one [Afzal] -'

182
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:50,037
'The one named Afzal',

183
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:53,418
'Or my Subhanallah'?

184
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:58,059
Who's that?

185
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:01,280
Your Subhanallah!

186
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,726
Oh...

187
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,991
God is the Greatest...

188
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,802
Peace, Dad.

189
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,850
And upon you, peace.

190
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,996
Peace, dear Mum.

191
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:59,590
And upon you, peace. May you live long.

192
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,000
Where are you coming from

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
At 9.30 p.m.?

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,986
By the Lord, Reverend,

195
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:07,030
Let him catch his breath.

196
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,141
Yes, do catch your breath.

197
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,321
Take in a gulp of air,

198
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:14,520
And then tell me where you're coming from.

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,080
You -- didn't tell Dad?

200
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,590
I was about to when you came.

201
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,616
I was meeting the boss.

202
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,010
Took quite some time.

203
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,897
Alright.

204
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,458
I hope he's satisfied with you?

205
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,486
Yes.

206
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:34,566
He's begun to give you a lot of attention.

207
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:35,487
Otherwise,

208
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,618
These

209
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:38,548
Mill owners

210
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:42,219
Don't usually talk to office clerks.

211
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:45,539
I mean,

212
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,654
He's seen your talent clearly.

213
00:11:49,654 --> 00:11:50,770
Monseigneur is

214
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,980
Quite adept at

215
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,931
Seeing through people

216
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:55,839
My dear,

217
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,852
Please don't listen to what your Dad is saying.

218
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:00,502
He was just recounting how, when he was born,

219
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:05,103
His father exclaimed on seeing him, 'Praise the Lord' [Subhanallah]!

220
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,684
Why are you so hesitant?

221
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,216
Give her a befitting reply!

222
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:23,342
I've been embarrassed because of what I've said,

223
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,512
What do I say now?

224
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,063
If, before me

225
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,610
Stood my wife,

226
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,671
I would've replied to her,

227
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:33,810
But Afzal's mother stands before me right now.

228
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,046
Forgive me, Madame.

229
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,357
'Clerk' just slipped out.

230
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,503
Here, have this.

231
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,447
Eat properly.

232
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:13,348
Or is it that you've decided to die without him?

233
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,809
What are you doing, Irsa?

234
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,121
I think -- I'm --

235
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm having a nightmare.

236
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,110
I can see

237
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,557
That blighter coming here with a wedding procession.

238
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,971
No --

239
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,187
I won't be able to see this, Monseigneur!

240
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:56,870
What will we tell people?

241
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,687
What will we say when questioned by our own family?

242
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:01,890
I don't have an answer.

243
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,527
And I'm sure it's the same with you.

244
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:06,655
Or --

245
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:09,110
Or will you proudly say

246
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,137
That your daughter has married the one she loves?

247
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,147
Neither seeing his status or family background,

248
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:16,531
Nor seeing where and how he'd keep her,

249
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,700
When he'll earn and what he'll be able to feed her --

250
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,697
We'll think, Irsa.

251
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:23,510
Let's talk about it later.
-What do you mean, talk later?

252
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,237
We'll have to agree to it now, Monseigneur!

253
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,873
It's just like I've seen in countless films and dramas!

254
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:31,111
When girls want to impose their desires,

255
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:34,020
This is how they quieten!

256
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,676
They eat slowly, and

257
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,046
And eat little.

258
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,891
There!

259
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:42,512
Look at her cohort!

260
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:44,173
She'll tell her now

261
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,932
That I was saying something against her

262
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,913
While her Dad was quiet.

263
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,583
Mum, I'm going because I've had my dinner...

264
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,882
Oh, please!

265
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:59,943
Even if she wanted this badge of unseemliness, she could've drooled over someone who's not from the neighbourhood!
-Mind your tongue, Irsa. Please.

266
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,830
Go, my dear.

267
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,806
That's not how you talk to daughters, Irsa.

268
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:18,500
Granted, she's made a mistake

269
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,972
She doesn't eat enough, stays quiet...

270
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,637
Perhaps she, too, thinks,

271
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:25,234
'What am I doing'?

272
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:28,748
Give her some time.

273
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,838
Don't start insulting her.

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,710
Afzal?

275
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,996
Dad's calling you for dinner.

276
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,257
Afzal?

277
00:16:05,627 --> 00:16:08,971
Are you sleeping or just pretending to?

278
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,717
Afzal!

279
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,406
Afzal!

280
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,136
Mum! Dad!

281
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,490
Afzal's got a scorching fever!

282
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,741
Good Lord...

283
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,796
Go right now

284
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:43,156
And tell Mum you were lying.

285
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:45,800
And tell her that I was in on it too!

286
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,167
Tell her that you don't love Afzal,

287
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,938
Nor does he love you!

288
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,376
Just -- We'd hired him to 'love',

289
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:57,587
But don't tell her about the money.

290
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:58,950
Or else, she'd say,

291
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,760
'200,000 a month'

292
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,217
'To a third division BA'?

293
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,936
Have a glass of water,

294
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:06,177
Ease yourself,

295
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,551
And then we'll talk.

296
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,620
To the dickens with easing!

297
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,580
Mum was hurling such insults

298
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,460
That would embarrass even sworn enemies!

299
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,917
And save this glass of water for yourself

300
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,477
For you'll be needing it in a while!

301
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,508
Tell me,

302
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,020
What did Mum say?

303
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,150
Fear God, Farah!

304
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,310
You'd die when you hear it!

305
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,900
Alright, I'll die.

306
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,707
But please tell me the whole thing first!

307
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,756
You'll shriek so loud...

308
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:36,726
Let me shriek!

309
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:38,587
Don't worry.

310
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,236
Okay.

311
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:43,730
Shall we sit?

312
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,550
Why sit?

313
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,350
For the love of God, just sit!

314
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,545
You may plummet when you hear it!

315
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,365
Peace be upon you.

316
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,541
And upon you, peace.

317
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,146
What happened, Monseigneur?

318
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,111
I've got a feeling

319
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,522
My blood pressure's high.

320
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:16,652
I'll check right away.

321
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:20,575
Sorry, but

322
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,211
It took me a while.

323
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,048
The Reverend showed up as I stepped out.

324
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:28,098
Who?

325
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:29,332
Reverend Subhanallah?

326
00:18:29,332 --> 00:18:30,429
Yes.

327
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,911
His son's got a 103 fever.

328
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:39,589
And he was even afraid to tell that he'd gotten drenched in the rain!

329
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,190
The lads these days!

330
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,100
Alright, please don't speak now.

331
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,022
In the name of God.

332
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:07,830
Peace be upon you.

333
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,601
And upon you, peace.

334
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,266
O Lord, the healer of all illnesses...

335
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:19,050
What's his temperature?
-103.

336
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,750
103?
-It's two degrees lower now.

337
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,896
Don't worry.

338
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,810
The doctor didn't let him come home until the temperature started falling.

339
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,790
And

340
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,320
The doctor's advised him to have some tea with rusks.

341
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,380
So,

342
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,000
Get some tea,
-Yes, go.

343
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,651
I'll get some rusks.
-I'll go, Dad.

344
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,262
Sit down.
-No, my son.

345
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:47,483
Sit down and relax.

346
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:48,874
Get some rest.

347
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:51,114
And tell your mother

348
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:55,255
Where you got drenched in the rain!

349
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,426
Where did you get drenched?

350
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,886
Your clothes were all dry.

351
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:07,568
That -- I -- The doctor

352
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:09,985
Was asking too many questions.

353
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:12,476
'What did you eat, drink; how did you get this fever',

354
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:15,740
So I just said that I got drenched in the rain.

355
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,040
You lied to the doctor?

356
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,697
I didn't lie, Mum.

357
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,697
I did get a bit wet...

358
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,248
It was quite the downpour!

359
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,010
But you were inside your office.

360
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,626
No, Mum, I'm not inside the office at all times.

361
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,256
There's no roof overhead

362
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:34,380
When you go from Accounts to Production.

363
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,890
Besides,

364
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,666
What's the worst that can happen if you get drenched in the season's rains?

365
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,079
You can have a fever!

366
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,940
103!

367
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:46,627
You --

368
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,080
Get me some tea.

369
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm hungry.

370
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,227
Go!

371
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,576
It would've been better if you'd bought a thermometer too.

372
00:20:56,576 --> 00:20:58,479
I'll keep on having doubts

373
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,266
When the wretched fever will wear off...

374
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:03,516
It'll wear off as soon as I've had some of Arifa's tea.

375
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,030
Lie down.

376
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,797
Just for a while. Here.

377
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,706
Wait while she gets you some tea.

378
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,986
Would you tell me what happened?

379
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,566
It may have hurt you,

380
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:25,076
But at least it didn't hurt our reputation.

381
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,100
I don't have the slightest sorrow.

382
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,570
If Mum started talking like this,

383
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,650
You won't find a place to bury your head with shame.

384
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,550
She said it before Dad...

385
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,736
God forgive...

386
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,840
Alright,

387
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,480
I accept it's our fault,

388
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,658
But we should be granted at least a shred of clemency.

389
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,640
Please, go on.

390
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,842
She must've been delighted to hear it.

391
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,922
I didn't talk to her.

392
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:08,318
Hey!

393
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,563
You'd marched from here as if

394
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,685
You'd create quite the racket there.

395
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,484
What happened?

396
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:16,433
Dad's unwell.

397
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,434
His blood pressure's shot up!

398
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,550
The doctor just left after examining him.

399
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,360
I turned back the moment I heard it...

400
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,287
Imagine what would happen if Dad heard it.

401
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,230
Don't worry.

402
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,250
I'll tell her in the morning --
-Don't wait until the morning.

403
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,280
Tell me whatever you want to right now.

404
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,246
Mum...

405
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,616
I was furious at that blighter,

406
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,980
And I vented all my anger on you.

407
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,827
I've heard it somewhere

408
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:56,010
That a mother's insult is not an insult.

409
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,170
If you still think

410
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,333
That I insulted you, please forgive me.

411
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:02,027
What's this you're saying?

412
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,867
It's far more insulting

413
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:07,218
That you're asking forgiveness of me.

414
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,350
Get me through to him.

415
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,750
Who?

416
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,546
That blighter, obviously!

417
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,689
I'd deliberately had him stand

418
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,310
In the rain.

419
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,286
I thought he'd look dishevelled

420
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:25,497
Drenched like that.

421
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:27,428
But I never thought

422
00:23:27,428 --> 00:23:30,279
He could get a 103 fever.

423
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:32,520
He's gotten a 103 fever?

424
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,180
As if you don't know!

425
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,641
I swear I don't.

426
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,101
Would you look at that?

427
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,301
He's trounced me again!

428
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:43,772
He didn't even complain to you about how I treated him!

429
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:46,792
This is Reverend Subhanallah's upbringing!

430
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,877
The poor lad's a 3rd division BA,

431
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:52,940
But a 1st division in the elegance of his manners.

432
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,386
When you ask about his health,

433
00:23:55,386 --> 00:23:59,747
Please do ask him to come and meet your father when he's well.

434
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,346
Good morning!

435
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,587
It's 'Peace be upon you', not 'Good morning'!

436
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:50,170
Well, peace be upon you, but where are you off to?

437
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,606
You didn't wake me up? It's 8 already!

438
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:54,226
Where do you have to go?

439
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,196
Good question, where do I go everyday?

440
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,857
Call in sick, then.

441
00:24:57,857 --> 00:25:00,840
Tell them you got drenched going to the Production wing from Accounts

442
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,706
And got a fever. Ask for a day's leave.

443
00:25:03,706 --> 00:25:06,553
And if you think the mill will close down if you don't go,

444
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:07,984
You may go right now.

445
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:11,744
There's another ironed pair of trousers and shirt in the cupboard.

446
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,901
I'm thinking, too, that I'd rather not go...

447
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,570
A 103 fever's no trifle.

448
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,270
What could I do now?

449
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,016
Great.

450
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,802
Why 'great'?

451
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,930
I'm happy to hear your decision.

452
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,183
It has saved you a pointless perplexity.

453
00:25:31,183 --> 00:25:32,394
What kind of perplexity?

454
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:34,495
A job's a job after all!

455
00:25:34,495 --> 00:25:35,720
Please, go now.

456
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,746
I'll get you breakfast in a few minutes.

457
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,777
This is also the first time you've said 'Please, go now'!

458
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:47,382
It didn't exactly please me.

459
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,497
Don't you intend to go to University?

460
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,767
Is it morning already?

461
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,388
What?

462
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,949
The sun's come up...

463
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,976
So you've been awake all night?

464
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,877
No...

465
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:12,446
I'm growing dozy now...

466
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:14,856
Mind if I doze off?

467
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:17,386
Not at all...

468
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,426
Could've at least called him.

469
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:37,349
Mum would never forgive herself if he died...

470
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,826
Why don't you call him?

471
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,767
He'll talk to you if he's alive.

472
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,501
He'll stay quiet if I call him,

473
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,540
And I'll think

474
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,771
He's no more.

475
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,936
Where are you? I've brought breakfast.

476
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:15,106
I'm in the bathroom. Brushing.

477
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:18,307
I'll keep it on the table.

478
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:22,908
Alright; keep my medicine on the table too.

479
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,476
Where's your medicine?

480
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,295
Right under the pillow.

481
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,780
Hello.

482
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,357
I've heard you've gotten a 103 fever?

483
00:29:01,357 --> 00:29:03,573
I've gotten you all drenched in the rain, haven't I?

484
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:05,973
I'm so sorry...

485
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,235
You're taking the medicine along!

486
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,969
I thought

487
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:34,200
I'd take it.

488
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,761
Such a medicine will be invented some day, won't it,

489
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:38,930
That the sister takes,

490
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,111
And the brother gets cured,

491
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,672
Completely cured?

492
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,136
Alright. Have your breakfast, take your medicine.

493
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,747
Forget your job and get some rest.

494
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:51,228
In fact,

495
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:52,740
Give me your office phone number.

496
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,200
I'll call and tell them that Afzal's unwell and won't be coming today.

497
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,431
No -- Not at all.

498
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,291
I'll call.

499
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,262
I'll tell them.

500
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,080
Don't worry, okay?

501
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,497
The two of you didn't go to University today?

502
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,887
How could I go alone?

503
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:14,000
She's lying in the arms of Morpheus.

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,901
She's been awake all night.

505
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,706
Because of me.

506
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,536
In fact, because of you.

507
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:27,406
Even if I'd said something, why did you have to tell her?

508
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,576
When did she fall asleep?

509
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:32,067
Just some 15 minutes ago.

510
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:35,418
How's Afzal now?

511
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:36,981
How do I know?

512
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:38,858
You could've called and asked!

513
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:42,538
Whatever he's like, he's sick.

514
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,258
Because of me.

515
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:48,345
Why have you started blaming yourself?

516
00:31:48,345 --> 00:31:50,638
I asked the poor lad twice to have some tea.

517
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:54,329
But I don't know what had gotten into him; he said, 'I won't'.

518
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,679
Or perhaps

519
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:00,359
It was just something I'd said...

520
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:02,570
By the way,

521
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,000
To be quite honest...

522
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,987
Yes?

523
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:06,680
He doesn't know how to show anger.

524
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,086
He shows the same old expression all the time.

525
00:32:09,086 --> 00:32:11,147
I don't think he watches any films or dramas.

526
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:11,857
Actually,

527
00:32:11,857 --> 00:32:13,447
I think he must be into films.

528
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:15,397
So what if he's a Reverend's son?

529
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:17,820
After all, he's a lad from the neighbourhood!

530
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,752
Do you know,

531
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:22,010
The rapscallion smiled even as I said things

532
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,452
That would make one's face redden with rage!

533
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,266
Hello?

534
00:32:42,476 --> 00:32:43,947
Right.

535
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,667
Afzal speaking.

536
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,697
I know.

537
00:32:46,697 --> 00:32:49,077
Has your fever worn off?

538
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:50,976
It has.

539
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:53,491
But who told you?

540
00:32:53,491 --> 00:32:57,020
We keep tabs on our office staff.

541
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,154
Hey!

542
00:32:58,154 --> 00:33:01,035
Farah is very satisfied with you!

543
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,516
Oh?

544
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:05,387
What a performance!

545
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:09,366
It felt like a scene from 'Romeo and Juliet'!

546
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,426
Which scene?

547
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:13,510
Oh?

548
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,270
So you do watch films after all!

549
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,660
You would remember that balcony scene.

550
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,916
What perfect lines by Juliet!

551
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,667
Did I say it like that?

552
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,118
That had been said rather rebelliously,

553
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:27,140
You said it all with a smile!

554
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,966
But --

555
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,256
She --

556
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:32,102
Does she think I said it well enough too?

557
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:34,077
She's raving mad about you!

558
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:38,927
She was saying before the meeting, 'Our punter will surely win this round'!

559
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:40,927
Punter?

560
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:42,558
She didn't exactly say 'punter',

561
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,133
That's just something I uttered...

562
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,886
When do I meet Monseigneur?

563
00:33:48,886 --> 00:33:50,421
Get better first.

564
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,411
Let the fever wear off for good

565
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:54,632
And then we'll fix a date for that.

566
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:57,642
No, please do fix a date.

567
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,463
The fever's worn off.

568
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:02,914
Don't worry.

569
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:04,870
I'll win again.

570
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,991
You're real cute, you punter!

571
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:11,830
You want to finish 4 months of work in 4 days and take your 800,000?

572
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,920
No!

573
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,987
If I did that, I'd be charged with a grave sin!

574
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,968
When we'd negotiated it for four months,

575
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,681
My four months are hers.

576
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:23,599
Besides,

577
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,699
I needed a job.

578
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,649
My family's delighted too.

579
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,306
I've started down the path of righteousness.

580
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:33,177
Alright.

581
00:34:33,177 --> 00:34:36,738
We'll fix a meeting for tomorrow when she wakes up.

582
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,666
She's sleeping?

583
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:41,687
She's just fallen asleep.

584
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,837
Got furious last night over something,

585
00:34:43,837 --> 00:34:47,078
And stayed awake in her anger all night.

586
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,347
Oh...

587
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,030
Mind if I ask you something?

588
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,797
Please, ask away.

589
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:56,290
What you say doesn't quite match your reputation.

590
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,386
Tell me,

591
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,907
Are you like this, or have you just become like this?

592
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,151
Good question.

593
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:07,712
Alright. I got it.

594
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:08,801
I'll get back to you.

595
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,561
I'll call in the evening when I've talked to Farah. Bye.

596
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:13,072
Bye.

597
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,311
Shall I take the dishes if you've had your breakfast?

598
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:21,801
Yes, I have. Take them away.

599
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,641
Would you look at this phone?

600
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,706
It's new.

601
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:32,647
It cost 40,000.

602
00:35:32,647 --> 00:35:35,290
Where'd you get 40,000?

603
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,036
Where would I get it from?

604
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:39,786
The office fellows bought me this.

605
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:40,947
Wow...

606
00:35:40,947 --> 00:35:44,197
A phone worth 40,000 for a clerk?

607
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:46,678
You've hit the jackpot!

608
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,714
Jackpot?

609
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,520
What's this you're saying?

610
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,123
That is what one would say to your type.

611
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:57,090
You're green with envy...

612
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,490
Don't show it to Dad.

613
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,761
If he gets envious,

614
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,654
It'd paint the world green.

615
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,576
Ruqaiyya!

616
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,941
Pray tell, sire.

617
00:36:16,687 --> 00:36:19,286
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

618
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:22,071
You're talking with such respect!

619
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:24,556
I respect you so much.

620
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,076
I have to.

621
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:28,097
It's an old order to me.

622
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:30,050
Pray tell. What is it?

623
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:35,400
The two of you are all so occupied looking after Afzal today

624
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,397
That nobody served me breakfast!

625
00:36:38,397 --> 00:36:39,498
Sit down.

626
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,597
I'll serve you breakfast.

627
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:44,008
Thank you so much!

628
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,157
Otherwise

629
00:36:45,157 --> 00:36:46,878
I was beginning to think

630
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:49,758
I'd have to get drenched in the rain,

631
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:52,229
And get a 103 fever

632
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:55,610
To earn such respect!

633
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,589
They say you should say something nice

634
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,720
Even if you don't look so good.

635
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,700
You're saying this a bit browned off...

636
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,180
Otherwise

637
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,701
You used to say before Mr Afzal came of age,

638
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:15,131
'There is no other'

639
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:17,542
'Like you, Reverend'.

640
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,143
I say it to this day.

641
00:37:19,143 --> 00:37:23,006
By the grace of God, there is none like you.

642
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,302
But try to understand what that really means.

643
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,942
May I go and meet some of my friends?

644
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:38,716
Are you asking me?

645
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:40,114
Yes.

646
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,216
No!

647
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:45,193
Ask your mother about

648
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:48,544
Such ill-fated zeal!

649
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:55,248
So, Ruqaiyya Begum, please tell him if he may go and visit his friends.

650
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:56,783
Go, my dear.

651
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:58,740
But come back quickly.

652
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,289
There!

653
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:04,230
That's how you should be asking!

654
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,290
Go; it's a great day to be you!

655
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,580
But please tell me before you leave

656
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,413
If you've taken your medicine.

657
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:13,993
I have.

658
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:16,604
Then, I'd request you

659
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:21,525
To come home before it's time for your next dose.

660
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:22,955
Yes.

661
00:38:22,955 --> 00:38:25,195
God be with ye.

662
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,948
Alright now, get me some breakfast.

663
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,333
God is the Greatest...

664
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,726
92,

665
00:38:46,726 --> 00:38:48,116
93,

666
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:49,057
94,

667
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,497
95,

668
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:52,468
96,

669
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:54,553
98...

670
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,867
But that's all there was!
