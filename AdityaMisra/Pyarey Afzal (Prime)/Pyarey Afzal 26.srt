1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,850
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,110
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,269
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,580
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:36,145
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,436
He's talking about running away!

8
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:32,910
Although I scolded him the moment I heard it,

9
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,942
His words have stuck with me.

10
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,711
Well, you don't really care

11
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,260
Whether he stays here or runs away,

12
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,936
To Jasmine or someone else,

13
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,131
It won't change anything for you.

14
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:48,131
I do care.

15
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,246
I'm worried about

16
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:51,770
What'd happen to you.

17
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,996
What'd happen to me?

18
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:54,669
He's running away from <i>you</i>, too.

19
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:57,460
Which means he doesn't love you either.

20
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,996
He is in love,

21
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,507
But he's afraid to speak up.

22
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:02,257
He's not expressive.

23
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:03,807
Go and talk to him,

24
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,158
Have him swear on you...

25
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,258
Say...

26
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,860
'May you leave this place over my dead body'!

27
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,881
Hey!

28
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:12,287
That'll sort everything out.

29
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,807
If he swore on you and left,

30
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,196
Just think

31
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:16,776
That he's very expressive.

32
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:18,399
That he says the truth to someone's face.

33
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,390
No way!

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,366
If I have him swear with such audacity,

35
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,427
He'd think I'm head over heels for him.

36
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:26,240
Then tell him you're head over heels for him. What's the shame now?

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,856
It isn't about shame...

38
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,977
A girl's got to have some ego, Farah.

39
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,137
Should I talk?

40
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,900
I'll talk <i>and</i> have him swear!

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,597
Hold on, Farah! What are you doing?
-Let go of my hand!

42
00:02:37,597 --> 00:02:40,146
I won't let the blighter run away from everywhere!

43
00:02:40,146 --> 00:02:42,287
Look at how much Mum and Dad are running around for him!

44
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,287
He should understand what that means, shouldn't he?

45
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,468
And how much longer will you keep singing 'I've tasted blood'?

46
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,740
Your voice is bad, sure, but your feeling surely isn't, right?

47
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,426
Wait, Farah! What are you doing?

48
00:02:52,426 --> 00:02:53,550
Listen to me!

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,420
By the Lord --

50
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,226
Did you see that?

51
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:18,166
It's happened, hasn't it?

52
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,836
What happened?

53
00:03:20,836 --> 00:03:22,650
Afzal's run away!

54
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,850
What?

55
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,280
He told the doctor, 'I've started walking now',

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,060
'I'd run away by the evening'.

57
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,876
That's very unfortunate, Irsa...

58
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:35,087
What would I tell the Reverend, now?

59
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,446
Why should you tell anything?

60
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:37,915
He'd have to answer himself!

61
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:40,010
Why are we responsible for his doing?

62
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,096
Hold it, Farah!

63
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:46,560
Just think of where he'd go in the condition he ran away in!

64
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
To Jasmine's?

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,647
Well, you can't think of anything else!

66
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,913
So, where'd he go?

67
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,238
Looking for Wali.

68
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:55,740
The one who'd murdered Babu Hamid.

69
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,497
And remember, all of you,

70
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:04,382
Everyone would hear very bad news by the evening if he found Wali.

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,716
Who knows what'd befall the Reverend...

72
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:19,721
The next bit of news might as well kill him.

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,046
Can you see that?

74
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,857
This way leads to Sea View.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
That means

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,657
The sea is right where it once was.

77
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,816
Alright, now...

78
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:13,413
Ask how far their place is.

79
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:16,287
How far is it, good man?

80
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,407
We'll be there in 15 minutes.

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,940
Please, Ruqaiyya Begum,

82
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,196
Hold on to yourself today.

83
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:32,747
Don't slap him in your fury.

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,566
Right...

85
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:40,460
Many people would hear the whack of a slap,

86
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,471
And if Farah and Lubna

87
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,122
Happened to be there,

88
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:49,572
You could safely say all of Karachi is listening.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,681
Good evening, Modryb.

90
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:05,617
Good evening.

91
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,056
Come in.

92
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:09,870
I can't believe it, Modryb.

93
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,850
Don't worry, you will when the two of you have met.

94
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,041
What's this, Wali?

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,012
You've brought your cronies along today, too?

96
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,021
No, Modryb, they're not cronies.

97
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:21,670
I've got a wedding procession with me.
-Oh?

98
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,156
So you've fully prepared, too?

99
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,140
Come in.

100
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,567
C'mon.

101
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,387
Good evening.

102
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,178
Very very good evening.

103
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,000
Sit.

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,140
How --

105
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,931
How much I've fought for this one moment!

106
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,947
I'd even been so discourteous to my Modryb...

107
00:06:58,947 --> 00:07:00,582
Please, forgive me, Modryb.

108
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:02,897
What's this apology for, Wali?

109
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,983
One gets discourteous in love and war...

110
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,562
Tea, or coffee?

111
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,706
Coffee today.

112
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:14,590
Just a moment.

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,510
Seriously, though, Wali,

114
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,166
You killed Babu Hamid for nothing.

115
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,802
The poor lad was a nice man.

116
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:25,240
She still cries in his memory.

117
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,136
Tell her not to, Modryb.

118
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,167
One doesn't cry for any other man.

119
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,498
Besides,

120
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:34,558
Murders happen in love and war.

121
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:40,379
Do you see how lively she is, Modryb?

122
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,660
I'll take you along tomorrow!

123
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,109
Tomorrow?

124
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,506
The day after, if not tomorrow.

125
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:50,042
As you say.

126
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,059
Now, I'd only do as you say, Modryb.

127
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:54,029
Then, take her today.

128
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:55,759
There will be no tomorrow.

129
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,920
Why, Modryb?

130
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,421
Do you fear anyone?
-Yes...

131
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:00,898
Afzal, you know...

132
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,380
He's fine now.

133
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,161
He's started walking.

134
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,942
So?

135
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,097
So what?

136
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:07,783
I'm afraid.

137
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,244
She was drawn to him in the beginning.

138
00:08:10,244 --> 00:08:12,665
What do you mean? She'd fallen in love?
-No.

139
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:14,285
Not love; just fondness.

140
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:19,021
Fondness, though, as in, fondness today, love tomorrow...

141
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:21,985
Easy there, don't worry.

142
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:23,886
Have your coffee.

143
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,336
Sit tight, Wali,

144
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,980
Or I'll fill you with lead.

145
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,170
Do you know how much thoughtful labour it takes to brew a cup of coffee?

146
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,900
The poor lass has put a lot of effort making it.

147
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,951
You'd have spilt it if you'd run away, wouldn't you?

148
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,536
Alright,

149
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,396
Drink it.

150
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:01,287
Drink it sip by sip.

151
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,030
I'll sit here and watch you enjoy it.

152
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,890
The two of you have conspired against me, haven't you?

153
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,279
You've handed me over to the enemy.

154
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,810
I've recovered you through them.

155
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,406
I didn't have time to waste looking for someone like you.

156
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,997
How could I do everything else if I'd kept looking for you, eh, bugger?

157
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:36,177
Why are you looking at the window?

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,797
Your four minions

159
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,963
Won't come to help you one bit.

160
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,738
Ask why.

161
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:46,249
Why?

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,816
The four of them are all dead.

163
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,700
Alright,

164
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,906
Have your coffee.

165
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,587
Here.

166
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,690
Peace be upon you.

167
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,006
And upon you, peace.

168
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,496
Now, before asking

169
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,043
How we are, quickly tell me

170
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:40,746
Where the blighter is!

171
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:44,487
I feel like exchanging blows with him first!

172
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:47,577
This way, isn't it?

173
00:10:47,577 --> 00:10:48,168
Yes.

174
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,897
Come.

175
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,957
Afzal!

176
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,927
Afzal!

177
00:11:05,897 --> 00:11:08,538
You blighter! You've been caught!

178
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:11,028
I'm here now!

179
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:15,110
I've brought your Mum and Arifa along!

180
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,942
Afzal!

181
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,506
Where is he?

182
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,631
Please, sit down and have some tea.

183
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,617
We'll talk.

184
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:38,596
There, now.

185
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:41,726
We haven't come here to talk, Monseigneur.

186
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,357
We've come here to meet him.

187
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:47,097
Please, allow us to meet him.

188
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:50,942
This meeting is not possible, Madame.

189
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,550
He's left.

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,141
Where's the keys?

191
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,196
In my pocket.

192
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:53,757
Take it out.

193
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,766
No, my dear --

194
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:37,010
I didn't ask for water...

195
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:39,797
Give it to her,

196
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:42,008
She's crying a lot.

197
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,026
Aunt, why don't you have this?

198
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:47,517
It'll ease you a bit.

199
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:49,788
No, my dear.

200
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,404
I've been eased.

201
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,735
I've shed a few tears when the moment came,

202
00:13:54,735 --> 00:13:57,885
I've shed a few tears when the moment came, so I've been eased, so to speak.

203
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,326
Why don't you have it, my dear?

204
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,526
You haven't even shed a single tear.

205
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,846
There!

206
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,781
She's been eased, too.

207
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,767
Get up, Reverend.

208
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,560
We should turn back and leave,

209
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,931
Or the night will be a long one.

210
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,761
How can that be, Madame?

211
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,046
If we have to go back, we'd leave together tomorrow morning.

212
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:59,286
We'd have to go back, Monseigneur.

213
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,970
He's gone,

214
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,369
And so are we, you could say.

215
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:14,260
Look, he didn't tell me anything before leaving.

216
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,021
It's possible that he'd come back.

217
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,050
That's something I like about you, Monseigneur,

218
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:27,937
You put a dying soul on a ventilator.

219
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:31,566
You never let one's hope die out.

220
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,661
He's left his things here.

221
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,372
That means he'd come back.

222
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:47,323
The guard told me that he said he's going to get a cigarette.

223
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:51,319
He's started smoking, too?

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,000
He'd smoke a few now and then there, too...

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,281
He doesn't have any such habit, really...

226
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,151
Would you happen to have sleeping pills?

227
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,370
No problem if you don't have any.

228
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,846
She'd stay awake

229
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:22,080
Even after taking one,

230
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,486
And when she stays awake,

231
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,996
She doesn't let me sleep.

232
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,741
Where are his things?

233
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,782
In that room.

234
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,931
Where are you off to, Ruqaiyya Begum?

235
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:08,473
The rapscallion leaves his scent behind even after he's left.

236
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,632
He's left us,

237
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:21,933
Let me see if he's given up that habit, too.

238
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,776
Afzal...

239
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,107
My Afzal...

240
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,496
I used to make aeroplanes like that in my younger days.

241
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:40,927
Tad would be delighted to see, and say in a lively voice, 'You'll see, Arifa',

242
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,103
'My son will become a pilot one day'.

243
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,700
Arifa?

244
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,030
Arifa was my Mam's name.

245
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,026
Hey!

246
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,276
My sister's name is Arifa!

247
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:53,970
Surely, your Mam's name isn't Ruqaiyya?

248
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,410
Yes!

249
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,437
My Mum's name is Ruqaiyya.

250
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,553
How do you know?

251
00:18:59,553 --> 00:19:02,964
Ruqaiyya was my younger sister's name.

252
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,337
So you'd kill me?

253
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,500
I don't want to kill you either.

254
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,967
It would pain my Dad a lot to hear

255
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:34,477
That a faithful one has killed another.

256
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,388
It'd pain me, too.

257
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:42,224
But, you bugger,

258
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:46,042
You took the life of a faithful man,

259
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:49,823
And killed another deep inside?

260
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,153
Forgive me.

261
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,163
That's it...

262
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,743
I've been thinking about that, too.

263
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,016
But how can I forgive you?

264
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,420
Alright.

265
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,930
Tell me something positive,

266
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,297
Hearing which

267
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:18,975
I could have mercy.

268
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,717
Afzal, I can be very useful.

269
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,947
I'm Najju's right hand man.

270
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:27,416
I've seen that you're made of the right stuff.

271
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,837
Come with me, I can introduce you to matey.

272
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,618
You can do his work

273
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:34,009
And earn millions.

274
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,311
What

275
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:38,080
Is this matey's name?

276
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,600
Najju.

277
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,526
He's committed 16 murders.

278
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,726
He marches about the city,

279
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:50,386
But the police don't dare raise an eye at Najju.

280
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:52,757
Call your 'matey'.
-Why just call?

281
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:53,928
Come with me,

282
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:56,748
I'll seat you right before him.

283
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,021
Call him.

284
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:01,612
A --

285
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:02,241
A -- Alright --

286
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,821
A -- Alright -- Phone...

287
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,816
Aye, matey, it's me, Wali.

288
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,326
Go on.

289
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,296
Why are you so scared?

290
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,997
No, matey --

291
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:28,810
I'm not scared --

292
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,779
I'm negotiating with Afzal.

293
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:33,609
I'm having a deal with him.

294
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:35,709
Who's Afzal?

295
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,611
That'd be me.

296
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,591
Afzal Subhanallah.

297
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,186
Who are you?

298
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,416
Just like there's a 'matey' backing every hoodlum,

299
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,336
Every 'matey' out there's got his oul fella.

300
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:55,087
I asked who <i>you</i> are.

301
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,598
I'm your oul fella, Najju.

302
00:21:57,598 --> 00:21:59,629
I've just gotten this post.

303
00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:01,110
Give the phone to Wali.

304
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,781
Wali, --
-Listen, Najju!

305
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,866
Talk to your oul fella.

306
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,311
Later on, you'd wish you better had.

307
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:16,051
Alright,

308
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:17,950
Make a deal with me.

309
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,547
What deal?

310
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,947
Give me a good mansion,

311
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:24,967
Two cars,

312
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,587
And 5 million.

313
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,507
It'll prolong your life.

314
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:31,517
Or else?

315
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,420
What'd you do?

316
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,006
It's simple, Najju,

317
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,396
I'd kill you.

318
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,430
You bleedin' --
-No, no...

319
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,917
Don't abuse me.

320
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:42,770
I won't take the money after such abuses.

321
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,966
I'd take your life.

322
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,130
We're done for now.

323
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,290
And when you offer prayers for Wali tomorrow, pause and think

324
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,991
Why no one's given the call to this prayer,

325
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:02,540
Because, Najju, matey,

326
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,001
Death doesn't knock before coming in.

327
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,576
So you'd kill me?

328
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:19,320
That's what I've been thinking about.

329
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,960
It's my first murder,

330
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,953
And that scares me.

331
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,986
Please.

332
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,377
Sit.

333
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,210
Everything's alright, isn't it, Monseigneur?

334
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes, everything's fine so far,

335
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,310
But if this night passes off fine,

336
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,170
You'll get good news in the morning.

337
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,370
So,

338
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,920
Why, then, are you worried, Monseigneur?

339
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Look,

340
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,900
I --

341
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:51,165
Normally have a lot of courage,

342
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:56,959
But, seeing you in this perplexed state,

343
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:59,190
My courage has begun to falter.

344
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,015
That is precisely why I'm talking to you in solitude.

345
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,041
If Madame

346
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,152
Heard it, she'd start wailing.

347
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,726
Wailing?

348
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,956
Look...

349
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,290
Your son...
-H --

350
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:22,501
He's alright, isn't he?

351
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,590
Yes, he's fine, but...

352
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,990
He'd taken two bullets to his leg a few days ago.

353
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,597
That was nothing serious, really,

354
00:25:33,597 --> 00:25:37,447
He was fine in a few days, but...

355
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:40,180
B -- b -- but?

356
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,656
The same people murdered his friend, Babu Hamid.

357
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:47,537
Just a few days ago.

358
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,650
You're listening, aren't you, Reverend?

359
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,481
Yes?

360
00:25:56,481 --> 00:25:59,587
He's gone looking for them,

361
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:04,033
Especially the lad who'd murdered Babu Hamid.

362
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,920
What'd he do

363
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,375
When he's found them?

364
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,409
You tell me what he'd do.

365
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,373
You know him better.

366
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,437
Ruqaiyya!

367
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,720
Ruqaiyya!

368
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,226
Ruqaiyya!

369
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:56,277
Come, Ruqaiyya Begum!

370
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,948
Pack your things.

371
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,446
'Tis the reckoning.

372
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,557
Afzal isn't coming back.

373
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,916
Afzal isn't coming back...

374
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,150
Afzal isn't coming back.
-Afzal!

375
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,826
He isn't coming back...

376
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:20,080
There's no turning back from where I stand now,

377
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,840
And you're going back

378
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,967
From where you've come.

379
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:28,392
Listen to me, Afzal,

380
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:32,163
5 million, 2 cars, a nice mansion -- I can give you.

381
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:34,328
Just spare me.

382
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,390
I won't even walk down Jasmine's alley again. If you see me, you can shoot me dead.

383
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,331
I won't even walk down Jasmine's alley again. If you see me, you can shoot me dead.
-I know you won't, Wali.

384
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:43,971
But what would I do?

385
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:49,666
How would I walk past the cemetery where there's a new grave of one Babu Hamid?

386
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,000
Isn't it a question

387
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,422
You don't have the answer to?

388
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,370
I've been seeing Babu Hamid in my dreams for four days without a break.

389
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:15,628
He says, 'You'd mocked the Lahoris, eh'?

390
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,209
'Tell me, now',

391
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:21,960
'Are Hyderabadis weaklings'?

392
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,030
You're unknown in this city.

393
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,380
Here dwell the kind that'd swallow you whole without opening their mouths!

394
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,770
Join hands with me,

395
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,777
And you'll see

396
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:38,947
Where I take you.

397
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:43,588
Your words enrage my friends.

398
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:45,877
Come here, Babloo.

399
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,154
Take his phone.

400
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,038
Najju's number is saved in it.

401
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:19,130
Forgive me, Wali,

402
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:25,580
But I can't remember Dad's words at this moment;

403
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,921
All I can see is Babu Hamid's face.

404
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,446
Give my regards to Babu Hamid.

405
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,736
I said call him here.

406
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:11,796
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

407
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,536
Strange.

408
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,670
He's fearing me

409
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,169
And I him...

410
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,030
Dad!

411
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,110
Forgive me for all my sins!

412
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,182
For God's sake, forgive me!

413
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,776
You blighter!

414
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,516
You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

415
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:48,370
And you'd leave those who love you

416
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,911
In Hyderabad?

417
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,056
Why didn't you wake me up?

418
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:22,666
No one needs any waking up in this house now, my dear.

419
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:26,786
I knew that you were awake.

420
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,207
She is, too.

421
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,278
Take care of her.

422
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,889
In the Lord's protection [Goodbye].

423
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:38,989
It's raining heavily outside.

424
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,650
Ah, yes --

425
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,530
I can see that.

426
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,606
What happened?

427
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:55,031
I've been slapped hard in the face.

428
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:58,980
I've been told not to go out.

429
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,424
Henceforth,

430
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:04,870
Someone else will lead the prayers.

431
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,910
Who's told you, Dad?

432
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,086
Who could it be except Him?

433
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:15,867
How would He accept, now,

434
00:34:15,867 --> 00:34:18,438
That a hoodlum's father

435
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:22,938
Should go about his priestly duties at the Mosque?

436
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:26,789
He's forcefully retired me.

437
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:31,110
Get up, Ruqaiyya Begum!

438
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,981
The prayer and time are both slipping from our hands.

439
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,776
You may leave.

440
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:16,666
I'll prepare it.

441
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,137
You get up at daybreak everyday.

442
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:30,987
I thought you'd pray today.

443
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,990
Visit Hyderabad for once.

444
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,971
It'll ease you if you meet Mum and Dad for once.

445
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:45,411
I can't go there.

446
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,861
Why can't you?

447
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,370
Dad would've thundered his judgement on me,

448
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,436
Proclaimed me a sinner and spat on me.

449
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:02,318
He doesn't pronounce judgements anymore.

450
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,720
He's stopped going

451
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,530
To the Mosque for the last one month.

452
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,666
He says, 'Priesthood is not proper for me'.

453
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,838
Who told you?

454
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:17,967
Eladio.

455
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,919
Where is he?

456
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:24,304
Sleeping.

457
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,383
He'd die in agony if he doesn't go to the Mosque.

458
00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:38,113
I know my virtuous Dad very well.

459
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:40,573
That's why I'm saying that you should go for once.

460
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,506
One look at the sinner's face would resurrect his righteousness.

461
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:46,907
He'd insult me,

462
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:50,042
He'd say, 'Don't you dare set your foot at my doorstep'!

463
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,357
Or, he'd say, 'Ruqaiyya',

464
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:53,386
'Stop him'.

465
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:57,712
'Do not let him desecrate any part of my house beyond the doorstep'.

466
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:02,208
When it's a matter of virtuousness and sin,

467
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,578
Mum always supports him.

468
00:37:05,578 --> 00:37:07,010
She'd say,

469
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:09,407
'Who are you, my good man'?

470
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,117
'Who do you want to meet'?

471
00:37:14,287 --> 00:37:16,808
It'd kill me to hear that, mate.

472
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:18,984
Then sleep through daybreak.

473
00:37:18,984 --> 00:37:22,021
Be done with this telepathy.

474
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,330
Every one of your family is awake at this hour.

475
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,027
Then, give me sleeping pills.

476
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,126
5 mg.

477
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,376
I'll sleep through daybreak.

478
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,417
Yes?

479
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,421
Who are you?

480
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,420
Who do you want to meet?

481
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,530
I'm Sajid, Samina.

482
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,320
So what if you're Sajid?

483
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,476
Who do you want to meet?

484
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,247
You're deliberately not recognising me, innit?

485
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,681
Your name sounds familiar, you look familiar.

486
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,272
Look,

487
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:46,193
An enemy of my husband's is named Sajid.

488
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,324
Please, leave

489
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:49,950
If you're the same.

490
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,936
Please, leave.

491
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,641
That makes you

492
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,216
My enemy as well.

493
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,460
<i>... And there are distances now,</i>

494
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,600
<i>Someone was close to me,</i>

495
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,630
<i>And there are distances now...</i>

496
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:31,696
<i>Destined for man</i>

497
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:35,770
<i>Is such helplessness...</i>

498
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,106
<i>So what,</i>

499
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:43,872
<i>If he has altered course,</i>

500
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,863
<i>I'd stay quiet</i>

501
00:39:46,863 --> 00:39:51,910
<i>Without aspersing and disgracing him...</i>

502
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:58,006
<i>How many are alive without their lov --</i>

503
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,630
The estate agent had come in the morning.

504
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,190
He said he's found a new tenant.

505
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,719
He'd pay 12,000 a month,

506
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,275
And he's willing to pay a year's advance.

507
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,417
I don't want the 12,000 a month or a year's advance.

508
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,232
What do you mean?

509
00:40:20,232 --> 00:40:22,480
No tenant will live in this house now.

510
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,157
The ones that came and left have been enough.

511
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,968
How would things go on?

512
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,163
The money saved up for my wedding

513
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:33,230
Are enough for four years.

514
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,996
Won't you get married?

515
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,900
Why wouldn't I?

516
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,646
As long as that blighter is a 'Bhai' [hoodlum, also brother], my marriage to him isn't possible.

517
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,500
He'd come to me

518
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,301
The day he's no longer one...

519
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:49,396
I wouldn't need so much money for the wedding then.

520
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
