1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,820
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,110
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,229
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:30,620
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,129
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,860
Doctor,

8
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,069
Her heart's fine, right?

9
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,450
What happened to her heart?

10
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,001
It's all about the heart, Doctor; who knows what you're checking...

11
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,727
I can check her pulse, too;

12
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,192
A high or low blood pressure is evident from the way she talks,

13
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,192
But

14
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:18,070
I cannot know about her heart.

15
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,960
She's come back

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,310
From Karachi, wounded.

17
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,191
Please check thoroughly, there must be something wrong.

18
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,320
No, Reverend, her heart's fine.

19
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,050
Strange...

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,984
So, that means that when one is tormented,

21
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:40,090
The other person should not think that one's heart is tormented.

22
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,430
Won't you prescribe any medicines?

23
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,008
If not for the heart,

24
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:50,388
Please give her one for the torment.

25
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,659
There's no need.

26
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,968
Give her a sleeping pill if she cannot sleep.

27
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,549
2 mg.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,880
Come, Doctor.

29
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,340
Wait, Reverend,

30
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,840
Let me write down the name of the pill.

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,230
No need for that.

32
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,501
I keep a packet of sleeping pills in my pocket all the time.

33
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,542
Speaking of which,

34
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:17,973
She won't even doze off for a minute with your 2 mg.

35
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,863
Alright, then.

36
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,034
That's it.
-Come.

37
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,394
Goodbye.

38
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,204
Goodbye, sir.

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,040
Come.

40
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,950
What do you feel?

41
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,460
I feel that he's not at home.

42
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,920
When the lass came yesterday,

43
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,330
It occurred to me that I should stop her,

44
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,390
Say that she should stay here,

45
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,455
And not go back.

46
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:14,020
She's nobody to me, so to speak,

47
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,880
But I feel that my Afzal's here when she comes.

48
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,170
Farah?

49
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:24,850
When you say Farah like that,

50
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,999
It sounds as if she used to write him letters.

51
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,704
Even if she did not,

52
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:39,930
For the love of the Lord, she could've written one to save the life of a mother.

53
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,425
Or, just ask her not to come here.

54
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:45,610
Tell her

55
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,210
To let the dead remain interred in their graves,

56
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,955
And not come again and again to offer her prayers.

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,080
She'd come to tell that she's getting married.

58
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,961
There, now.

59
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:05,612
Hearing that, it felt

60
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:09,221
As if she's doing something wrong.

61
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,089
As if she's turning back after giving us her word.

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,400
She's doing what's best.

63
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,820
She's doing what's best...

64
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,060
She's not doing what's best.

65
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,811
She was talking about him all the time.

66
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:40,176
She's in the same condition as you.

67
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:43,012
Her heart beats alright,

68
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:46,012
But grows restless.

69
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,140
No...

70
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,353
There's nothing to worry about, really.

71
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:24,026
Call whenever you want.

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
Whenever, as in,

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,071
Anytime.

74
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,653
No need to get so romantic.

75
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:51,094
I know very well

76
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:53,345
That no one truly loves these days,

77
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,590
And even when one does, one does not understand it.

78
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,050
Anyway, tell me, do you watch films?

79
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,980
Oh, no, I watch a lot!

80
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,275
Have you watched Chennai Express?

81
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,990
You shameless --

82
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,150
Yes...

83
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,461
I'd watched that scene, too,

84
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,821
But only secretly.

85
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:16,957
Farah was right by me, you know...

86
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,050
Whom are you chatting with?

87
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,451
Hey!

88
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,697
Is that even a question?

89
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:26,887
The same blighter?

90
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,370
Obviously.

91
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,430
Every girl's got just one blighter in her life.

92
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,580
I'll call you later --

93
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,370
We'll talk at night.

94
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,130
Not at all --

95
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,950
She didn't call you a blighter.

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,980
Okay,

97
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,384
Bye.

98
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,601
He heard it!

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,910
Have some shame, Lubna.

100
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,310
You're head over heels for a killer?

101
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,640
You'll see, if he gets caught,

102
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,360
The police will be here too!

103
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,040
Why would they be here?

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,490
They'd be pleased to interrogate his beloved for a few days, too!

105
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,440
Don't tell me!

106
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,839
Anyway, though,

107
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,730
What does love care about problems?

108
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,500
Have you seen Dad?

109
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,101
He's not mentioned him once since we came back from Karachi.

110
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:18,051
Right...

111
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:19,722
I've noticed it too.

112
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:21,893
Why are you calling him, then?

113
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:24,503
By the Lord, I'm not!

114
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:26,722
He calls me again and again.

115
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:27,923
Change your number

116
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,872
Just like he had.

117
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:30,758
But --

118
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:31,833
But what?

119
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,819
Would you settle only when Dad's been disgraced?

120
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Just think you made a mistake.

121
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,410
Ask forgiveness of God,

122
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,570
And get married and go to your home

123
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,220
As soon as your next semester's finished.

124
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,551
Who'd I marry?

125
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:49,321
Oh, please!

126
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,062
As if all the other psychiatrists in Hyderabad have died!

127
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:54,233
So I should marry a psychiatrist, too?

128
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,171
Put a sock in it!

129
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:57,493
As if I'm mad!

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,630
So all of you think <i>I</i>'m mad?

131
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,140
Honestly, Lubna,

132
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,614
Why did Dad decide to get me married to that psychiatrist?

133
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,700
He's taken a liking to you.

134
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,580
He's lost his heart to you.

135
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,745
He pleaded before Dad,

136
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:17,495
And Dad thought he's a fine man,

137
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,250
And the most famous doctor in all of Hyderabad.

138
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,830
Don't call him a doctor!

139
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,500
The blighter's a psychiatrist.

140
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,980
Don't call him a blighter either,

141
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,399
It'd sink into his heart.

142
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,092
So what if it does?

143
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,793
Good Lord,

144
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:33,457
One doesn't insult one's would-be husband before marriage.

145
00:09:33,457 --> 00:09:36,474
Otherwise, they exact their revenge.

146
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,110
I can't marry him.

147
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,450
What?

148
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,051
What <i>now</i>?

149
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,680
But --

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,949
You just said 'yes' the other day!

151
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:47,476
For God's sake, Farah,

152
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:49,740
Dad's blood pressure would shoot up!

153
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,010
Lubna, look,

154
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,350
Please don't mind what I'm saying,

155
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,810
But the thing is

156
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,896
I can't marry anyone now.

157
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,311
I feel as if

158
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:00,817
My heart would fail

159
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,998
The moment the wedding procession would come for me.

160
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,000
Then discuss it with him.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,010
Then discuss it with him.
-Who?

162
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,130
Your psychiatrist, of course!

163
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,661
He'd have a hundred cures.

164
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,802
Besides, he knows very well <i>who</i> he's marrying.

165
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:17,542
He'd have gone through all his books again.

166
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,577
Nobody can cure me.

167
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:23,566
I know I'm not alright,

168
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:25,333
But the bigger thing is

169
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,030
That I don't want to be cured in the first place.

170
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,872
Do you have his number?

171
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,664
Yes...

172
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,340
Call and ask him

173
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,560
To stay away from me,

174
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,790
Or I will murder him!

175
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,100
I don't love him,

176
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,630
But it feels like I'm in love.

177
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,901
Well, it isn't anything spectacular...

178
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:14,161
There's a great difference between feeling and being in love.

179
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,085
What's the difference?

180
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,533
I feel so today,

181
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,551
But you'll see,

182
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:21,131
I may not tomorrow.

183
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,252
My heart will change one day

184
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:28,121
Just like he's changed his phone number.

185
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,700
You would've seen it in Karachi -

186
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,060
The clouds engulf the skies,

187
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,740
But it doesn't rain.

188
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,163
The same has happened with me -

189
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,146
Clouds enveloped the skies,

190
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:47,690
But brought no rain.

191
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,880
But brought no rain.
<i>Every compeer abandoned me...</i>

192
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,790
<i>Every compeer abandoned me...</i>

193
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,970
You could get his number.

194
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,130
Sajid would have it.

195
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,170
Who's Sajid?

196
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,310
His friend.

197
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,280
An old one.

198
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,700
And how would we get Sajid's number?

199
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,261
I have it with me.

200
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:16,402
Just ask him

201
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,295
To let you talk to Afzal,

202
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,140
Or give his number.

203
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,164
Why would he let me talk to him?

204
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,839
He'd ask, 'Who are you'? 'What do you want with him'?

205
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,389
Just say you're a friend of Samina's.

206
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:30,299
He won't ask anything then.

207
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,140
I'll take my leave.

208
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,336
Give me his number.

209
00:12:38,336 --> 00:12:39,646
Right...

210
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,877
Look it up.

211
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,860
If you look up 'Hyderabad',

212
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,561
You'd see his number.

213
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,320
Hello?

214
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,519
It's Sajid, innit?

215
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,920
Yes; who are you?

216
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,379
Samina.

217
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:24,371
S --

218
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,710
I think it's a girl.

219
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,430
Didn't his 'S --' tell you?

220
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,689
It's Samina.

221
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:38,794
No.

222
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:41,775
Samina would never call him.

223
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,160
Come again, who are you?

224
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,480
Oh --

225
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,770
It's Samina.

226
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,010
Didn't you recognise me?

227
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,549
In the last two years,

228
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:01,180
I've recognised Samina's voice better than her.

229
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,599
So, who are you?

230
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm her friend, Jasmine.

231
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,710
And I've gotten this number because I need something.

232
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,270
What do you need?

233
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,920
Give me Afzal's number.

234
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,920
I'd have to ask Afzal about that.

235
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,028
Do you ask for Afzal's permission to eat?

236
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,499
What?

237
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:22,749
You love Samina, don't you?

238
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:26,360
The two of you couldn't get married, innit?

239
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,380
Yes...

240
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,053
It's good that you weren't!

241
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:33,914
If the lad's not manly, he should remain single like you!

242
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,011
Note down his number.

243
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,044
Go on.

244
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,990
Thank you.

245
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,929
Good morning.

246
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:02,859
Good morning.

247
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,420
Please, come in.

248
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,800
Take these flowers.

249
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,956
Give the flowers to her.

250
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,330
You've got two hours.

251
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,910
Once Mum and Dad get back, you won't be able to talk.

252
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,561
Where is she?

253
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:16,590
She's mostly in her room.

254
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,949
She comes out once in a while if she's delighted.

255
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:20,030
Is she ever delighted?

256
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,721
What are you talking about?

257
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:25,722
She was a right lively lass - rollicking about everywhere!

258
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:29,398
Patients like her are right lively in the beginning - 'Rollicking about everywhere'.

259
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:31,012
They then turn all quiet, then.

260
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:33,312
What kind of patients?

261
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:35,893
You won't get it.

262
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,479
Those who fall in love become patients requiring constant and thorough attention.

263
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,260
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,090
You're calling those who love 'patients'?

265
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,990
I said you won't get it.

266
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,070
But I'm honest.

267
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,480
It's the world's one truly immedicable affliction...
-Love?

268
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,599
Yes.

269
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:58,200
And what a pleasant stroke of serendipity

270
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,860
Is it

271
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,450
That people are overjoyed to fall in love.

272
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,013
Just think about one's mental condition!

273
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,044
As if one's afflicted with cancer,

274
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:10,435
And he's calling his friends, telling them,

275
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,295
'Buddy, you know',

276
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,706
'I'm in cancer'.

277
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,357
Shut up, Mr Sibtain!

278
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:18,838
Don't say such things before her!

279
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:21,688
Please, call her.

280
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:24,659
I don't usually see patients on Sundays.

281
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,252
Get yourself treated,

282
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,483
Or a certain party might beat you with shoes.

283
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:29,908
Party?

284
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:30,652
Yes.

285
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:33,188
Those who love are a certain kind of party,

286
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:36,663
And the party of the heartbroken is the most dangerous.

287
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,042
If you said such things before them,

288
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,923
They'd beat you black and blue until your brain's french-fried!

289
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:44,270
So, when your sister's cured,

290
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,020
You'll realise that I fix the brains of those in love.

291
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,094
Hey!

292
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,190
When you said that you've fallen in love,

293
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,050
Were you lying then?

294
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,780
How did you figure I'm lying?

295
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,020
How could you be in love,

296
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,220
When you're saying so much against it?

297
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,180
Ever heard of the bird flu?

298
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,341
Or the Congo Virus?

299
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:10,861
That wretched Congo Virus killed many doctors who went to treat it!

300
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:13,202
Can't you talk in simpler terms?

301
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:14,920
The simple point is simply

302
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,559
That if the doctor can catch the Congo Virus,

303
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,340
Then, the doctor who goes in to cure it

304
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,929
Can catch love from the patient, too.

305
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,980
Doctors have feelings too.

306
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,900
A doctor's not made of stone.

307
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,440
He has feelings and emotions, too.

308
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,830
And then, everyone 'round here's eager to die.

309
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,020
I can't handle it.

310
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,519
Okay...

311
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,540
I'll call her here.

312
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,975
I'm coming...

313
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,135
Peace be upon you!

314
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:01,530
And upon you, peace.
-Come, please come, Mr Paracha...

315
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,900
And upon you, peace.
-Please, come in.

316
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,240
Peace be upon you.
-How are you, sir?

317
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,131
I'd known it, Mr Paracha,

318
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:15,657
That you'd remember me again in just a few days,

319
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:19,192
But I have humbly pleaded with you,

320
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:22,572
And begged forgiveness, too,

321
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:25,142
That I like the courage now

322
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:27,592
To stand

323
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:31,262
At the Prophet's tribune.

324
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:33,772
No, Reverend --

325
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,490
It's not about the Mosque or the tribune,

326
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,315
But I've come to you

327
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,860
With a problem.

328
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,150
Yes?

329
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,950
Problem?

330
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,176
Just give me your orders,

331
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:52,527
And it would be my fortune if I could be of any help.

332
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:53,577
Right...

333
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,818
Thank you very much...

334
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:58,330
Firstly, congratulations to you.

335
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,700
In fact, congratulations from all of us.

336
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,040
Sir?

337
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,030
What for?
-Oh, Reverend!

338
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,220
Afzal has, with the Lord's grace, conquered Karachi in a blink, so to speak.

339
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,390
His name resounds throughout.

340
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,990
And he's put the mightiest hoodlums in their place!

341
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,750
Mr Paracha,

342
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,790
Talk about your problem.

343
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,645
Reverend...

344
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,266
It's nothing much, really,

345
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,867
But the thing is --

346
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,368
Your nephews Haroon and Mamoon

347
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:36,961
Had started selling books about saving lives.

348
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,380
Yes...

349
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,090
And

350
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,320
Some blackguard sent them a slip demanding 200,000 Rupees.

351
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
I've got the slip...

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,845
Right here.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,731
I --

354
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,450
What'd I do with it?

355
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,169
Reverend,

356
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:02,155
Please give this slip to Afzal,

357
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:04,676
And tell him to give that blackguard a scolding.

358
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:08,546
That's all it'd take, Reverend!

359
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:12,676
Keep this slip in your pocket, Mr Paracha.

360
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:17,270
You say his mere scolding is enough,

361
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,020
And I say

362
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,780
That even dying of disgrace won't be enough for me.

363
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,450
Sir?

364
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,453
I regret to say that you're the first person in the entire neighbourhood

365
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:37,654
Whom I'm telling with utmost sorrow

366
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,850
That I've decided

367
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,909
To disown Afzal.

368
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:52,039
I am henceforth not responsible for any word or deed of his.

369
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,770
If the Lord so wills,

370
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:57,320
One of these days, this news will be printed in the newspapers, too,

371
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,954
Which will serve as a testimonial for all of you.

372
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,816
Why are you standing here?

373
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:07,460
Please, come in; have some tea, perhaps?

374
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,234
No, Reverend.

375
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,680
Thank you very much.

376
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,749
I'll take my leave.

377
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,590
Alright.

378
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,841
In the Lord's protection.

379
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,825
Here.

380
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,299
Listen to another one, Ruqaiyya Begum!

381
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,160
Our

382
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,010
Lives are ebbing away out of grief,

383
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,539
And people are coming here to congratulate us.

384
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,100
It was Mr Paracha.

385
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,680
He was talking to me

386
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,991
With such visible fear as if

387
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:09,062
He's talking to the Law Minister's Dad.

388
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,750
He handed me a slip for a tithe, saying,

389
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,760
'Give this to Afzal <i>Bhai</i>'.

390
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,620
Someone's demanded 200,000 from his wastrels of sons.

391
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,261
Now your habile lad's PA

392
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:30,890
Is going to

393
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,145
Call the cove,

394
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,716
And he'll be saying back, 'I'm sorry',

395
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,426
'Afzal Bhai, but I didn't know'

396
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:43,065
'That Haroon and Mamoon were your servitors'.

397
00:23:43,065 --> 00:23:47,847
Haroon and Mamoon are Mr Paracha's wastrels of sons.

398
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,090
May I ask something, Reverend?

399
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,010
Why,

400
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,041
Sure!

401
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,982
Ask me ten if you want.

402
00:23:56,862 --> 00:23:59,533
Don't you feel afraid?

403
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:04,111
If you run a bulletin of exaggerated news stories like a TV channel,

404
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:08,011
Won't it strike fear in my heart?

405
00:24:10,702 --> 00:24:14,730
And when one's heart is fearstricken, Reverend,

406
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,469
Doctors' visits and medicines don't help.

407
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:24,019
You always look for negative meanings to positive things.

408
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:26,035
Our son

409
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:31,525
Has sprouted wings and touched the fastigium of prosperity!

410
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,420
And you're sitting here like a cowardly mother, wailing,

411
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,010
'Watch out', 'Beware',

412
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,850
'He may slip and fall'.

413
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,680
Someone's congratulated us!

414
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,760
Say it jovially,

415
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,960
'Blessed be he'.

416
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,701
Did you say it?

417
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:52,752
'Blessed be he'?

418
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,713
Say it, will you, Reverend!

419
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,110
Our son's sprouted wings and touched the fastigium of prosperity,

420
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,640
And you're watching from the bottom like the austere yet inspiriting father,

421
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,571
That his ladder's standing on thin air.

422
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:20,820
I've always held fast to the ladder.

423
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,380
I can't even say,

424
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,199
'Watch out', 'Be careful'...

425
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:33,172
The abyss lies ahead and it's a long way down behind.

426
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,837
Alas...

427
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,310
A mother's no soldier, Dad,

428
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,110
Whose resolve would strengthen with every blow.

429
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,376
One of them may prove fatal, too.

430
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:04,117
Then tell her not to live half-dead.

431
00:26:04,117 --> 00:26:06,040
Show me her strength,

432
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,260
Or I will keep at it!

433
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,210
She's --

434
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,820
Lying on the bed all the time.

435
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,179
It kills me to see that...

436
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:27,991
I don't stop her from weeping and tormenting,

437
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:31,131
But is this even a way?

438
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:35,271
Tell her to get up and move about here.

439
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:40,431
If nothing else, she could at least pick a fight with me!

440
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:42,750
Arifa!

441
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,210
Yes, Mum?

442
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,590
Yes, Mum?

443
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,080
Why does the sound of my voice frighten you like that?

444
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,950
Call her.

445
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,770
Who?

446
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,585
The one who comes here when she's tormented, but never bothers

447
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:07,156
When I'm tormented.

448
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,756
Farah?

449
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,800
Farah's the one...

450
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,981
The one who wrote the letters,

451
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,977
And the one who does not.

452
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,210
Call her here.

453
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,030
Tell her there's neither the tiger in the fields, nor the hunter on the tree stand;

454
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,078
She can come now.

455
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,152
So pleasantly will time pass when two so crazed shall meet...

456
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:36,782
No...

457
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,550
What's there to 'no' about?

458
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:42,925
It benefits both of us when she comes.

459
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,996
I'd bless her,

460
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,767
And she'd heal me.

461
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:52,387
Just the sound of her voice

462
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:54,838
Eases my heart.

463
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,891
Why do you think that a psychiatrist can't fall in love?

464
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,981
Remember, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

465
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,562
Every lover is a psychiatrist.

466
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,990
He plays both the patient and the healer.

467
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,650
Remember, also, that no one can understand your state of mind better than me.

468
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,720
Why have you come here without Mum and Dad's permission?

469
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,390
I'll answer that at the end of our little conversation.

470
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,561
For now,

471
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,836
Just look deeply into my eyes.

472
00:28:34,836 --> 00:28:37,217
What do I look for in there?

473
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,130
Hey!

474
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,089
Do you think I'm so shameless?

475
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,350
Strange...

476
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,221
You're terming treatment as shamelessness!

477
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:48,942
<i>Treatment?</i>

478
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,751
So you've come here to treat me?

479
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:52,531
Lubna!

480
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,920
Why are you calling Lubna?

481
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,620
It was a slip of the tongue!

482
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,119
And --

483
00:28:56,119 --> 00:29:00,830
I'm always talking about treatment -- So I called this meeting a treatment...

484
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,701
By the way, you could've thought that I'm giving a signal of sorts.

485
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,979
What kind of signal?

486
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:15,630
Say, we call a meeting 'treatment'.

487
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,930
Let's have codes for going for a ride and going to the pictures, too, shall we?

488
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,620
Exempli gratia, the signal for going to the pictures could be 'operation'...

489
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,670
So, say

490
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,270
You get a text at 6 p.m.

491
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,380
'Operation'.

492
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,840
Take it that I've got two film tickets in my pocket.

493
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,310
You're a proper blighter, I give you that!

494
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,660
No problem.

495
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,620
What 'no problem'?

496
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,710
As I'd told you the other day, it happens in my profession.

497
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,950
People even insult my mother and sister. I don't mind it.

498
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,623
I'd better leave!
-Don't you dare!

499
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:49,831
What'd you just say?

500
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:52,901
I said 'Don't you dare'! Sit.

501
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,058
Sit!

502
00:29:55,058 --> 00:29:57,129
Sit tight here and listen to me.

503
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,029
Don't get up.

504
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:02,053
I'd like to

505
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,863
Talk to you about Afzal.

506
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,940
What about him?

507
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,220
He's no longer the kind of malady a psychiatrist can treat.

508
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,880
He's become an ace 'Bhai' [hoodlum, lit. brother].
-So what?

509
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,630
I've treated many such 'Bhais' who've now become oul fellas.

510
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,631
Ever heard of 'The Ghost' Jessie?

511
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:30,782
He was an infamous racketeer of Hyderabad.

512
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:32,822
Came to me for his treatment.

513
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,403
I jesse'd him on the first day.

514
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:37,753
I thought I'd start with fixing the nyaff's gender.

515
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,403
Know what, he got married right after getting cured. By the Lord's grace, he's got two young'uns now.

516
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:44,274
He sells leatherware near the police station.

517
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:45,581
I saw him the other day,

518
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:50,910
And he said, 'I can get you a jess or a Jessy Made made-to-order, Doc'!

519
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,970
But why are we talking about 'The Ghost' Jessie?

520
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,609
Because you wanted to talk about Afzal.

521
00:30:56,609 --> 00:30:58,319
The poor soul...

522
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,700
I've heard he was a nice and upright lad.

523
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,420
He'd even quit gambling and started praying.

524
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,780
But who knows

525
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,955
Why he left Hyderabad for Karachi...

526
00:31:08,545 --> 00:31:10,340
Because of me.

527
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:12,190
I think

528
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,530
He left because of me.

529
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,291
I'd told you this one, too!

530
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,131
What does it matter if you'd told?

531
00:31:19,131 --> 00:31:21,592
You tell me anything and everything that you can utter.

532
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:24,740
But you keep your heart's secrets locked deep in your heart.

533
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,350
He'd have fallen in love...

534
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,180
I'd told you about that, too.

535
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,740
Another girl named Farah used to write him letters.

536
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,879
He loved just her.

537
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:35,630
Who knows how many he loves now...

538
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:38,900
<i>That</i>'s the problem with you.

539
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,283
What's my problem?

540
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:44,083
What's the problem with me?

541
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,674
No, not yours -- it's his problem...

542
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:50,205
The thing is, if he'd just mustered the courage to say it once,

543
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:52,676
'To the dickens with the Farah who writes letters',

544
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,977
'I love you',

545
00:31:54,977 --> 00:31:57,520
He wouldn't have had to see this time in Karachi today.

546
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,820
What?

547
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,975
As if the blighter had so much courage as to come to me and say, 'I love you'?

548
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,920
Wouldn't I have broken his face?

549
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
I'm sure you would have;

550
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,061
Aye, you'd be busy mending it afterwards.

551
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,664
And to be honest,

552
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,585
You did break his face, which made him leave,

553
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:19,955
And you're busy putting it together.

554
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,060
But you don't know, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

555
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,600
They say a gentleman's face, when broken, can be mended,

556
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,340
But a mended head cannot be held high.

557
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,910
See you.

558
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,980
Yes, Arifa,

559
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,260
Tell me,

560
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,520
Is everything alright?

561
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,482
We need your help.

562
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,250
Please, tell me.

563
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,410
What do you need?

564
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,210
We need you, Farah...

565
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:35,860
Mum's found a cure for her condition,

566
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,610
And she's come up with your name as a home remedy.

567
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,170
I don't get it...

568
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,745
How do I explain it to you...

569
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,720
Mum needs Afzal to live.

570
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,545
But he can't come now.

571
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,755
When you come, Mum feels

572
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:57,036
As if Afzal's here.

573
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,980
Hey!

574
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,020
Shouldn't you be in Clifton?

575
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,781
I should be at home.

576
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:33,291
The new chef asked for my help to cook.

577
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,200
New chef?

578
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,430
What happened to the old one?

579
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:40,541
He'd just serve the plates.

580
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,728
What's this guff, mate?

581
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:48,156
How could you hire any Tom, Dick, or Harry as a new chef without asking me?

582
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:50,279
This isn't Hyderabad, Sajid,

583
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,219
It's Karachi.

584
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,856
Sit.

585
00:35:29,856 --> 00:35:31,761
Sit down here.

586
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,830
Here.

587
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,870
Look at these.

588
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,246
Don't look at me; look at these photographs.

589
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:56,186
Go through each of these and ask me who they are.

590
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,454
Who are they?

591
00:36:00,907 --> 00:36:04,607
I've murdered them one by one.

592
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:16,510
This game of murdering and killing is so fierce that it doesn't end until the killer is dead!

593
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,619
There's opulence to be seen,

594
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,330
I live in this mansion like an Emperor,

595
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:30,210
And the police salute me like my humble subjects when I go out,

596
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,040
I've got millions of Rupees,

597
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,960
But not a moment's assurance that I can live in peace.

598
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,074
You're a very sweet and delicate girl,

599
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:48,015
And your dreams are even more delicate than you.

600
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:53,276
But I'm the kind who'd shatter glass utensils at the slightest provocation,

601
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:56,625
Whatever could I do with your dreams?

602
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:00,147
What's the real story?

603
00:37:00,147 --> 00:37:01,917
I just told you.

604
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,357
No.

605
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:05,952
The real story is that you don't like me.

606
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:07,379
From our starting quarrels,

607
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:10,078
You thought that Jasmine's very insolent.

608
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:13,318
Although I'm not insolent at all.

609
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,959
Do you love me?

610
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,290
When did I say that?

611
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,605
I thought that <i>you</i> love me but are just a bit afraid to tell me.

612
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:30,600
Don't be afraid.

613
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,052
There's quite a bit of frankness between the two of us, now.

614
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,625
Just say it.

615
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:42,550
Why are you so afraid, boyo?

616
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,819
What's the worst that can happen?

617
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,850
I'd scold you.

618
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,012
It's late in the evening.

619
00:37:50,012 --> 00:37:52,370
This is the perfect time for these things.

620
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,941
Such things sound bland in broad daylight.

621
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,446
Get in the car.

622
00:37:57,446 --> 00:37:59,597
Taking me for a ride, eh?

623
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:01,758
I'm dropping you home.

624
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:02,868
Why?

625
00:38:02,868 --> 00:38:03,884
Do you have a problem?

626
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:05,569
What'd your Mum be thinking?

627
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:07,347
She trusts you completely.

628
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:08,914
I wasn't even coming here,

629
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:12,480
But she insisted that I go and see what you've been up to.

630
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,911
So, have you found out what I've been up to?
-Don't change the topic.

631
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:19,632
When the thing about love does come up, you say just half of it, and hold the rest of it back.

632
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,963
Finish the line, and you can drop me home after that if you like.

633
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:33,440
You don't know, Jasmine, you're a very good girl, but --
-Now, you'd better not say that you like me!

634
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,019
Your grammar fails at the most crucial moment.

635
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:38,609
Are you feeling shy now?

636
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,640
Alright, I'll look the other way.

637
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,929
There.

638
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:46,469
Now, say the full thing, and don't fumble with your grammar.

639
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,604
I don't love you, Jasmine...

640
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,789
And I'm not worthy of being loved, now, either.

641
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,170
Drop me at my place.

642
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
