1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,865
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:19,089
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:24,215
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:30,615
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:36,155
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:40,605
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,546
Please, have a cup of tea one last time.

8
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:15,667
One last time?

9
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,998
Who knows whether you'd ever come again...

10
00:02:17,998 --> 00:02:20,194
I'd happily serve you if you come again.

11
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:21,342
But today,

12
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:24,392
It'll be the last time from my side.

13
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,813
I'd said

14
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:33,580
That I've become the type who'd shatter glass utensils at the slightest provocation, hadn't I?

15
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,856
But you hadn't said that you shatter hearts.

16
00:02:39,856 --> 00:02:42,970
But what good is it, now that it's been broken...

17
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,166
Glass utensils

18
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,928
If not a heart...

19
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,880
Are you coming or leaving?

20
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,350
I'd leave after having tea.

21
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,762
I'm sure you would have;

22
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:36,682
Aye, you'd be busy mending it afterwards.

23
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,962
And to be honest,

24
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,935
You did break his face, which made him leave,

25
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,875
And you're busy putting it together.

26
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:49,336
But you don't know, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

27
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:52,917
They say a gentleman's face, when broken, can be mended,

28
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:56,407
But a mended head cannot be held high.

29
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:03,557
I know what you're thinking.

30
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,346
Aye, you'd know it very well.

31
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:12,582
I'm thinking about that blighter Sibtain.

32
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,347
No.

33
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,327
You're thinking why you broke Afzal's face in the first place,

34
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,350
And even if you had,

35
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,996
You shouldn't have shattered his honour.

36
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,991
So he tells you everything?

37
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:35,049
Who?

38
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,982
The blighter Sibtain, of course!

39
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,086
No.

40
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:40,736
These psychiatrists are very professional.

41
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:44,581
They don't share what their patients say with anyone else.

42
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,351
Give me his number.

43
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,002
Leave it be, will you, Farah.

44
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:49,782
It doesn't look proper.

45
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,989
What'd Dad think if you met him twice in one day?

46
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,830
Who told you I'm calling him to meet him?

47
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,346
Then?

48
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,386
Oh...

49
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,956
You feel like having a chat?

50
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:02,957
Aww...

51
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,127
That's so sweet.

52
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,162
Alright,

53
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:10,056
Here.

54
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:11,991
Use my phone.

55
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,029
Yes, Lubna?

56
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:27,517
Monsieur 'Lubna',

57
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,266
It's Farah!

58
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,710
Hold on -- Wait.

59
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,965
I'm coming!

60
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,625
Where are you coming?

61
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,246
I don't think you're well -- You just called me 'Monsieur Lubna'.

62
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,763
This is a case of complete memory loss.

63
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:41,620
If you set foot in this house again,

64
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,316
I'd break your legs!

65
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,386
Listen,

66
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,350
I have to say this is very insulting,

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,364
But --

68
00:05:49,364 --> 00:05:54,236
It happens in my profession, so --
-To the dickens with your profession!

69
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:55,431
If you dropped in here again,

70
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,798
I'll make sure you drop dead!

71
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,289
Never forget,

72
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,059
My name's Farah Ibrahim.

73
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,160
I'll hurl such insults that - forget about you -

74
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,741
Nobody in your profession would ever have heard!

75
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,770
Are there six of them?

76
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,541
No.

77
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,856
There's 4 gunmen with him.

78
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,786
They guard him.

79
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,658
Call him downstairs.

80
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,441
Why did you have him wait upstairs?

81
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,370
I've seen it in the movies

82
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,760
That one is taken to old places he's forgotten

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,287
When his memory gets lost.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,506
I'm trying the same.

85
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,719
I'm not talking about fleeing,

86
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:24,887
But about fighting.

87
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:27,978
Don't think of doing anything stupid; you have little time,

88
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:28,773
Get up.

89
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:30,769
And leave this place. Get up.

90
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:32,528
I'll flee on one condition.

91
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:34,094
Go on.

92
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,492
Quickly.

93
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:38,897
If I run away,

94
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:41,168
You'd fight them.

95
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,329
Done.

96
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,110
Go,

97
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,197
I'll fight them.

98
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,000
Why have you come to Karachi?

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,212
Looking for a job?

100
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,436
To become a great man.

101
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:06,157
So are you a twopenny-halfpenny man?

102
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,960
Nowhere will you find a great man if he's not inside you.

103
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,146
I've given your gunmen their tea.

104
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:31,027
This is for you.

105
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:32,717
Thank you.

106
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:33,903
No...

107
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:36,093
I should be thanking you.

108
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:37,898
You agreed to what I said,

109
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,588
And agreed to have a cup of tea.

110
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:41,297
Thank you.

111
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,098
Please, drink.

112
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,799
Look around - Does it look like you've left this room?

113
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,276
I clean it everyday,

114
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:02,972
And keep everything just like the two of you used to.

115
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,112
Surely, you must remember it sometimes?

116
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,066
Rem --

117
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,529
Remember what sometimes?

118
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,267
This room,

119
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,908
Babu Hamid,

120
00:09:15,908 --> 00:09:17,827
Of course...

121
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,252
And you've forgotten to collect your dues of 2,100 Rupees.

122
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,980
You didn't eat anything in the last 7 days of the month.

123
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,966
Collect your dues when you leave.

124
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:33,980
No --

125
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,771
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:38,182
I'm talking about the dues.

127
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:42,419
When you've paid all of yours, why don't you let me pay mine?

128
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,789
You forgot your bag here.

129
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,570
I had a look the other day.

130
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,622
I found a photo of your Mam and Tad,

131
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:57,237
A picture of Arifa,

132
00:09:57,237 --> 00:10:00,067
And an old mobile.

133
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,897
Don't worry.

134
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:04,907
I just saw the mobile.

135
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:07,736
I didn't see anything on it.

136
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:11,237
But

137
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,080
I saw the picture of your Mam and Tad,

138
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,310
And locked Arifa's face firmly in my memory.

139
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,766
I'd recognise her immediately if I ever meet her.

140
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,300
You'd recognise me too if you met me again, won't you?

141
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,706
I mean,

142
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:35,437
It's possible that we may never meet again...

143
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:38,687
Or that we meet after years...

144
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,024
Promise me, then,

145
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:47,904
If our paths crossed again, you won't say, 'I've seen you somewhere'.

146
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,667
Do you know

147
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,602
That a second heartbreak

148
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:57,476
Is just as bad as a second heart attack?

149
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:01,636
I have many precious memories with you, Jasmine;

150
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:04,267
I can never forget you.

151
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:06,063
I know that too.

152
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:09,974
Jasmine isn't the type that could be forgotten.

153
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:13,324
But why would you remember me?

154
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:16,763
And if anyone ever saw you remembering, what would you say?

155
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,826
Whatever was Jasmine to you?

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,811
Tell them, 'She was my landlady'.

157
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,906
No.

158
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,943
I'd say, 'I liked Jasmine'.

159
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,499
You'd recognise me too if you met me again, won't you?

160
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,111
I mean,

161
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:42,250
It's possible that we may never meet again...

162
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,651
Or that we meet after years...

163
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,856
Promise me, then,

164
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:54,437
If our paths crossed again, you won't say, 'I've seen you somewhere'.

165
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:56,377
Do you know

166
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,320
That a second heartbreak

167
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,346
Is just as bad as a second heart attack?

168
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,150
You'd vowed at the shrine, hadn't you,

169
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,380
That you'd come everyday for 7 days?

170
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,420
Won't you go today?

171
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,656
Why should I go now, when just one day has done the trick?

172
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:31,740
He said as he left,

173
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,101
'Jasmine, I like you'.

174
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,347
That's it.

175
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,978
My wish has been fulfilled.

176
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,696
Peace be upon you.

177
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,827
And upon you, peace.

178
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,906
Congratulations.

179
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,010
What for?

180
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,620
Sibtain's parents

181
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,616
Are landing in Karachi today.

182
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,557
I hear they'll be here tomorrow.

183
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,543
Here, as in, at our place.

184
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,587
Have your breakfast.

185
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,747
His Dad's a right jolly fellow.

186
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:37,494
He'd praise the English at length,

187
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,816
And finish with a grand insult.

188
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:42,967
But I felt pity at one thing...

189
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:47,348
He said, 'You can get anything in Yorkshire, except even half-decent dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice]'.

190
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:49,200
You could've said,

191
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,063
'Our Farah cooks excellent dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice]'.

192
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:52,927
Hey --

193
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,674
But I don't know --

194
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:58,700
Don't worry, I'll teach you everything before your marriage.

195
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,292
Excuse me.

196
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,923
Won't you have breakfast?

197
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,543
I've had my breakfast.

198
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:05,368
You haven't even had tea.

199
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,544
I'd have tea at Afzal's place.

200
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,607
Afzal -- I mean --

201
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:16,096
Arifa...

202
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,637
She'd called.

203
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:21,072
She said her Mum's missing me a lot.

204
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:23,210
May I go?

205
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,366
You'd gone the day before yesterday, too,

206
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:28,410
And you'd told me after getting there that you're at Afzal's place.

207
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,227
Why, sure, go if she's called you.

208
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:31,947
Give her my regards.

209
00:15:31,947 --> 00:15:34,378
Ask how everyone is.

210
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:37,128
May I go, too?

211
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,562
What'd you do there?

212
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:43,043
What'd <i>you</i> do there?

213
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,260
I mean, just to have a chat...

214
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,731
An outing...

215
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:50,937
Besides, if she saw both of us, she'd be much happier!

216
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:52,468
Alright, take her along.

217
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:56,259
After all, Arifa's her friend before she's yours.

218
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,889
Come.

219
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,296
She doesn't seem right.

220
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:10,946
She'll be alright once she's learnt to cook dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice].

221
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,407
Who

222
00:16:26,407 --> 00:16:28,986
Got this picture up here?

223
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,100
Had it just been Dad's picture,

224
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,799
I'd keep it this close to my heart.

225
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:47,177
But this is a picture of Reverend Subhanallah,

226
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:53,003
The father of an Afzal earning his lawful 10,000 Rupees a month.

227
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:57,631
The sight of 98,000 won in a gamble in my pocket would torment him.

228
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:01,092
Just think what he'd do if he saw millions now.

229
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:04,043
Or, think what I'd do...

230
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,957
And this,

231
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,502
Is the commander

232
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,366
Of Dad's legion of virtue

233
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:12,711
Up in arms against sin.

234
00:17:14,716 --> 00:17:16,596
She'd destroy

235
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:20,247
Every trace of immorality with one slap.

236
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,910
Take this picture off.

237
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:36,360
Otherwise, they'd have their eyes on me,

238
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,706
And I won't be able to look straight into the mirror.

239
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,097
Oh! In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].
-Peace be upon you, Uncle Reverend.

240
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:05,240
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

241
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,617
Over here, Arifa!

242
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,959
Both Farah and Lubna have come!

243
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,586
Bring them here, will you?

244
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,816
They've come here to take care of me.

245
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,497
She's not ill at all.

246
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:27,058
She's just putting up an act.

247
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,180
I've come, too.

248
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,151
Seize my hand, too; you'll gain from it.

249
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,797
Come.

250
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,510
Peace be upon you.

251
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,012
And upon you, peace.

252
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,910
What'd you do here?

253
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,580
You'd said the other day

254
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,343
That you see Afzal

255
00:19:01,343 --> 00:19:05,174
When you look at Farah,

256
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:10,405
So, I thought I'd look at my Afzal for a while too.

257
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,027
I'd just said it --

258
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:17,120
So to speak...

259
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,127
She may mind it

260
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,980
If you say it to her face.

261
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,357
No.

262
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,818
I don't mind it.

263
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:27,310
I'm not ill at all.

264
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,540
I'm just putting up an act.

265
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,602
There!

266
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,216
Didn't I say just that?

267
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,917
I'd heard it, Reverend.

268
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,807
Get us some tea.

269
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,720
Come here everyday until I get better.

270
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,030
Call me

271
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,727
If you're busy.

272
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:52,876
No.

273
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:55,517
I'll come here everyday.

274
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,080
You're very compassionate.

275
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,722
You have pity on the ill.

276
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:02,867
No, Aunt.

277
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,773
I love you very much.

278
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,076
I love you very much, too.

279
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,416
Did you talk to him?

280
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:25,272
We saw him on the TV the other day...

281
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:29,171
He was standing next to a minister.

282
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:36,052
He thinks it was Afzal.
-It was surely Afzal, Ruqaiyya Begum.

283
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:40,710
Granted, I'd only glimpsed him,

284
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,247
But I'm his father.

285
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:48,776
I can recognise him even when he's got his back towards me.

286
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,252
Would you look at that!

287
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,980
He's showed himself on TV...

288
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,907
But he couldn't show himself around here, at home...

289
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,568
He will.

290
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:01,569
He will, one day.

291
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,717
You've started thinking like me, now!

292
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,986
Where are you off to?

293
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:15,529
I

294
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:18,680
Thought I'd get some snacks to go along with the tea.
-No...

295
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,557
There's no need --

296
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:21,946
Let him go.

297
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:24,380
He just needed an excuse to leave.

298
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,700
Why an excuse?

299
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,530
You just said, 'He will come one day'.

300
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,031
It's hurt him.

301
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,811
Hey!

302
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,551
The homecoming

303
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:37,962
Of the one whose absence torments him would hurt him?

304
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:42,010
That's why I'm ill, too.

305
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:47,560
He's pronounced a judgement and declared him a pariah.

306
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,716
He torments for his son,

307
00:21:52,716 --> 00:21:57,637
But he'd never let a sinner set foot in the house.

308
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,496
So, Farah's getting married?

309
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:50,526
Hey!

310
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:52,757
Who told you?

311
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,690
She told me herself the day before yesterday.

312
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,287
Would you see that!

313
00:22:57,287 --> 00:22:58,786
Yes...

314
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,471
I'm seeing everything...

315
00:23:01,471 --> 00:23:06,042
All the stories are going to end, now, one by one.

316
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:10,250
I'd write in my diary someday,

317
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,556
'There was one Farah',

318
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,577
'My best friend's sister',

319
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:16,536
'And then there was my best friend'.

320
00:23:16,536 --> 00:23:20,247
'Who knows where the two of them would be now'...

321
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,100
On the page next to it, I'd write,

322
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,040
'There was one Afzal',

323
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,636
'My brother, dearer to me than my life';

324
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:39,006
'But his life was not dear to him'.

325
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,240
Nothing will happen to him.

326
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,917
He'll come back one day.

327
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,256
You'll see,

328
00:24:06,256 --> 00:24:11,736
He'll be gambling on matches with the old colony lads, just like old times.

329
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,071
Who's she marrying?

330
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:20,477
A psychiatrist from around here.

331
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,726
Is he better than Afzal?

332
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:28,064
I mean,

333
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:30,795
He'd be very good...

334
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,847
Does she like him?

335
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,220
The tea's boiling...

336
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,396
Right...

337
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,331
She had to like him...

338
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,541
It was Dad's order

339
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:48,040
'I will not hear any excuses'!

340
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,636
She, too, figured

341
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:52,108
That there's no option other than accepting him.

342
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,666
When's the wedding?

343
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,851
Judging by the bustle, sometime very soon!

344
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:02,886
I'd known it already.

345
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:08,130
The day Afzal murdered Wali,

346
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,316
I said,

347
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:13,996
'Farah's out of the picture'.

348
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,968
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace, Reverend.

349
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:51,950
How are you?

350
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,610
The Lord has been kind.
-What'd you like?

351
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,540
Just

352
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,856
Some of these biscuits,

353
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:02,526
One fruit cake, and

354
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,951
These cake rusks.

355
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,226
Aye, laddie, what are you looking at?

356
00:26:08,226 --> 00:26:09,710
Give the Reverend some cold drinks.

357
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,596
No, I'm not having any cold drinks.

358
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,040
By the way, you didn't even ask

359
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,510
'How many biscuits', and

360
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,316
'How many cake rusks'?

361
00:26:18,316 --> 00:26:19,150
Reverend,

362
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,124
I'm having a kilo of each packed.

363
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:22,680
No, my good man...

364
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,061
Not a kilo each...

365
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,590
A quarter of each.

366
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,947
Leave that to me, Reverend.

367
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:30,824
Why, good sir?

368
00:26:30,824 --> 00:26:32,904
I'm buying,

369
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:36,467
So, it'll be as per my order.

370
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,929
The

371
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,060
Thing is,

372
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,330
I've also brought money for just a quarter of each.

373
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,371
Who's asking for any money, Reverend?

374
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,427
You won't ask for money, old chap?

375
00:26:49,427 --> 00:26:50,270
Why?

376
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,166
Feel at home, Reverend.

377
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,534
Afzal's your son,

378
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:55,185
He's like a brother to me.

379
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:58,565
Who asks one's brother for payment?

380
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:03,145
When I was just a trifling father,

381
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:05,736
You'd take the money from me.

382
00:27:05,736 --> 00:27:08,345
You never thought, then,

383
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:12,096
'Who asks one's father for payment'?

384
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,447
Take your biscuits and cake rusks.

385
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:20,098
You've said such

386
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,799
Sinful words in relation to these.

387
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,337
Reverend!

388
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:28,638
Hey!

389
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:30,243
Hey --

390
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,027
The Reverend's gait has slowed down

391
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:53,810
Ever since he's run away.

392
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,050
He would've reached the bakery late.

393
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,761
You should've stopped him.

394
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:00,282
You let him go for nothing, really...

395
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:02,323
It was necessary that he go.

396
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:06,874
He makes sure to walk 200 steps when he's angry.

397
00:28:07,794 --> 00:28:09,324
Anyway,

398
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:10,596
Have your tea,

399
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:14,391
And make do with your Aunt's affection.

400
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,767
Would the wedding be fixed directly,

401
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,870
Or is an engagement planned?

402
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,720
There'll be an engagement before that.

403
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,787
Just think that the engagement's this week.

404
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,066
You'd invite us to the engagement, won't you?

405
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:39,206
Or would you skip us, remembering us as hopefuls the first time around?

406
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:40,310
Look,

407
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,361
I've forgotten it entirely.

408
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,551
You haven't forgotten it at all.

409
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:49,500
I haven't forgotten it either.

410
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,457
I remember how I gave sorrow,

411
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:57,400
And how you braved through that sorrow.

412
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,204
I'd remember that ring

413
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,646
When I'd wear any other ring

414
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:05,966
That Uncle Reverend had quietly kept in his pocket again.

415
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,460
You're under my oath,

416
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,177
Once I'm married, don't bless me;

417
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:24,146
Just remember me and say,

418
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:26,020
'To you, your way, Farah',

419
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,931
'We forgive you'.

420
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,701
I can't sit here any longer today.

421
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,290
Hey!

422
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,791
You're leaving?

423
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:11,048
You've had tea, haven't you?

424
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:12,722
Yes...

425
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,530
So,

426
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,290
What's with these tears?

427
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:22,958
Who's made her cry?

428
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,246
She's getting married.

429
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:28,996
She's crying out of the grief of separation.

430
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,088
Oh,

431
00:30:31,088 --> 00:30:32,379
Right...

432
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:36,864
So she's crying just as a formality, so to speak!

433
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,385
Don't cry when you come here again.

434
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:45,975
I'll serve you some of the finest coconut biscuits, aye!

435
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,362
She may be the first girl who's wept in sorrow for you.

436
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:33,994
That's why you've started missing her.

437
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,287
Marry her.

438
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,820
You couldn't get anything in love.

439
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,316
Give someone something, and get even.

440
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,340
Are you crazy?

441
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,510
You want that I should give her four days of my life that I've got left, and ruin forty years of hers?

442
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,336
If love gets four days,

443
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:52,391
It doesn't bother about forty years.

444
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,927
I've seen her condition.

445
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:58,327
She sees you a hundred times in one glance.

446
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,528
God have mercy on my Mum;

447
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:06,190
She'd say, 'Marry the girl who loves you',

448
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,568
'Not the one whom only you love [but doesn't love you back]'.

449
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:14,540
She's taken great care of me for four months, mate...

450
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,916
She's a right spitfire.

451
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:21,002
Seeing her, it doesn't seem that she could love anyone, really.

452
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:24,023
But --
-If you commit the sin of kicking love away,

453
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:25,863
It'll kill you one day.

454
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:31,964
Anytime you laugh, it'd torment you that she weeps at the thought of you.

455
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,836
Here's an idea.

456
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,906
Never think of her again.

457
00:32:36,906 --> 00:32:40,651
Don't remember, also, that she'd taken good care of you for four months,

458
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:41,756
Nor that

459
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:43,266
You have pity on her

460
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:45,327
When she weeps.

461
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:48,136
I won't think of her again.

462
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,737
More than a hundred Englishmen in Yorkshire

463
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,990
Have taken to playing gilli danda [Asian sport], I tell you!

464
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,021
And the credit goes to me!

465
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm settling the scores with them.

466
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,611
I'll ruin them with this habit of gilli danda

467
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:24,037
The same way the buggers had ruined India!

468
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,320
But, Monseigneur,

469
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,340
Even a single man there

470
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,350
Is like a nation by himself.

471
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,418
Touché on that.

472
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:55,704
That's why even gilli danda can't ruin them.

473
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,136
Sit over here.

474
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:20,863
I know the history of this room.

475
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:23,458
You bring anyone you want to insult here.

476
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:26,228
The history of this room is about to change tonight.

477
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:29,089
I've brought you here to tell you

478
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:31,129
That I've decided to marry you.

479
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:31,969
What?

480
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,360
Hold your horses!

481
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,657
Listen to the whole thing.

482
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,048
I'm listening.

483
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,419
You don't listen to the heart, do you?

484
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:42,340
I will keep on listening to it, now...

485
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,341
By the way, you're not a good psychiatrist either.

486
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:47,816
Look,

487
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:51,511
You may insult me, but do not say a word against my profession.

488
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:52,471
Know what,

489
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:53,880
We'd just get married.

490
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,890
We'll never be able to love each other.

491
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,001
I don't care.

492
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:59,392
Love isn't required to get married.

493
00:34:59,392 --> 00:35:02,652
Know what, there's no feeling like 'love', psychologically speaking.

494
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:05,523
It's just a knavish trick to have one's way and get to that end.

495
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:07,975
But marriage is no trick; it's a contract.

496
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:11,188
A lifelong contract between two parties.

497
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:12,720
Even if the world turns upside-down,

498
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,566
One's got to stand by that contract.

499
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:17,196
So you don't believe in love at all?

500
00:35:17,196 --> 00:35:18,640
When did I say that?

501
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,760
I do, but

502
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,309
I don't believe in marrying out of love.

503
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,675
Do you know, most of my patients are that sort --

504
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:29,131
The kind who'd loved before marriage.

505
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:31,510
When I see anyone in love, I say,

506
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,951
'Aye, yer comin' to me, laddie'...

507
00:35:35,897 --> 00:35:38,558
That's just what I deserve...

508
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:40,118
What?

509
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:43,888
I'm getting married to a lowlife like you!

510
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,940
This is very insulting!

511
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,540
I'll have this one specifically written in the contract

512
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:59,986
That you can't insult me again and again like this!

513
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,657
Why are you picking your nose?

514
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:23,989
Come here.

515
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,640
Over here.

516
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,811
Come here.

517
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,471
Show me your hand.

518
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,722
Like this.

519
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:36,048
Hey! Don't hit him!

520
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:39,292
I'm not hitting him, Mam; I'm just scaring him.

521
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:40,493
Go back and sit.

522
00:36:40,493 --> 00:36:44,253
And don't you dare pick your nose again.

523
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,356
Alright, where were we?

524
00:36:50,596 --> 00:36:53,935
Mam, would you see who it is?

525
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,620
Alright...

526
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,927
Ifrah!

527
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,516
You're sleeping when I'm teaching?

528
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:19,857
Come here.

529
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,060
Over here.

530
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,401
Show me your hand.

531
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,541
Properly. Like this.

532
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,331
Hey! Don't hit her!

533
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,975
I'm not hitting her; I'm just scaring her!

534
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,380
The tea's fantastic.

535
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,250
Why were you surprised to see me?

536
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,800
Because we met again the very next day.

537
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,899
But why are you skirting around the point?

538
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:10,316
Get to the point, will you?

539
00:38:11,106 --> 00:38:12,746
The point?

540
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:15,206
You said yesterday that you like me,

541
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:17,107
Alright, thank you very much.

542
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,917
Go on.

543
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:24,017
What it is is, I'm the kind of girl who'd talk in a clear-cut and to-the-point way.

544
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:29,997
I don't like it that a don type chap like you should say one half and hold the other half in.

545
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,410
I'd said something else to you, too.

546
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,779
I think I forgot...

547
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:39,120
Remind me again?

548
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,456
You've forgotten too, innit?

549
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,130
How couldn't you?

550
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,691
Just a thought of me is enough to cause this memory loss of yours.

551
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:53,891
Whatever would you remember if I stood firm before you?

552
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:56,471
Besides, which muppet would say in a surprise meeting,

553
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,462
'Listen, my dear, I don't love you'.

554
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,172
Be a man, Afzal Subhanallah.

555
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:07,808
I find those who talk politics before saying 'I love you' rather toxic!

556
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,026
I love someone else, Jasmine.

557
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:25,345
<i>Every compeer abandoned me...</i>

558
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,169
There's something new!

559
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:30,530
Now you sound like a man!

560
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,720
Just that, or are you going to add anything else?

561
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,867
I mean,

562
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,058
What's her name,

563
00:39:41,058 --> 00:39:43,381
Where does she live...

564
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,976
You don't really have to reply,

565
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:50,121
But I can't help it; I'm a girl...

566
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,431
I'd even ask such meaningless questions.

567
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:55,912
How does she look?

568
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,016
Well, to the devil with her looks.

569
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:05,517
What does love care if the lass looks as lush as Jasmine or not...

570
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,989
Is it the same one, by any chance, who'd come from Hyderabad?

571
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:11,602
Farah!

572
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:14,023
Farah Ibrahim!

573
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:15,852
There!

574
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:20,083
My Spidey Sense had started tingling the moment I'd seen her.

575
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,264
I won't tell you her name.

576
00:40:26,264 --> 00:40:27,903
Why?

577
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,936
She doesn't love me.

578
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:35,229
So everything's going on one-sided?

579
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:36,566
There!

580
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,910
Mam had been right all along, hadn't she?

581
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,806
So, there was a lass after all!

582
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,091
And you're such a secret squirrel

583
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:46,812
That you never let anyone know for five months!

584
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:50,088
You didn't even let <i>me</i> find out!

585
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,811
Alright, don't tell me her name.

586
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:56,184
Just tell me this -

587
00:40:56,184 --> 00:40:59,234
Is she more beautiful than me?

588
00:40:59,234 --> 00:41:04,750
She's very beautiful, Jasmine,

589
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,066
But not more than you.

590
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,000
Loser...

591
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
