1
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:13,859
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:19,094
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:24,218
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:30,548
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:36,184
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,184 --> 00:00:40,812
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,965
You're not sleeping, Reverend.

8
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:37,545
You're just pretending.

9
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,494
I took the pill too.

10
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:46,047
But I couldn't fall asleep.

11
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,691
You took the pill a tad late,

12
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:53,176
Which is why you'd

13
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:58,082
Fall asleep a tad late.

14
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,919
The deal's no more now.

15
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,475
I'd even asked him

16
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:48,912
Not to bring his parents here.

17
00:02:48,912 --> 00:02:50,633
But I don't know why

18
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:52,787
He brought you here

19
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:57,011
Without telling me or asking me about it!

20
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:04,213
I know

21
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:07,183
A moment's daftness brought me here.

22
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:10,447
But I'd never thought I'd call you here and decline.

23
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:16,010
And I swear by God, I don't even know your Afzal well enough!

24
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:54,243
No.

25
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,195
I'm not being demure.

26
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,821
It is with regret that I have to say this,

27
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,276
But no such engagement will take place here

28
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:06,898
That you are so euphoric about.

29
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,576
It's all because of him!

30
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,515
He's a first rate fraudster.

31
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:18,368
The move he's played

32
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:20,338
Even after everything was decided

33
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:23,866
Is one I'll never forgive him for!

34
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:25,993
Forget getting engaged to him,

35
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:31,013
I don't even want to see his face!

36
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,338
There!

37
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:43,683
Your Afzal is here!

38
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:48,503
Go and welcome him, then.

39
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:51,475
I'm feeling sleepy.

40
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,649
People look good when they speak the truth.

41
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,399
But you're one

42
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,403
I feel affection for even as you lie.

43
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,759
Get some sleep, Reverend.

44
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,500
It's better for his health.

45
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,759
By the way, the lassie's still awake.

46
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,720
She'll take care of everything.

47
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,880
He'd be a bit drenched, that's all.

48
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,337
Take off your coat.

49
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,591
Take off your shoes.

50
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:23,671
Go to bed if you've had your dinner.

51
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:26,701
Otherwise, take something from the fridge.

52
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:29,861
Has Dad retired?

53
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,435
It's 1.30 a.m.

54
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:35,091
Do you think he'd be awake?

55
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,965
Just --

56
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,777
Check for once.

57
00:07:40,777 --> 00:07:42,339
Why?

58
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,138
If I go to bed without talking to him,

59
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:46,842
Neither of us would be able to fall asleep.

60
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,169
Talk to me!

61
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,658
Relieve yourself of the burden of whatever truth or lie you want to tell!

62
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,579
I'll only talk to Dad.

63
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,567
Then hold it until the morning.

64
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,301
You'd be kicked out of the house if you say something that makes things worse.

65
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:03,708
Can you see the downpour outside?

66
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,894
Alright.

67
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,260
I'll sit here until daybreak.

68
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,171
Have you no shame?

69
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:19,343
Is not one imbroglio enough for you?

70
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:24,685
You have no idea how you've wracked our hearts!

71
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:26,781
I do.

72
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,748
Then stay quiet until Dad says something,

73
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:32,177
Else, you'd get killed for sure!

74
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:35,267
I've been killed already...

75
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,470
Will Dad kill me again?

76
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,285
He's fine now.

77
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:17,796
His blood pressure is normal again.

78
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,780
He's taken his medicines and is about to go to bed.

79
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,249
You'd better be normal again.

80
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:28,436
Over here, everyone has a rather weak memory.

81
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,844
We forget today's news by tomorrow.

82
00:09:30,844 --> 00:09:34,050
Tomorrow, even Dad would have forgotten what happened today.

83
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,799
Did he mention me when saying anything?

84
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,284
He mentioned God and said something.

85
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,234
Perhaps he was praying?

86
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:44,233
He didn't even get angry with me?

87
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,201
Not at all.

88
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,982
Mum would be cursing me.

89
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,516
Not at all.

90
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:51,609
She was just concerned about Dad.

91
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,883
Then why wasn't I allowed to see Dad?

92
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,208
Because of Dad.

93
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,042
I've heard

94
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:02,149
He used to get scared by ghosts when he was young.

95
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,287
He's affrighted.

96
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:07,222
His blood pressure didn't shoot up today,

97
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:09,239
It plummeted.

98
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:12,206
The doctor said this happens only

99
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:15,688
When one is utterly shocked.

100
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,268
He was asking what had happened.

101
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,439
What could Mum say?

102
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:23,071
After all, she can't say that the father's afraid of his daughter!

103
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,430
Stop it, Lubna.

104
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:39,976
Don't show yourself before Dad for a few days.

105
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,462
Why not?

106
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:45,590
Dad's going through a memory loss.

107
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,500
His memory may come back at the sight of you.

108
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,472
Okay?

109
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,428
Good night.

110
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,143
Wait, Lubna.

111
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:57,643
I can't wait.

112
00:10:57,643 --> 00:10:59,236
Mum's said it firmly,

113
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:04,251
'Whoever stays with Farah shall be held responsible for his own words and deeds'!

114
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,600
Sit down.

115
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,551
Sit.

116
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:24,079
Orders,

117
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,559
Sir?

118
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,257
Please ask Arifa

119
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:34,188
To go to her room.

120
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,446
Go, my dear.

121
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:43,665
He's getting embarrassed in your presence.

122
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:57,517
What are your orders for your Mum?

123
00:12:57,517 --> 00:13:01,675
She's eager to come here too.

124
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,648
There's nothing to conceal from Mum.

125
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:08,975
I just feel embarrassed before my sister.

126
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,691
Come here, Ruqaiyya!

127
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:14,425
You've been granted permission!

128
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:29,338
So it's been decided that he'd sit and talk,

129
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:32,264
And we'd listen.

130
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,627
Holding back would make no difference,

131
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,455
And if necessary, we'd speak too.

132
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,751
Isn't it

133
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,096
My dear,

134
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:43,564
May we

135
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,113
Speak sometimes, too, or

136
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,103
Is it that only you'd speak

137
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,757
And we'd listen?

138
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,963
I know I've wronged both of you.

139
00:13:57,576 --> 00:14:00,156
It would've been more proper that you'd speak

140
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,961
And I'd listen.

141
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:05,295
But please -- listen to just one thing I have to say.

142
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,917
And say everything that you want to.

143
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:10,843
Go on.

144
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:14,275
I confess

145
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:19,291
That I'd known she'd refuse in front of everyone.

146
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,541
Regardless, I took you there.

147
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,839
Splendid, my son.

148
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,608
We're delighted to know you'd drag us

149
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:31,064
To drown where the waters are deep.

150
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:34,376
I've drowned too, Mum.

151
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:37,782
This is why I'm saying to you

152
00:14:37,782 --> 00:14:41,407
That I want to come ashore.

153
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,564
Alright.

154
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,993
Continue.

155
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:52,103
I wanted the answer to a question.

156
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:56,604
Do I have the right to love a girl

157
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,947
Who doesn't even know me well?

158
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,979
Who, then, is the one who writes you letters?

159
00:15:08,979 --> 00:15:12,056
Forget the one who writes letters, Dad.

160
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:13,759
Please, answer my question.

161
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,274
Hear the answer from me:

162
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:20,602
The perfidious have no right to fancy anyone here or there.

163
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:24,182
You've transgressed every limit of shame and morality.

164
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:27,993
I'm Reverend Subhanallah's son, Mum.

165
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:32,437
I can neither go back on my word, nor two-time anyone.

166
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:35,220
I'd just request you

167
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,910
To allow me to get my answer from Dad.

168
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,613
I think that to love such a girl is not comme il faut.

169
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,128
This

170
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:53,244
Would be like trespassing on her modesty.

171
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,271
What kind of a trespass, Dad?

172
00:15:56,271 --> 00:16:00,597
Neither have I said anything to her nor asserted my right to love her.

173
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:03,696
Then why did you take us there?

174
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,136
Why do you go to the Mosque?

175
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,552
Do you go there out of love for Him,

176
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,347
Or do your job for the neighbourhood?

177
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,665
Oh God!

178
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:18,880
This blighter's become a blasphemer!
-Shut up, Ruqaiyya!

179
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,097
Let me talk.

180
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:25,437
No, my son.

181
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:28,090
I don't do a job.

182
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,825
I love Him.

183
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:32,273
Have you ever talked to Him?

184
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:37,231
Have you ever met Him?
-If only one person alone were dear to Him, one would meet...

185
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,124
And then,

186
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,406
He asks us to love Him.

187
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:42,830
And what if one does not?

188
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,903
He loves him regardless, doesn't he?

189
00:16:45,903 --> 00:16:51,465
There are thousands in the world who neither believe in nor love Him.

190
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:55,418
Does He not love them all, regardless?

191
00:16:55,418 --> 00:16:57,590
So?

192
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:03,995
I've started down God's path, Dad.

193
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:07,612
I will keep on loving

194
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:09,988
Whether she does or not.

195
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,209
Go on, my good man.

196
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,145
Keep on loving.

197
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:20,364
Let me know what I can do for you.

198
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:22,302
Allow me --

199
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,820
Allow as in,

200
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,520
Give it in writing that such invisible love of yours for any girl

201
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,336
Is justified?

202
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,355
Not at all.

203
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:36,738
I'm leaving Hyderabad.

204
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,379
Where to?

205
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,916
Karachi.

206
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:54,721
Has your spiritual guide asked that you should

207
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:59,575
Start this sermon of love there?

208
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:02,155
I'm going to try out my luck, Dad.

209
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:04,938
Then try your luck, my dear,

210
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:07,296
Don't try our endurance.

211
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:11,249
Set for us only such little trials as this,

212
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:16,065
And take us along to a girl's house,

213
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:18,516
We'd go with you,

214
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,515
Hear a refusal,

215
00:18:20,515 --> 00:18:23,521
Come back,

216
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,407
And fall asleep after taking sleeping pills.

217
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:30,139
Today, too, we have taken sleeping pills.

218
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,776
But the two of us couldn't sleep.

219
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:35,330
Do you know why?

220
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,131
You'd not come home.

221
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,548
Now that you're here,

222
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:40,953
You'll see

223
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,692
How well the pill works!

224
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,136
Get up, Ruqaiyya.

225
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:54,481
Before he talks about parting again,

226
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,669
And wracks my heart with grief,

227
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,840
We should better leave.

228
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,277
I'm leaving, Dad.

229
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:07,559
You blighter!

230
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:13,061
You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

231
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,837
And you'd leave those who love you

232
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:16,930
In Hyderabad?

233
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,914
This habit of yours isn't good, Ruqaiyya.

234
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:24,417
You whack him the moment

235
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:28,525
Something rubs you the wrong way.

236
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:33,469
I had a few opportunities like this, too,

237
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:37,240
But I did not raise my hand.

238
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:39,718
And

239
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:43,985
What good is striking him, Ruqaiyya Begum,

240
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:50,689
Who'd strike a fatal blow to us with his separation?

241
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:53,499
Come.

242
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,368
Get some sleep.

243
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,868
Otherwise,

244
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:01,203
It'll prove the chemist wrong.

245
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,336
He was saying

246
00:20:02,336 --> 00:20:04,463
The pill would

247
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:07,969
Get you drowsy within 15 minutes.

248
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,783
Come.

249
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,613
Are you going barmy?

250
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,034
You humiliate and give sorrow,

251
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,926
And shatter hearts,

252
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,846
And then stay awake?

253
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,063
I'm going to University.

254
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,752
You have five minutes if you want to come.

255
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,254
Get your bag and come with me.

256
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,878
Give me the five minutes

257
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,314
That you have.

258
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,335
What do you mean?

259
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:07,347
Sit by me.

260
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,311
Here.

261
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,874
I did what was right, didn't I?

262
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:21,208
Yes, you did exactly what was right,

263
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,146
How dare he bring his parents here,

264
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:26,750
And think you'd get engaged to him?

265
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,092
Then why is Dad furious?

266
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:32,094
And why is Mum not talking to me?

267
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:34,127
It's hit them a bit hard.

268
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,581
They got to know the real story

269
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:39,452
When the engagement got cancelled.

270
00:21:39,452 --> 00:21:40,780
You're telling the truth, aren't you?

271
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,682
I swear by you, I am.

272
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:44,795
Initially, I was a bit angry with you,

273
00:21:44,795 --> 00:21:46,314
Then, I thought over it and felt

274
00:21:46,314 --> 00:21:49,108
That that's what you should've done.

275
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,002
He shocked us all.

276
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,546
When we'd clearly stopped him,

277
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:53,936
Told him not to come,

278
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,952
He showed up regardless!

279
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:59,326
And why did he bring his parents and Arifa along?

280
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:00,827
The blighter would've thought

281
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:03,040
'The girl's parents have agreed'.

282
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,039
'How about attempting an engagement'?

283
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,666
And you thought all along he'd be virtuous and irreproachable, being a Reverend's son.

284
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,433
Well,

285
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,711
His previous reputation wasn't exactly good either.

286
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:12,900
I still thought

287
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,056
He's been ousted from his job and in need of one,

288
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:16,775
And he's Arifa's brother,

289
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:17,872
So,

290
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:21,026
He'd earn some being of help to us.

291
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:22,586
I will give him his money anyhow.

292
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:26,009
In all honesty, I'd shove it in his face!

293
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:27,749
But, Lubna,

294
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:29,596
I pity that girl

295
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:32,076
With whom he's got an exchange of letters going on.

296
00:22:32,076 --> 00:22:33,373
The poor lass.

297
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:37,156
Her heart would be struck with woe if she found out!

298
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,498
If I ever came across her,

299
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:42,015
I'd narrate each of Monsieur Afzal's glorious adventures!

300
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:43,733
Girls are raving mad.

301
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,700
Look at the kind they fall for!

302
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:48,060
By the way,

303
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,405
Why haven't you slept all night?

304
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:50,874
I was delighted!

305
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:54,735
Even more so because I didn't do anything stupid this time!

306
00:22:54,735 --> 00:22:57,373
Finished him off in a flash!

307
00:22:57,373 --> 00:22:58,863
Let's go to University, then, shall we?

308
00:22:58,863 --> 00:23:00,046
Why are you sitting?

309
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,095
Get in the car.

310
00:23:01,095 --> 00:23:03,885
I'm coming in two minutes!

311
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,361
God forgive, Reverend,

312
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,283
Last night's sleeping pill struck more like a pellet.

313
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,943
You even missed your morning prayers!

314
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:09,828
Why do tough times always make you miss your morning prayers?

315
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,454
Go and give it to him.

316
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:13,789
Give the blighter whatever he wants in his room.

317
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:16,567
I'd rather not glimpse him.

318
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,117
What was I saying?

319
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:28,089
You were talking about missing my morning prayers.

320
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:29,276
Right,

321
00:24:29,276 --> 00:24:31,217
What am I remembering!

322
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:33,355
Her name was 'Fajr' [daybreak] too, wasn't it?

323
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,651
Your aunt's daughter.

324
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:38,001
You also 'missed' her!

325
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,717
Yes.

326
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:41,511
If I see her somewhere,

327
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,565
She calls me 'brother'.

328
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,950
What else can she do now?

329
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,669
And what else can you do now?

330
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:50,295
When the 'daybreak' is your beloved,

331
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:54,432
You don't compensate for 'missing' it!

332
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:56,432
Don't take refuge behind your son

333
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:59,885
And cast these aspersions on me, Ruqaiyya Begum!

334
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:03,964
The son no longer has a place in my heart, Reverend.

335
00:25:03,964 --> 00:25:06,932
I've locked all motherly affection in a casket.

336
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:07,983
Didn't you see

337
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:11,698
How I didn't even call him for breakfast?

338
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,873
He must be saying, 'I'll have breakfast with Dad'.

339
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:18,549
Make it clear to him:

340
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,763
'You shall not have such good fortune'.

341
00:25:20,763 --> 00:25:24,467
He's not in his room, Mum.

342
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,978
Where's he gone?

343
00:25:29,978 --> 00:25:32,011
No idea.

344
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:33,510
It kills me to hear this!

345
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,258
He's left, Reverend!

346
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:37,696
Reverend, he's left us!

347
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:39,630
The blighter has taken after his father!

348
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,802
He does exactly as he says!

349
00:25:41,802 --> 00:25:43,333
What are you looking at, sitting like this?

350
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:43,866
Go!

351
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,536
Bring him back, Reverend,

352
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,614
Bring him back!

353
00:25:46,614 --> 00:25:49,114
Or else I'm gone.

354
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:51,441
Get a grip on yourself, Ruqaiyya.

355
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:53,191
He's not going anywhere.

356
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,308
Call him.

357
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:01,861
You can have me promise it, Reverend.

358
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,721
I won't slap him.

359
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,160
Would you look at that, Lubna!

360
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,660
He's standing in the way smoking cigarettes!

361
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:58,419
Know what, he'd be smoking cigarettes standing in the way like this everyday!

362
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,297
You don't know me, then.

363
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:01,940
If I saw him again,

364
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,077
You'll see what I make of him!

365
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:19,751
Hello?

366
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,329
Yes, where are you?

367
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:23,819
You're here, aren't you?

368
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,839
In Hyderabad?

369
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,883
Yes, Mum,

370
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:28,192
I'm here.

371
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,463
I'm with Timmy

372
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:32,989
Going to apply for a job.

373
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:36,459
Why didn't you have your breakfast, then?

374
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,676
I will have my breakfast.

375
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:41,025
When your anger wanes,

376
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:42,994
I'll have breakfast with Dad.

377
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,690
There!

378
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,874
Has your Dad forbidden you?

379
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,481
You have forbidden me.

380
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:51,572
I'd heard it.

381
00:27:51,572 --> 00:27:52,859
Alright,

382
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,579
Now don't blabber on like that.

383
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:55,498
Disconnect now,

384
00:27:55,498 --> 00:27:56,594
Come back quickly,

385
00:27:56,594 --> 00:27:59,830
And have your lunch with Dad.

386
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:02,439
Yes, Mum.

387
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:10,579
The blighter's here

388
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:14,922
Stravaiging about with his dosser friends.

389
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,154
Right, now, what do you want to do?

390
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,185
Mate,

391
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:39,216
I want to become a great man.

392
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:42,920
You think I can make you a great man?

393
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,951
You bugger!

394
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,732
What are you talking about and with whom!

395
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:48,482
I'm honest, Timmy.

396
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,533
There's one way, mate.

397
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,474
Tell your Oul Fella and have your name changed

398
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:55,129
To 'Great Man'.

399
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,875
Sajid and I will have the entire neighbourhood remember it.

400
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,466
Everyone would say at your very sight,

401
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:02,169
'Great Man' is coming.

402
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,930
Give me the cigarette.

403
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:27,851
I'm talking about a real great man.

404
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:30,012
At the sight of whom, you'd say,

405
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:32,544
'That's Afzal',

406
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,626
And the people say, 'Behold'!

407
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:37,951
'He's a great man'!

408
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:53,222
Won't you go to office today?

409
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:56,540
I won't for a few more days.

410
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:58,940
I'd called to ask.

411
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,567
Everything's going on fine.

412
00:30:04,425 --> 00:30:06,824
It's better that you talk to her and ask her

413
00:30:06,824 --> 00:30:11,267
Why she did this instead of suffering quietly like this.

414
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,463
I understand her problem.

415
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,433
She'd have an answer.

416
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,485
Then what's your problem?

417
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:26,639
Think about how much it would pain me to see you on the rack like this!

418
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:30,591
Honestly, Irsa,

419
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:34,279
Has such a moment ever befallen me that you felt

420
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,824
I cannot look someone in the eye and talk straight?

421
00:30:36,824 --> 00:30:38,683
Never?

422
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,812
But why do I feel that

423
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:44,628
I wouldn't be able to meet his gaze if he ever showed up before me?

424
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:49,439
Why does my heart say that he's a virtuous man,

425
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,782
He is nothing in his status,

426
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:55,396
But he has the modest and honourable character of a gentleman.

427
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:57,893
If he's thought about Farah,

428
00:30:57,893 --> 00:31:00,484
He's thought only about Farah.

429
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,374
Not for once has he thought about my mill or bank balance.

430
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:06,938
He's one of them, Irsa,

431
00:31:06,938 --> 00:31:13,252
Who'd sell their hide to earn enough to feed their wife.

432
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:15,802
My father used to say

433
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:19,516
That to find a gentleman from among men

434
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:22,687
Is like finding from a heap of watermelons one

435
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:25,750
That's red on the inside.

436
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:51,182
Have some more.

437
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:03,022
Hey!

438
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:03,755
Leave that be.

439
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:04,525
Here.

440
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,586
Have a warm one.

441
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,460
That's enough. I won't have so much.

442
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,335
Why not?

443
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,304
You'll get a fever from the rains if you stay griefstricken like this!

444
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:15,259
Eat as much as you like.

445
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:17,631
Show, by eating, that you don't care the slightest

446
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:19,664
About one who doesn't care about you!

447
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,647
Get a grip on your grief.

448
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:23,384
Don't fear it.

449
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:27,224
What are you talking about?

450
00:34:27,224 --> 00:34:29,462
I'm saying big words, isn't it?

451
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:31,226
Yes...

452
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,022
Do you know

453
00:34:33,022 --> 00:34:36,959
What one wants to achieve by giving someone sorrow?

454
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,866
Ask what one wants!

455
00:34:40,647 --> 00:34:42,147
What?

456
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,600
One wants you to be tormented,

457
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,651
Weep,

458
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:50,583
Wail and tell that you can't take so much grief.

459
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:53,880
But you are Reverend Subhanallah's son.

460
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,502
Neither will you be tormented,

461
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:56,664
Nor weep,

462
00:34:56,664 --> 00:35:01,636
Nor wail to show anyone your grief.

463
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:04,039
Promise me.

464
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,051
Promise me, won't you?

465
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:10,967
I can't promise you.

466
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,185
The thing is

467
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:20,796
I don't quite come up to your expectations.

468
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:25,982
When grief torments me, I cry sometimes too.

469
00:35:33,726 --> 00:35:35,809
Let it never be known that you are tormented

470
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:39,444
Even as the torment kills you.

471
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:41,819
I promise.

472
00:35:54,494 --> 00:35:57,045
She's the one who wrote him the letters, Mum.

473
00:35:57,045 --> 00:36:00,024
Farah Ibrahim.

474
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:13,512
He wasn't there in the morning.

475
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:15,916
So you want to see him there?

476
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:16,808
Yes.

477
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,489
I want that he should show up once more.

478
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:20,682
You'll see,

479
00:36:20,682 --> 00:36:22,309
I'll give him a right thrashing!

480
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:23,635
Enough, Farah.

481
00:36:23,635 --> 00:36:24,916
He's Arifa's brother.

482
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,697
What if he's Arifa's brother?

483
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:29,509
Every cad has an honourable sister.

484
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:30,653
The poor lass.

485
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,571
She's my friend, Farah.

486
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:36,026
And only I know how distressed she must be after that day.

487
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:38,026
I have all my sympathies for her,

488
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:40,424
But I can't help it.

489
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:50,601
What happened?

490
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:53,713
No idea. I'll go and check.

491
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,463
Look over there.

492
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:07,343
What's there?

493
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:09,032
This is the same ground, isn't it,

494
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:12,541
Where he'd sit with his lunch box?

495
00:37:13,309 --> 00:37:14,181
So what?

496
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:16,259
Why are we talking about him?

497
00:37:16,259 --> 00:37:18,085
We're not talking about him, Farah.

498
00:37:18,085 --> 00:37:21,351
His mention's just coming up.

499
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:24,775
Will it get moving again or remain here?

500
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:29,963
Give me two minutes. There's a problem with the wiring; I'll fix it.

501
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:34,588
Offer your prayers

502
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,807
If there's someone's mausoleum here.

503
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:38,479
It does feel, indeed,

504
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,573
As if it's someone's mausoleum there.

505
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,015
Over there,

506
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:45,574
That's where the cricket ball had hit his lunch box,

507
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:50,292
And his piece of bread flung out of his hand.

508
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:52,571
There's a mausoleum over there,

509
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:56,780
Where he's interred his heart.

510
00:38:28,825 --> 00:38:31,357
You've started smoking?

511
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,999
I'm telling the Reverend!

512
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,373
Eladio!

513
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:36,607
Eladio!

514
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:38,485
Hey, Eladio!

515
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,257
Hey!

516
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:39,971
You --

517
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,173
Listen!

518
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:42,865
Stop!

519
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:54,033
C'mon, Rashid --

520
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,442
Wait, Rashid.

521
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:07,400
Do you have the slightest shame?

522
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,449
Farah, let's go --

523
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,917
Hey! Get off!

524
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:13,056
Let me see who's the boss!

525
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:15,870
Now that your engagement plan failed,

526
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,578
You stand in my way to get even?

527
00:39:18,578 --> 00:39:20,793
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

528
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:24,978
Want to besmirch my reputation?

529
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,719
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son,

530
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:34,466
So I thought you wouldn't step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

531
00:39:35,012 --> 00:39:36,511
You'd drown in shame,

532
00:39:36,511 --> 00:39:41,339
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

533
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:43,843
But you turned out so brazen!

534
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,290
Roaming around in the streets like this!

535
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,558
You consider the humiliation your exploit?

536
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:49,373
Enough, Farah!

537
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,807
Le's go --
-Hey!

538
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,841
Put a sock in it!

539
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,179
Look at him!

540
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:00,205
Staring right back!

541
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:02,706
Come, Afzal.
-No.

542
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:05,068
Wait.

543
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,116
I'm saying this for the last time:

544
00:40:14,116 --> 00:40:16,180
If I see you around one more time,

545
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,538
No one in Hyderabad will ever see you again!
-Farah!

546
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:22,071
I'm coming!

547
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
