1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,870
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,080
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,680
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,146
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:40,790
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,866
May I come in, Dad?

8
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,027
Two minutes; that's all you have.

9
00:01:57,027 --> 00:02:00,430
And, for these two minutes,

10
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,857
Stay at an arm's length from me.

11
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,690
Go away!

12
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,648
Away!

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,876
Don't touch me.

14
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,160
Your mother

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,040
Had named you.

16
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,550
I'd said back then, 'Ruqaiyya Begum',

17
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,958
'The name's august'.

18
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,696
'It won't be easy'

19
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:53,117
'To live up to and honour it'.

20
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Why don't you tell me

21
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,080
What kind of an 'Great Person' [Afzal] are you?

22
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,671
Change my name.

23
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,430
I don't know who's the greater one around here -

24
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,330
Those who die in their innocence, or the ones whom I've killed,

25
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,100
Who kill 16-something others,

26
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,900
And parade around the city fearlessly.

27
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,700
I would've become a great man [Afzal], Dad,

28
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,927
If only someone showed me what greatness ought to be like.

29
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,280
You're either at the Mosque, or at home.

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,070
With the Lord there, and the Lord's faithful people here.

31
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,360
You don't know what's going on here, Dad.

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,320
A thief who stole 2 billion is bargained with,

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,970
And another who steals 2,000 is sentenced to two years in prison.

34
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,540
It's just that the petty thief is not respected.

35
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,440
The greatest of thieves are hailed as the greatest of men.

36
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,570
I can't fit in with all of these, Dad,

37
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,365
Which is why I request you to change my name.

38
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,390
Have you convinced your mother?

39
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,960
With my head in her lap,

40
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,431
She was running her fingers through my hair.

41
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,420
She's affrighted

42
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,960
That

43
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,670
You may go back.

44
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,010
Tell me, did she say anything?

45
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,300
Did she talk to you --

46
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,100
Any complaint --

47
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,390
Did she carp about you?

48
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,766
No.

49
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,140
Go to her, then,

50
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,670
And ask her

51
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,166
To give you a tight slap on your face.

52
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,990
Slapping you

53
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,040
Will build her confidence.

54
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,860
What are you looking at?

55
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,870
Go and give her reason to believe

56
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,860
That, even after being slapped, you wouldn't

57
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,560
Dare set foot outside the house!

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,276
Then, she'd

59
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:41,970
Talk to you confidently.

60
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,900
Otherwise, she'd just keep fearing you.

61
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,490
And you'd do well

62
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,597
To fear a mother who's scared, my child.

63
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,337
Arifa!

64
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,778
What are you cooking?

65
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,598
I think --

66
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:20,350
We can prepare chicken pulao; he enjoys it thoroughly.

67
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,160
And some thin green gram lentil along with it.

68
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,047
But no,

69
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:25,887
I don't know if he'll have that...

70
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,600
Get to work already, what are you looking at? Now --

71
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,900
Get some bread and braised meat ready; I'll prepare whatever he'd like to have.

72
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,986
What would you like, Afzal?

73
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,980
I've not been slapped by Mum for so long.

74
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,376
I'd like to have that for starters.

75
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,661
May you live long.

76
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:54,380
You've become a great man,

77
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,740
But haven't forgotten your mother's silly pastimes.

78
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,946
May you be prosperous, my dear.

79
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,386
I'd sworn as I came here

80
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:19,139
To never go back.

81
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,690
There, now.

82
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,250
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,030
This is your home.

84
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,410
Stay here as long as you like,

85
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,240
And leave whenever you want to.

86
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,370
You've got a car, now, too.

87
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,850
You need no ticket now,

88
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,460
Nor is there the fuss of going to the station.

89
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,020
You just have to get in your car and leave.

90
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,260
You're staying here tonight, aren't you?

91
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,450
I'm asking you because if you're staying,

92
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,860
I'll prepare some rice and lentils for you.

93
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,530
You used to enjoy it so much.

94
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,637
Won't you forgive me?

95
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,270
You'll have to, Ruqaiyya Begum.

96
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,820
Give him a nice slap and

97
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:24,690
Settle all scores,

98
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,140
Or I'll be pronouncing a final judgement

99
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,716
And throw him out of the house.

100
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,100
I'll go and see --
-Why would you?

101
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,460
If someone rings the bell,

102
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,060
Would your sister go and see, you blighter?

103
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,260
Get going!

104
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,950
Go!

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,650
I've come to meet your wife.

106
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,180
To congratulate her.

107
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,750
In fact,

108
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,617
Congratulations to you, too!

109
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,250
You've brought a right comely lassie along from Karachi.

110
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,411
Step aside.

111
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,670
Hey, Arifa!

112
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,730
Where are you, mate?

113
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,788
Farah!

114
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,816
Hey!

115
00:10:21,816 --> 00:10:23,057
You've brought flowers!

116
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,780
Would you look at that!

117
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,835
I've brought these for her.

118
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,550
I'd made friends with her in Karachi.

119
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,500
Here.

120
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,180
You do remember, don't you?

121
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,280
Yes.

122
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,510
Then embrace me.

123
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,701
I've come to congratulate you about your engagement.

124
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,400
Peace be upon you.

125
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,290
And upon you, peace.

126
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,440
Uncle Reverend!

127
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,730
Just one prayer has got you hale and hearty!

128
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,820
Do you know what's gotten me hale and hearty?

129
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,040
What?

130
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,877
I've gotten used to hearing 'Uncle Reverend'.

131
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,490
I thought

132
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,906
Who'd call me that over there?

133
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:11,190
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

134
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,770
And upon you, peace.

135
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,030
May you live long.

136
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,020
Please, sit.

137
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,730
I'll sit with my friends.

138
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,740
Alright.

139
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,250
Yes.

140
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,876
Go.

141
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,260
What are you looking at?

142
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,740
She's started a murder spree like you.

143
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,040
She kills

144
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,037
With her mere words.

145
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,970
Alright now, tell me the story.

146
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,878
Who said 'I love you' first?

147
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,090
Nobody did.

148
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,400
He came to me one day,

149
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,841
And said, 'Get engaged to me tomorrow'.

150
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,911
Coffee?

151
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,911
Yes.

152
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,270
Right,

153
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,300
You'd have said yes immediately?

154
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,510
I'd seen it, Jasmine,

155
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,470
I could glimpse him in your eyes.

156
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,651
And I could glimpse him in your eyes.

157
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,260
Well,

158
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,240
I didn't say yes immediately either.

159
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,890
I said, 'Why tomorrow'?

160
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,250
'Why don't you talk about the day after'?

161
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,360
As in, you must've just said it as a nicety, so to speak,

162
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,460
As in,

163
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,060
Just to feed your own ego.

164
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,180
He didn't let any ego remain.

165
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,980
He said, 'Tomorrow means tomorrow'.

166
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,910
'Neither today, nor the day after'.

167
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,250
Why, mate?

168
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,820
May I tell that?

169
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,850
Would you rather conceal it even now?

170
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,850
The Farah who wrote the letters was getting engaged that day.

171
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,810
He wanted to give her a befitting reply.

172
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,800
No --

173
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,367
I was getting engaged that day.

174
00:13:30,866 --> 00:13:36,267
Uncle Reverend had a heart attack at my engagement.

175
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:42,687
What's the matter?

176
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,230
So you write letters to him?

177
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,850
By the Lord, no!

178
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,500
Yes --

179
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,427
Her name's Farah, too.

180
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,840
Initially, everyone here suspected it too,

181
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,236
But I cleared everything up.

182
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,520
What are you looking at?

183
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,627
Nothing.

184
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,247
That's a right coincidence,

185
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,460
Three engagements on the same day.

186
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,020
Wow...

187
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,550
The two of you weren't even acquainted?

188
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,860
The two of us, as in?

189
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,520
You and Afzal.

190
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,940
We were acquainted.

191
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,150
He's Arifa's brother,

192
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,740
Uncle Reverend's son,

193
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,350
And lives in the neighbourhood,

194
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,800
So we were naturally very well acquainted.

195
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,910
Then, who's the one who used to write those letters?

196
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,350
If she was getting engaged that night, why were you getting engaged that night?

197
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,300
What do you mean?

198
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,090
I mean, the real coincidence is that both the girls, except for me,

199
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,330
Getting engaged that night are named Farah.

200
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,830
Would you think about that!

201
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,170
Why were both of them named Farah?

202
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,810
Why should I think about that?

203
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,150
You should.

204
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,218
He's your fiancé, after all!

205
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,720
I'm his fiancée, Farah,

206
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,126
Not his love.

207
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,770
I'd just

208
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,090
Stepped in to give a befitting reply.

209
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,540
There's nothing to worry about.

210
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,810
These lads have loved at least once or twice before they're married.

211
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,010
They might have.

212
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,490
But he's only loved once,

213
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,570
And as long as he lives, he'll only love her.

214
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,490
But then,

215
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,520
Why did you get engaged to him?

216
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,490
I'd fallen for him, Farah.

217
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,900
The allure of his proposal enticed me.

218
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,670
I thought that I deserved at least an engagement to him.

219
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,150
You sound raving mad to me!

220
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,410
You're saying it as if it's not an engagement,

221
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,870
But a temporary arrangement.

222
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,070
The blighter's very handsome.

223
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,250
One would lose one's heart to him easily.

224
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,760
I'm surprised to wonder why you let him come to Karachi in the first place.

225
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,260
I let him?

226
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,080
Never mind,

227
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,630
Let's talk about you.

228
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,630
Don't you think he's handsome?

229
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,230
I do.

230
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,216
But he doesn't belong to my class.

231
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:17,480
He fits in with you nicely.

232
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,230
Why are you laughing?

233
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,520
I'm laughing at how you brought class in.

234
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,500
I'm remembering the day

235
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,600
When you'd come to our place, looking for him.

236
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
Right.

237
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,540
With Dad, right?

238
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,090
'With Dad', so just to speak.

239
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,157
It was you who was looking for him.

240
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,650
I was just having a look at my cupboard.

241
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,570
You were looking through her letters.

242
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,470
Take these and throw them away.

243
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,820
You don't need proofs of your previous love to start anew.

244
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,860
If you burnt these,

245
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:09,586
It'd ease the poor lassie's searing pain.

246
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,200
You're here until Sunday, aren't you?

247
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,460
Yes, perhaps.

248
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,320
Alright, then.

249
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,420
We'll have a ball on Sunday.

250
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,920
What's on Sunday?

251
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,941
I'm getting married.

252
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,290
Hey!

253
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,800
You've not even been engaged yet.

254
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,690
How can you get married?

255
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,480
Ask Uncle Reverend and tell me,

256
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,810
Is it necessary to get engaged before marriage?

257
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,380
No.

258
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,550
I didn't mean that.

259
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm just a bit shocked.

260
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,870
So suddenly, so quickly...

261
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,820
I can't believe it.

262
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,340
But I can believe now;

263
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:15,810
You, too, have decided to give him a befitting reply!

264
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,410
To whom?

265
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,400
That's what nobody can know.

266
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,610
Everyone's giving a befitting reply to someone,

267
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,057
But doesn't tell his name.

268
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,535
I'll take my leave.

269
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,380
You'd come just to tell that?

270
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,520
No --

271
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,790
I'd come to congratulate you.

272
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,587
Would you see that!

273
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:42,240
I forgot it entirely!

274
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,620
Promise me

275
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,130
That you'll stay here until Sunday.

276
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,780
I promise.

277
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,390
I won't go even if someone took me away.

278
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,880
I'll take you along when I go shopping.

279
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,957
Sure.

280
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,030
Mum!

281
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,480
Mum!

282
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,010
Are you listening?

283
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,910
Farah's getting married this Sunday!

284
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,890
Alright.

285
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,366
God be with ye.

286
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,040
Farah's left?

287
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,170
Yes.

288
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,330
What did you say? Who's getting married?

289
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,750
Farah's getting married, Mum.

290
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,970
She's getting married this Sunday.

291
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,470
There's no need to smile so broadly.

292
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,140
Where's Uncle?

293
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,650
He's watching the news.

294
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,140
And where's your sister?

295
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,190
What's her name --?

296
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,170
Farah Ibrahim?

297
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,580
She's in her room.

298
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,650
Then take me straight to her room.

299
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,960
What?

300
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,930
I'll show her today that Sibtain Akhtar Ali is not going to fear any wee lassie out there!

301
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,970
That angry face will be getting a slap.

302
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,660
I'll take it, but will speak my heart out to her face.

303
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,770
Put a sock in it!

304
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,450
As if you've got the guts!

305
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,510
You --

306
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,160
Just tell me where her room is.

307
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,740
The wedding date's been finalised, innit?

308
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,790
The wedding date's been finalised, innit?
-I know all of it.

309
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,680
What would you say, then?

310
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,500
I've thought of ten different ways to decline.

311
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,390
But your Mum and Dad are overjoyed.

312
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,550
To the dickens with Maw and Paw!

313
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,650
Good Lord!

314
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,980
You're furious!

315
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,080
Nobody's seen my fury yet!

316
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,360
You're under my oath,

317
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,746
Show your fury before you leave.

318
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,860
Well, shan, whatever do you want?

319
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,970
There was no danger until the engagement; should I marry her, now?

320
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,450
Have you studied science?

321
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,820
Then understand it clearly -

322
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,680
Marriage is a chemical change.

323
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,317
No inducements can bring the substances back to their original states.

324
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,426
Run!

325
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,560
Get going.

326
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,930
Now that he's here,

327
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,110
He'll be up to more of the same.

328
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,687
He's deliberately aimed his shot.

329
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,430
It's me.

330
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,680
Where are you, Monsieur?

331
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,190
It's been three days and we haven't the foggiest!

332
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm in Hyderabad.

333
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,000
But as per the terms of the deal,

334
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,820
You cannot leave the town without permission.

335
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,500
I just left.

336
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,510
What did you leave?

337
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,740
You and your town.

338
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,490
Are you alright?

339
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,860
I'm alright, sir.

340
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,360
I'm on the streets of my neighbourhood, playing cricket.

341
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,220
Surely,

342
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,960
You're kidding?

343
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,770
I don't know what you understand by 'kidding'.

344
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,540
Look, M. Afzal,

345
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,720
You are needed here.

346
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm being asked where you are and when you'll be coming.

347
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,550
Tell them I'm not coming.

348
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,220
I'll be playing cricket on the streets of my neighbourhood,

349
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,477
And living my life with Mum and Dad.

350
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,910
Where are the letters, Arifa?

351
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,577
Which letters?

352
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,930
The same

353
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,900
That Farah used to write to him.

354
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,590
They're in Afzal's cupboard.

355
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,630
He's kept them safely with him?

356
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,880
Have you read them?

357
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,490
Yes...

358
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,600
Three or four of them.

359
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,675
I will, too.

360
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,180
Don't.

361
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
It is not proper of you to read them.

362
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,130
Why isn't it?

363
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,020
They're not letters, Jasmine,

364
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,060
They're chronicles of love.

365
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,980
Someone else has written them.

366
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,100
So?

367
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,560
Their words will come back to mock you tomorrow if you read them today.

368
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,483
And I will regret it tomorrow, Arifa, if I didn't read them today.

369
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,540
I'll never know how much she loves him.

370
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,380
I just want to see

371
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,770
If she loves him more than I do.

372
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,930
Ask Afzal,

373
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,630
He'd let you read them.

374
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,120
He'd never let me read them.

375
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,447
He'd think that I'd feel sad to read them.

376
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,480
Swear to me, then,

377
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,140
You won't feel sad.

378
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,100
I'm a girl, Arifa.

379
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,210
And girls are the kind who'd beckon to sorrow just like that!

380
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,980
How can I swear to you?

381
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,810
Alright,

382
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,875
I'll test my courage.

383
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,770
Girls should not test their courage.

384
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,210
Don't fear.

385
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,027
Show me the letters.

386
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,600
Over here.

387
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,200
What's the matter?

388
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,220
What is it? Why are you so anxious?

389
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,090
She's in Afzal's room, reading the letters.

390
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,080
'She',

391
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,350
As in Jasmine?

392
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,190
Yes.

393
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,590
She's read them?

394
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,680
My heart says she's reading them.

395
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,130
Oh, so it's your heart that's said it.

396
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,910
The news isn't true, so to speak.

397
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,310
Ruqaiyya Subhanallah is my name.

398
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,890
I can read intentions, Reverend.

399
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:52,710
Alright, you can read intentions...

400
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,770
Then,

401
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,680
Pray tell, what is that

402
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,900
Your Afzal is up to?

403
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,640
What is he up to?

404
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,330
Is he talking about going back?

405
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,470
When did I say he's talking about going back?

406
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,210
You just claimed,

407
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,960
'I can read intentions',

408
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,810
So I thought I'd just as well ask you

409
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,480
What

410
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,500
He would do now.

411
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,450
You're --

412
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,580
You give such a fright, Reverend.

413
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,100
Speaking of which,

414
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,150
Truly, you should fear.

415
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,820
He's only been engaged,

416
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,020
And he's sitting with his fiancée before your eyes in his room.

417
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,750
This

418
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,700
Is not proper.

419
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,000
Which part of it is not proper?

420
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,150
And who's ran into his room with his fiancée?

421
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,570
Fear God, Reverend,

422
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,910
Arifa's with her in the room.

423
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,700
Afzal's gone to meet his friends.

424
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,310
There's no power but God's!

425
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,800
Don't exclaim that,

426
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,830
Go and knock the door,

427
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,410
And

428
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,150
Dissuade her from reading the letters.

429
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,980
By the Lord, lady,

430
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,070
Let her read them.

431
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,490
What's the worst that can happen?

432
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,410
Oh,

433
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,940
You're asking me!

434
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,520
I'd gotten my hands one letter of Fajr's!

435
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,580
I remember it line by line to this day,

436
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,880
Just -- what was that song? What were its lyrics --?

437
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,970
'Uhh -- O you who met my gaze and turned away',

438
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,990
'Uhh -- O you who met my gaze and turned away',
-'I have no complaints from you'.

439
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,000
I have told you a hundred times,

440
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,640
She'd written this rather sheepishly!

441
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,440
Otherwise, unlike your son,

442
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,980
I'm no longer involved in such exchanges of letters! Right?

443
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,330
Who's this Miss Mary?

444
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,450
Miss Mary?

445
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,360
This letter speaks of a certain Miss Mary.

446
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,540
She'd seen Afzal.

447
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,260
Seen, as in?

448
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,359
Outside the school.

449
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,980
Wow!

450
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,260
This is love from good old childhood days, Arifa.

451
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,897
It's been going on since schooldays.

452
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,640
That's enough, put these letters away.

453
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,970
Don't read any further.

454
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,990
Take all the letters except this one.

455
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,870
I'll keep this one with me.

456
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,910
Why?

457
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,540
What'd you do with it?

458
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,230
Just --

459
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,660
It feels as if there's something in this letter.

460
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,210
Don't worry.

461
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm not keeping it forever.

462
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,960
I'll give it back to you in a couple of days.

463
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,590
Where are you going?

464
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,420
To your room.

465
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,150
I'll read it a few times,

466
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,790
Research over it,

467
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,980
And you'll see,

468
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,016
I'll dig up something interesting!

469
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,380
It's not about the elephant, Monseigneur,

470
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,120
But about the scallywag.

471
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,000
He's afraid of sitting on an elephant.

472
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,020
Gone are the days, Monsieur, when grooms would ride an elephant.

473
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,840
Just have him ride a horse.

474
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,310
I said the same to him,

475
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,960
But he flared up at the mention of a horse.

476
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,790
He says,

477
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,310
'I don't trust it'!

478
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,856
'Who knows what it could do if it decided to gallop'!

479
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,196
Let me talk to Madame.

480
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:37,470
Sure, I will.

481
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,387
Here. Talk to him.

482
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:42,506
Hello?

483
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,600
Where's our daughter-in-law?

484
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,210
She's just come back, Monsieur,

485
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:47,740
She'd gone to give her friends

486
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,980
From the University cards for her wedding.

487
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,390
Yes.

488
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,550
That's alright.

489
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,720
Saturday

490
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,800
9 p.m.

491
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
After the news?

492
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,090
Alright, bring the henna.

493
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,425
God be with ye.

494
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,470
What's up with you?

495
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,920
What's up?

496
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,840
It appears you've been traumatised.

497
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,330
You're suddenly all worked up!

498
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,010
Not at all --

499
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,710
No way.

500
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,350
I just -- Thought when I heard of the elephant,

501
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,580
That if he rode an elephant,

502
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,710
Won't it stall all the traffic?

503
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,420
Ah, right.

504
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,300
I'd never thought of that.

505
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,120
Leave it be.

506
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,310
Don't think of it.

507
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,600
Let him ride an elephant if he wishes to.

508
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,460
Whoever cares about the traffic here?

509
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,470
But

510
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:07,380
Why am I anxious, Farah?

511
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,120
What are you anxious about?

512
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,220
Everything's been decided now.

513
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,740
I've agreed, too,

514
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,050
And I'm as firm as a boulder on my intentions.

515
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,980
Why are you anxious, then?

516
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,550
Please, don't be.

517
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,200
I won't step back.

518
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,170
That's the problem!

519
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,540
Problem, as in?

520
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,950
I mean, you won't step back.

521
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,430
What if he stepped back, though?

522
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,430
I have a hunch, Farah,

523
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,760
He'll not be coming.

524
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,000
He'll vanish on the wedding day.

525
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,370
I'm feeling the same.

526
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,470
It must've burnt right through him, this news.

527
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,760
That's what I want, too.

528
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,030
He should burn in agony for one day.

529
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,730
He may vanish, then, if he wants!

530
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,680
Grab his sweet Jasmine's hand quietly,

531
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,370
And leave for Karachi.

532
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:55,910
You're talking about Afzal?

533
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,410
Obviously.

534
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,220
I'm talking about Sibtain Akhtar Ali, Sherlock!

535
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,590
What?

536
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,010
So you think he'll vanish on the wedding day?

537
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,790
Yes.

538
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,510
That's what I feel.

539
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:13,330
Dad will throw him under the elephant's foot and kill him!

540
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,550
Look,

541
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,840
I can't exactly tell you, Farah,

542
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,661
But he doesn't want to marry you.

543
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:22,960
He doesn't want to marry me?

544
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,290
That blighter, the twopenny-halfpenny psychiatrist?

545
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,350
No.

546
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,990
I don't believe this.

547
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,950
He loves me!

548
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,480
He doesn't love you, Farah.

549
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,060
You're saying that

550
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,500
As if you've gotten your hands on his diary,

551
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,710
Or you've caught him red-handed.

552
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,000
Alright, tell me,

553
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,790
If he doesn't love me,

554
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,190
Whom does he love?

555
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,640
Do you, by any chance, fear God at all?

556
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,820
Sibtain's Mum and Dad will be downstairs any moment,

557
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,620
And you're up with this quiz game up here.

558
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,700
Pray tell,

559
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,390
Who loves whom?

560
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,190
Are you talking about Salman Khan?

561
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,270
Or Aamir Khan?

562
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,160
Irrfan Khan.

563
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,150
There!

564
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,140
Now is that too big for his boots!

565
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,830
That twit's into these affaires de cœur!

566
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,880
Anyway,

567
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
You can tell me with whom later.

568
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,330
For now, come downstairs.

569
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,970
This Irrfan Khan is the same, isn't he,

570
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:15,990
Spindly,

571
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,700
Dark-complexioned,

572
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,881
Dark-complexioned, puffy-eyed?

573
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,300
Afzal, just tell me one thing, mate,

574
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,410
Does she no longer write you letters?

575
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,760
I mean,

576
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,240
You haven't read out a new one for seven months.

577
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,280
I've gotten engaged, mate.

578
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,880
She won't write me anything now.

579
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,810
You got engaged just a few days ago.

580
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,690
I'm talking about the time before the engagement.

581
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,620
Leave it, mate.

582
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,960
I've gotten engaged, intentions changed,

583
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,350
Just think that the girl who used to write letters has changed, too.
-The bugger's lying.

584
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,640
You're afraid of Jasmine, aren't you?

585
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,610
Yes.

586
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,130
I'm afraid of everyone who loves me, Babloo.

587
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,670
Very afraid.

588
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,090
This fear has brought me back to Hyderabad.

589
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,240
She loved you too.

590
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,400
Weren't you afraid when getting engaged?

591
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,360
I didn't.

592
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,486
Ask why.

593
00:38:29,486 --> 00:38:32,110
Why?

594
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,920
All fear of her had vanished.

595
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,970
She was getting engaged on the same day.

596
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:43,320
And now, I've heard she's getting married, too.

597
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,690
I'll get going, mate.

598
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,069
The call to the night prayer will be heard any moment.

599
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,630
Everything's alright, innit?

600
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,390
Yes.

601
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,010
Ev --

602
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,200
Everything's alright.

603
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,860
Nothing's alright.

604
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,820
And if something's still alright,

605
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,990
It won't be now.

606
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,020
What happened?

607
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,350
She's reading your letters.

608
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,857
Letters?

609
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,980
Don't ask who gave her.

610
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,970
Can Arifa turn down an order of our daughter-in-law's?

611
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,520
Don't look at her.

612
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,730
Focus your eyes

613
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,170
On what's to come.

614
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,500
She thought she'd just glance over them and put them back in the cupboard,

615
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,820
But I've heard she's reading them as if

616
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,310
Preparing for an exam.

617
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,770
And she's taken such a liking to one of those letters

618
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,450
That she clenched it in her hand and ran away.

619
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,690
She says she'd 'research' over it.

620
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,020
Where is she?

621
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,986
In my room.

622
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,216
Hey!

623
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,990
You don't have the right to go into her room.

624
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,390
She's still an outsider to you.

625
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,640
I won't go into her room, Mum.

626
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,960
I'll knock on the door and say, 'Give the letter back'.

627
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,410
Yes.

628
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,900
That's fine.

629
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,730
But still, take Arifa along.

630
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,260
Come.

631
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,240
And listen,

632
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,560
Request her.

633
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,086
Don't show your anger, okay?

634
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,000
Alright.

635
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
