1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,850
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,117
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:24,224
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:30,630
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,160
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,810
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,403
My good man,

8
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:25,420
Rob us of all our serenity if you want,

9
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,378
But please don't suck the life out of her just yet.

10
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:33,799
Your mother is very helpful to me.

11
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,749
Come here, my dear, why are you embarrassed?

12
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:43,094
Who's the outsider here, whose presence has you petrified?

13
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:45,120
There's good old Lubna,

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,407
And with her,

15
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,467
Sweet Farah.

16
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:51,139
She's come here to listen to all her letters!

17
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,680
You read them out with such evident pleasure!

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,680
And the poor lass cannot even remember what she's been writing to you all along!

19
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,032
Shut the door.

20
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,929
Dad will hear it if I said something.

21
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,552
Who writes you letters?

22
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,364
You are aware, Afzal, that I know how to get you talking.

23
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:01,165
It won't work today.

24
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,725
I will neither place my hand on your head, nor swear.

25
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:08,849
Can you fathom Dad's sorrow?

26
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,870
Mum slaps you and vents it out,

27
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,207
But he no longer slaps.

28
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,878
He's afraid of me.

29
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,600
I've weakened his faith in me.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,553
I've dragged an honest Reverend down from his tribune onto the floor.

31
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,350
So you know all of this?

32
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:36,240
I also know that Mum curses her hands after slapping me.

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,501
Then why don't you correct yourself?

34
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,480
I can't be corrected.

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,930
What do you mean?

36
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,987
You'd pity me if I corrected myself.

37
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,064
I'd have to pass through the same alley her car drives through everyday.

38
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:06,098
Dad would prolong his prayers when I'd go to the Mosque to pray,

39
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:08,419
Afraid, thinking,

40
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:11,927
'He gets involved in a malefaction whenever he prays'.

41
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:15,110
What would you call a malefaction?

42
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,338
My love, too, is like a malefaction.

43
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:22,043
I feel as if I've committed a cardinal sin.

44
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,297
I'm embarrassed before you too.

45
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:30,020
I feel I would die of shame

46
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,296
If she came before my eyes.

47
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,825
Then why don't you tell us who writes you letters?

48
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:40,710
If you love this Farah, why have you kept that Farah's letters?
-I'll tell you one day.

49
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,854
You'd be the first one I'd tell...

50
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:48,179
This last bit gets me suspicious,

51
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:52,680
And I'm also afraid to say that she's told a lie.

52
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:57,321
I swear by you she's told the truth.

53
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,012
She hasn't written these letters.

54
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,026
Pray tell, my dear,

55
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:31,416
Do I beg forgiveness

56
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,666
On his behalf,

57
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,541
Or ask his mother to?

58
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,460
Farah...

59
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:57,639
You're feeling sorrow now, aren't you?

60
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,253
Yes...

61
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:01,515
Perhaps it's sorrow...

62
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,656
Why were you weeping on the way back?

63
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,592
I wasn't weeping.

64
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,999
I just got a bit teary-eyed.

65
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:12,170
You're pitying him, innit?

66
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,500
I'm pitying the Reverend.

67
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,934
He loves him so much.

68
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,835
Hey!

69
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,562
It's still here.

70
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,000
Haven't you sent it for repairing?

71
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:32,180
Talk about him.

72
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't even think of him.

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,960
But, seeing his family, it seems

74
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,450
He's not that bad.

75
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,360
Did you see the tears in his eyes?

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,170
I did.

77
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,580
But why did he tear up?

78
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,340
Does one cry when one's ashamed of what he's done?

79
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,910
He wasn't ashamed.

80
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,660
Not at all.

81
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,760
That's what I felt, too.

82
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,534
He stood there firmly

83
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:59,427
As if he's been wronged!

84
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,628
What nerve

85
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,550
For a trickster

86
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,254
And a con man!

87
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,910
Alright, now, forget about him.

88
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,378
Who's crazy enough to remember him?

89
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:11,083
The Reverend is coming to my mind every now and then.

90
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,894
He can't live without him.

91
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:14,395
Why would he?

92
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:17,330
He'd forget, as would he, all that happened in a few days.

93
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,868
He [Afzal] won't forget.

94
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:21,664
He'd remember every single thing.

95
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,085
He'd be afraid

96
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:26,573
That he may have to face me.

97
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:27,506
So?

98
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,350
What difference does that make?

99
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,928
It doesn't to me.

100
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,678
But it does to the Reverend.

101
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:36,601
He'd [Afzal] leave Hyderabad.

102
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,350
Who told you?

103
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,648
My heart says it.

104
00:07:39,648 --> 00:07:40,787
Shut up, Farah!

105
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:43,909
You've suffered the consequences of your heart's augury many times before

106
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,784
And you are suffering to this day.

107
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:48,393
I'm honest, Lubna,

108
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:50,692
He won't say in Hyderabad.

109
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,471
He'd leave everyone.

110
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,133
And what if he didn't?

111
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,072
You may proclaim it

112
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:01,712
That the greatest of all fabulists is Farah's heart.

113
00:08:01,712 --> 00:08:04,056
An ace fabulist.

114
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,440
When does it depart?

115
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,459
3.15.

116
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:21,756
Get to the Mosque with a bike by 2.30.

117
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:23,208
Think over it, Afzal,

118
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,553
Think over it once more.

119
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:28,098
There's no further scope for thinking.

120
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:30,553
I don't know where you've picked this 'scope' from!

121
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,370
Now there's 'no scope' for anything to you!

122
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,661
Hey, I can't have a long conversation.

123
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:39,163
It'd be trouble if Arifa overheard it.

124
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,221
Alright.

125
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,049
I'll be there on time.

126
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,962
And keep the money in your pocket.

127
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:50,493
Give it to me at the station.

128
00:08:50,682 --> 00:08:52,395
I've kept it.

129
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,411
I'm wandering about with the money in my pocket.

130
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,195
Okay, bye.

131
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,292
Bye.

132
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,341
You're awake?

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,572
Yes.

134
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,734
Why?

135
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
He hasn't offered his prayers.

136
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,731
He'd said he had,

137
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:37,215
So he must have.

138
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,086
Arifa told me

139
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,439
That he was lying.

140
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,909
God forgive!

141
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,830
I'll scold him in the morning.

142
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,184
At the very least, he should not lie about his prayers!

143
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,252
There are some sleeping pills in the drawer.

144
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:06,750
I'd brought an extra 5mg.

145
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,584
Take one.

146
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,736
It'll ease your woes.

147
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,048
I've taken one already.

148
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:18,017
Neither has it eased my woes, nor put me to sleep.

149
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,986
You couldn't sleep either?

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,435
How strange, isn't it, Ruqaiyya, that I've

151
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:35,048
Never stayed awake like this even for your sorrow.

152
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,311
When have I given you any sorrow?

153
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,935
What was it, if not sorrow,

154
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:43,013
Four years until the engagement, and four years and three months of separation,

155
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,675
Then, your Dad's order,

156
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:47,364
'Subhanallah, if you'

157
00:11:47,364 --> 00:11:52,313
'So much as pass through this alley, consider the engagement broken'!

158
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,550
I'd bought one of those

159
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,543
Little tape recorders back then.

160
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,633
In the quiet of the night,

161
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,867
I'd secretly listen to one song.

162
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,124
Which one?

163
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:25,780
<i>Where art thou; call out to me,</i>

164
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:34,004
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

165
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:41,429
<i>Call out to me, O where art thou;</i>

166
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:48,560
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

167
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,760
<i>I lie here, wasted,</i>

168
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:04,430
<i>Where dost thou thrive?</i>

169
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,212
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

170
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,603
Alright, now, that's enough.

171
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,917
I'm feeling sleepy.

172
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,912
You'd better get some rest too.

173
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,709
Thank you.

174
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,697
She'll be completing her Master's in a month,

175
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,590
Send her to pursue her MPhil now.

176
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,586
Has she said this?

177
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:23,967
I've thought of this.

178
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:26,080
That's brilliant.

179
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,630
Who knows how many years she'll take to earn her MPhil?

180
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,890
Won't she get married?

181
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,493
Who will she marry?

182
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,631
We'll look for a suitable boy.

183
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,766
Let me be very clear, Irsa Begum, that I'm not sending the lass to London all alone.

184
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,789
The pursuit of knowledge is dear to me, too,

185
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:43,337
But honour is dearer to me.

186
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,870
She won't agree to any one, Monseigneur.

187
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,867
Why won't she?

188
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,976
Are there no good lads left in the world?

189
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,492
She'll definitely like someone.

190
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,321
She won't like anyone. Not now.

191
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:57,328
She'll take a few years to conclude

192
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:00,598
That nobody can possibly be better than Afzal.

193
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:03,011
Let her go.

194
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:04,683
She's no longer alone.

195
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:07,203
When a girl starts thinking about someone,

196
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:10,046
She's no longer alone.

197
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,652
So what says your augurer of a heart?

198
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:33,089
When will he leave?

199
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,576
Tonight.

200
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,826
Who knows when he'll return to Hyderabad...

201
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:43,440
If what you say turns out to be true,

202
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,906
I swear I'll have you perform exorcism

203
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:49,030
And make me amulets all my life.

204
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,794
Call Arifa in a while and ask her

205
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:55,046
Where her brother is.

206
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:58,192
She'll say that he's in his room, sleeping.

207
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,685
Say, then,

208
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,920
'Go and check'.

209
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:04,907
She'd find out, as would you,

210
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:07,830
When she'd check.

211
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,438
What's the time?

212
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,915
2.20.

213
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,111
He'd be about to leave.

214
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,742
Call and ask at a quarter to three.

215
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,637
She'll check and tell you that he's left.

216
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,066
Get going.

217
00:21:55,737 --> 00:21:57,630
Didn't I tell you to get a move on?

218
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,228
There's no scope for stopping to look back.

219
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:01,980
C'mon.

220
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,032
What's the time?

221
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,135
It's almost 3.

222
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,821
Call Arifa.

223
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:56,357
Call her, will you?

224
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:59,670
Ask her where her brother is.

225
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,522
Call her; I'm being honest!

226
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:04,868
He's left.

227
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,616
Hello?

228
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:34,520
Lubna here.

229
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,301
Everything's alright, isn't it?

230
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,880
It is over here,

231
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,970
Check and tell me if everything's alright there.

232
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,524
Yes, everything's alright.

233
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,380
Where's Afzal?

234
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,285
In his room?

235
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,261
Go and check,

236
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,699
See if he's actually in his room, sleeping.

237
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,060
What do you mean?

238
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
I'll tell you what I mean later.

239
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,714
For now, stay on the line, go to his room, and tell me if he's there.

240
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,810
Afzal!

241
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,847
Afzal?

242
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,973
Afzal!

243
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,730
He --

244
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,999
He's not in his room, Lubna.

245
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:37,894
He's gone, Arifa.

246
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,470
He's left Hyderabad.

247
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,396
Who told you?

248
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,717
Farah.

249
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:50,205
Has he told Farah?

250
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,404
Farah's heart has told her.

251
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,785
Thank you, mate.

252
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:38,800
My train's here.

253
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,065
You may go now.

254
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,861
Afzal,

255
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,564
If you can somehow see some scope for it on the way, turn back, will you?

256
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:55,942
Please.

257
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,173
If you're vexed with someone, leave it be.

258
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:01,431
If you're obdurate, don't be.

259
00:27:01,431 --> 00:27:04,350
I'm vexed with myself,

260
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,700
Obdurate against fate.

261
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,179
I'll die

262
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:11,980
Of disgrace here;

263
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,050
If forced to return,

264
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,447
I'd rather drown in the ocean.

265
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,580
As they say,

266
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,982
The waters of shame are deeper than the oceans.

267
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,242
You are awake

268
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:51,100
And having tea.

269
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,354
What is going on?

270
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,745
Why don't you have some, too?

271
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:57,776
Sit.

272
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:00,719
Take two or three sips first.

273
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,440
As you command.

274
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,740
God is the Greatest.

275
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,279
May you live long.

276
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,857
That's three sips there.

277
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:44,968
Tell me, now.

278
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,000
Mum's asleep, right?

279
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,824
Fast asleep.

280
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:57,776
The biddy's taken a stronger dose than 5mg.

281
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:01,778
She'll wake up just in time to make up for missed prayers!

282
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:05,177
That's very good.

283
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,980
Why is it good?

284
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,064
Here.

285
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,422
Afzal's written it?

286
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:32,177
Yes.

287
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,846
He's left?

288
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,654
Just one blighter

289
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:30,062
Among one's sons

290
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:33,826
Can kill; that scallywag!

291
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,453
You --

292
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:56,586
He had some money with him, didn't he?

293
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,016
Well, no worries about that.

294
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:04,855
As per his last known whereabouts,

295
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,949
He was playing a cricket match at night.

296
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:10,042
Let's just say

297
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,500
That, as he left,

298
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,555
He's gambled there, too.

299
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,082
She's sleeping without a worry.

300
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:15,234
The pill's got the power!

301
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:19,780
The wretch can even make a mother doze off like that!

302
00:33:21,062 --> 00:33:24,312
But you'd better stay awake.

303
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,970
I'll lead the prayers

304
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,980
And think about a solution for when she's awake.

305
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,290
Keep a close watch.

306
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,045
If she wakes up,

307
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:38,606
Don't tell her what roused you.

308
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,803
<i>Who were those people</i>

309
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:08,103
<i>Who won their love?</i>

310
00:34:08,103 --> 00:34:13,978
<i>Who were those people</i>

311
00:34:13,978 --> 00:34:19,270
<i>Who won their love?</i>

312
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,410
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

313
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:30,800
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

314
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,327
<i>Who were those people</i>

315
00:34:36,327 --> 00:34:40,450
<i>Who won their love?</i>

316
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:44,299
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

317
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,895
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

318
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:49,504
If necessary, you'd stand firm before Dad in saying,

319
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,819
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

320
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,835
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!
<i>Every compeer I found</i>

321
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:57,786
<i>Every compeer I found</i>

322
00:34:57,786 --> 00:34:58,941
<i>Doubled my heart's grief</i>

323
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,970
<i>Doubled my heart's grief</i>
Just keep on loving me,

324
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,050
<i>Doubled my heart's grief</i>
So much

325
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:03,360
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>
So much

326
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,256
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>
That beholders and earwiggers

327
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:07,400
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>
Die of envy!

328
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,110
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

329
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,490
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

330
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,688
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>
Must I be perfidious?

331
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,090
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>
There's no other option!

332
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,154
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>
We may just be parted...

333
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,659
<i>Who were those people</i>
We may just be parted...

334
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:20,098
<i>Who were those people</i>

335
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:25,295
<i>Who won their love?</i>

336
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,623
Hey!

337
00:35:35,623 --> 00:35:36,550
Oi!

338
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,933
Get your leg out of the way!

339
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,200
Ych a fi!

340
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,387
Would you look at that, Mam!

341
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:44,931
How he's staring back!

342
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,006
Push him aside!

343
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:47,200
Get aside!

344
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,184
Look at him staring wide-eyed!

345
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,843
It's you, Reverend!

346
00:36:44,843 --> 00:36:46,052
And upon you, peace.

347
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:47,596
You'll have to come.

348
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,079
Right now?

349
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,014
Yes.

350
00:36:50,014 --> 00:36:51,176
What happened?

351
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,020
Come along, will you?

352
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,250
I'll be coming in a minute.

353
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,128
Listen, Doctor...

354
00:36:56,128 --> 00:36:59,291
Bring all the heart medicines you have.

355
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,564
Has someone had a heart attack?

356
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:03,049
God forbid, no!

357
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:05,580
Just do as I say.

358
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,722
Alright, I'm coming.

359
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,912
O Lord, grant me peace...

360
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,344
Arifa!

361
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,047
Arifa!

362
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,366
Yes, Mum?

363
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:44,068
You darted here so quickly!

364
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:47,010
Have I never called out to you before?

365
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,636
Anyway,

366
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:49,822
Where's your Dad?

367
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:51,131
He'll be coming shortly.

368
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:53,660
He would be, but where's he gone?

369
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,029
His prayers would've ended at 5.15.

370
00:37:57,268 --> 00:37:59,870
Anyway,

371
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,210
What about your brother?

372
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,059
Has he asked for some tea or breakfast?

373
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,780
Or does he lay shamefaced, sleeping?

374
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:12,940
Who can fall asleep shamefaced?

375
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,920
The poor soul must be awake.

376
00:38:17,905 --> 00:38:20,400
May my hands break.

377
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,240
I'd hit him so hard.

378
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,972
His jaw must be paining.

379
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,694
Ask him how he is.

380
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:32,895
Give the poor lad something to eat and tell him to get some sleep.

381
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,836
What would you like to have?

382
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:48,053
Tea or coffee?

383
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,382
Don't ask about tea or coffee in an emergency,

384
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:52,489
Just bring the patient, Reverend.

385
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:53,740
Dad...

386
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,908
She's up.

387
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:58,484
She's only asking about him ever since she got up.

388
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,163
Sit firm here, Doctor.

389
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:04,365
Keep the medicines ready.

390
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,168
Medicines for what -- I should know first...

391
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,089
Have some tea.

392
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:14,984
I'll get you some in a minute.

393
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,463
Who's the honourable visitor?

394
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:34,712
He's

395
00:39:34,712 --> 00:39:36,794
The good old Doctor.

396
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,040
The Doctor?

397
00:39:39,665 --> 00:39:42,212
You're mentioning him as if

398
00:39:42,212 --> 00:39:46,275
Mentioning him forebodes no danger.

399
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:49,555
Now that he's here, serve him some tea before he leaves.

400
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,132
Else, the folks in the neighbourhood will keep on asking until the night,

401
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:53,398
'Is everything alright'?

402
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:54,522
'What happened'?

403
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:59,273
'Who's so sick that you had to call the Doctor home'?
-Would you please shut up, Ruqaiyya Begum?

404
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:02,444
Going on and on for no reason!

405
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,915
The door's shut, isn't it?

406
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:08,353
Not a sound goes out of this room when this door is shut.

407
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:12,080
Don't you remember when I'd gone to watch a film with Nüzhet?

408
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,410
We had a row in this very room.

409
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,286
How ferociously you roared!

410
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:20,882
But not a mouse stirred outside!

411
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:22,461
May I sit?

412
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,133
There, now.

413
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:26,680
You'd ask permission of me to sit now?

414
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,539
And why would you sit?

415
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:33,040
Have forgotten the good Doctor sitting out there?

416
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:34,861
My Afzal!

417
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,549
He's alright, isn't he?

418
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:38,846
Yes, he's --

419
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:40,721
He's alright.

420
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:42,268
Sit down.

421
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:44,299
Sit...

422
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,586
If...

423
00:40:48,586 --> 00:40:52,600
If you are tormented like this,

424
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,390
It'd make things difficult for me.

425
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,853
This lordly wont of yours of whacking him,

426
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:04,291
Get this out of yourself!

427
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:07,611
Your son's a young man.

428
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:09,970
And he's --

429
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,692
Out of control, at that.

430
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:14,610
What if, one of these days,

431
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,296
He went astray?

432
00:41:16,296 --> 00:41:17,899
So?

433
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,806
You've forgotten already!

434
00:41:20,806 --> 00:41:22,149
He threatens us

435
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,871
With his departure

436
00:41:23,871 --> 00:41:25,852
From here!

437
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:28,137
Should I yield to his threats?

438
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:30,104
It won't be this way, Reverend,

439
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,280
If he does something wrong,

440
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,510
I'll whack him.

441
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,290
Alright, then, don't budge!

442
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,020
But remember, also,

443
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,950
That it won't be like this every time.

444
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,343
One of these days, you'll wake up

445
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:48,000
To the news that he's boarded the 3.15 a.m. train and left!

446
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
