1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,830
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,140
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,250
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,590
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,870
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,762
Peace be upon you, Mum.

8
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,002
What happened to her?

9
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,009
Why was she so furious?

10
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:42,955
She's coming after insulting him!

11
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:44,520
Who?

12
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:47,187
The same Afzal.

13
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:49,987
Came across him a few times,

14
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:51,757
And it got into her head.

15
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:53,749
She's said such things

16
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:56,989
As only God can forgive her for!

17
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,784
Hey...

18
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,844
I did the right thing, right?

19
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,199
In a way, you did.

20
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,424
But you did it too early.

21
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:32,781
If I didn't do it early,

22
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,877
The blighter would've besmirched my name in the entire neighbourhood!

23
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,784
Those who can listen to abuses quietly

24
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,023
Never besmirch others' names.

25
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,892
You've besmirched his name,

26
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:44,692
And along with him, you've besmirched your own name.

27
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:48,329
It occurred to me last night that I should call Arifa and ask her to tell him

28
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:51,316
Not to show himself before Farah.

29
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,664
But you...

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,263
Well,

31
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,048
What's done is done.

32
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,217
You bugger!

33
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,390
That'd be your fourth cigarette!

34
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,008
You've been telling me for two years

35
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,441
And now you'd die out of grief over a girl?

36
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,459
I'm in dire straits, Sajid.

37
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:29,410
I was in dire straits too.

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,921
Back then, <i>you</i> used to pull my leg.

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,358
Hyderabad can no longer nurture my life

40
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:42,919
But my Mum won't let me leave.

41
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,113
Where would you go?

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,778
Karachi.

43
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,687
To whom?

44
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,020
To Karachiites.

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,128
And what's your reason for going?

46
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:02,623
My conscience asks me to go.

47
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,258
Then why are you asking your Mum?

48
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:05,965
Go.

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,934
I will, Sajid.

50
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:12,541
If only someone told me

51
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:16,331
Which of my mother and my conscience is the greater.

52
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,843
Why don't you tell him?

53
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:41,495
The mother is always the greater one!

54
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,599
He'd only take his mother's word on that.

55
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,703
If she's the one who wrote those letters, who was the one who meted out such humiliation that night?

56
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:07,639
That's what I can't quite understand.

57
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,413
I'm thinking of meeting her one of these days

58
00:05:10,413 --> 00:05:13,358
And asking her the true story.

59
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,440
Perhaps the two of them have had some differences.

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,122
Or perhaps it's that she does not love him anymore?

61
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:24,064
Why, then, was she talking about 800,000 and some deal?

62
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,720
She said she'd hired him for 200,000 a month

63
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,433
To 'love' her for four months.

64
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,617
That part about four months is a white lie.

65
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,212
She's been writing him letters for years!

66
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:35,397
Since the days she must be doing her GCSEs!

67
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:38,545
Ah, the pastimes of opulent demoiselles!

68
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,405
A letter to one,

69
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,950
A call to another...

70
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,646
She's not the type!

71
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:46,186
She's an honest type of girl!

72
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:48,716
A bit apprehensive and skittish,

73
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,601
One who saves herself from the evil gaze.

74
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,313
She's neither snappish, nor conceited.

75
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,204
If you sit with her, it feels like you're with an old friend.

76
00:05:57,204 --> 00:06:00,578
She'd seize your hand and stop you as you're leaving.

77
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:03,565
I'd only seen her love,

78
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:07,326
This is the first time I've seen her despise someone.

79
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:14,478
Lubna's calling.

80
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,721
Hello?

81
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,637
It's Lubna.

82
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:28,569
I know.

83
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,713
What were you doing?

84
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:32,327
I was sitting with Mum.

85
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,675
She's stitching me a shirt.

86
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,452
Where are you now?

87
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,773
In my room.

88
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,267
And where's your brother?

89
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,679
He's not at home.

90
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:43,146
Have you ever asked him where he goes?

91
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,336
No.

92
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,947
Nobody asks him such questions.

93
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,186
Oh...

94
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:50,208
So you've given him free rein.

95
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,194
Lubna,

96
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,789
I know my brother just as well as you know your sister.

97
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,004
I've never called to say to you,

98
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:59,270
'So you've given Farah free rein'.

99
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,286
Arifa,

100
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,796
You're getting angry because you don't know the truth.

101
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,564
And you're saying all of this because you don't know the truth either.

102
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:08,358
I called to tell you something, mate.

103
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,629
It seems you were just itching to pick a quarrel!

104
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:12,788
Go on.

105
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:15,695
He stands in our way as we go to University in the morning

106
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:16,964
As he does

107
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:19,138
When we're coming back.

108
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:19,972
So what?

109
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,693
What 'so'?

110
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:21,913
This isn't something good.

111
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:24,596
Many more boys can be found standing on roads and in alleyways.

112
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,578
I suppose you call to tell their sisters too?

113
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:27,627
Please, Arifa,

114
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:30,153
Farah is mad with rage over it.

115
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:32,777
Tell her to buy the entire neighbourhood if she can!

116
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,893
Watch how you're talking!

117
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:38,764
I will talk like this, Lubna, if you talk about my brother this way.

118
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,485
Do you know what happened today?

119
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:41,520
Something's happened?

120
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,853
He was standing in our way,

121
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:43,843
And Farah saw him.

122
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:47,815
Stopped the car, got out, and humiliated him before everyone!

123
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,258
Are you listening?

124
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:51,160
I've just called to tell you

125
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,370
To stop him.

126
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,818
Next time, she'd slap him on his face!

127
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:57,601
Then tell Farah to be afraid!

128
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,481
I'm going to break her face!

129
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:01,473
Are you listening?

130
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:02,986
You might as well hear this:

131
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:06,035
If my brother's quietly taken all that insult,

132
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,877
Tell Farah she'll get a befitting reply to it.

133
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:09,922
I will talk to her

134
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,836
On that very street and alleyway!

135
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:13,079
Are you mad?

136
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,586
Are you touched in the head?

137
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:15,862
Give the phone to her!

138
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,749
I want to talk to the blighter!

139
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,886
Let me see her snobbery over her father's riches!

140
00:08:20,886 --> 00:08:22,684
Give the phone to her, will you?

141
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,990
Tell the peeress to try something like this again if she's got the courage!

142
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,209
Leave a slap,

143
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,537
I dare her to talk to Afzal with so much as her voice raised!

144
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,294
I swear by my father, I'd rip her apart!

145
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:34,656
He'll be standing right there in the morning,

146
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:35,876
Tell her to stop the car,

147
00:08:35,876 --> 00:08:37,105
And come out!

148
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:38,701
I swear by God,

149
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:43,710
I'm not Reverend Subhanallah's daughter if I did not cut her down to her puny size!

150
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,649
Peace be upon you.

151
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,548
And upon you.

152
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,955
She was alright just now...

153
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,735
Her friend called her, and

154
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:33,280
She dashed upstairs.

155
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,491
'<i>Her friend</i> called her'!

156
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:39,570
Put it plainly that Lubna called her.

157
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,480
She will only give such expressions when she'd call her.

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,865
Mum!

159
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,304
I'm going to Lubna's!

160
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,458
She's taken after you.

161
00:09:55,458 --> 00:10:01,984
One can't tell whether you're just letting me know or asking for permission when you leave for somewhere!

162
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,035
Don't ask for your 98,000 now.

163
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:05,189
I've quit gambling.

164
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,508
I'm a bit skint these days.

165
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,640
Talk to the old colony lads.

166
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,412
We're playing a match tonight.

167
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,670
You must be itching to play some cricket...

168
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,784
You must be itching to play some cricket... Innit?

169
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:20,399
No.

170
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,451
I've got an itch to gamble.

171
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,646
Put a sock in it!

172
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,953
You don't believe me, do you?

173
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,359
You think like my Dad that I've corrected my ways?

174
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,016
I haven't corrected my ways, mate.

175
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:39,560
Not one bit! I'm my same old self.

176
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,606
A gambler.

177
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,159
I swore an oath,

178
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,311
Made promises,

179
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:48,140
But kept on playing.

180
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,188
The thing is, I've badly lost a big gamble.

181
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:53,626
I have not a penny

182
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,765
In my heart, mind, or pocket.

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,557
I've lost everything, mate.

184
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,920
Just talk to the old colony lads.

185
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,350
Tell them we're playing for 100,000.

186
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,550
We're playing the match today, Babloo.

187
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,283
I don't have any money.

188
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:11,584
And what if you lost?

189
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,860
Put a sock in it!

190
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,723
I lost to someone else.

191
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:20,277
I never played to win there in the first place.

192
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,208
Alright, talk to them and call me.

193
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,419
I'll give the buggers a proper beating!

194
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,949
Call her!

195
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,330
Get me through to her!

196
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,687
Let me see, too, how she talks!

197
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,581
Splendid,

198
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:54,783
Instead of being ashamed of what her brother did

199
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:56,560
And asking forgiveness of me,

200
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,910
She's showing me such arrogance!

201
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,980
I'm saying call her!

202
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,894
To the dickens with her!

203
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,830
To the dickens with you, too!

204
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,821
If you know how to create a scene on the road,

205
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:17,312
I know how to barge in and take on the likes of you!

206
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:18,973
What's this, Arifa?

207
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:20,762
Sit down and talk calmly.

208
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:23,433
Sit down my foot!

209
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:28,455
I consider it my insult to set foot in the house of the haughty!

210
00:13:28,455 --> 00:13:32,855
It was her depravity that compelled me to come here to give a befitting reply,

211
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:36,684
Else, I would not even spit at your doorstep!

212
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,340
Look, you're being insolent there!

213
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,600
If I uttered something, it'd inflame you!

214
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,835
Shut up, Farah.

215
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,370
She's come to our home.

216
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,141
Is there anything left for you to inflame?

217
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:51,957
Or do you think that you can don this knavish veil and be hailed as virtuous?

218
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,497
You're not virtuous.

219
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:59,709
Behind your innocent face, you conceal the disgustful truth of your character!

220
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,050
Your family may be nescient but I'm not.

221
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,890
I know everything,

222
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,612
As does he

223
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:11,509
The one you've humiliated in broad daylight.

224
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:16,400
He listened to every bit of your bosh quietly because he's Reverend Subhanallah's son.

225
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,435
Don't take this for his poltroonery;

226
00:14:19,435 --> 00:14:21,004
Such is his upbringing,

227
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:23,060
Farah Ibrahim.

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,807
Whether a woman is one like yourself or like one

229
00:14:28,807 --> 00:14:30,780
Miss Rosy from your office,

230
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,473
He's been taught to respect her at any cost.

231
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,395
Look, Arifa,

232
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:37,780
This is not proper.

233
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,280
If she's made a mistake,

234
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,860
Talk to her calmly.

235
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,528
Too much has been said already for me to talk calmly now.

236
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:47,758
The only thing left, now, is a confrontation.

237
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:50,390
I'll meet you in the same alleyway tomorrow morning.

238
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,930
My brother will be with me.

239
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,466
Get out of your car and walk up to him if you dare,

240
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:59,951
And if I fail to make your disgustful reality show up on your face,

241
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:02,419
I'd change my name!

242
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,583
That's enough, Arifa.

243
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,899
If you cannot talk calmly, you may show yourself out.

244
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,206
I'm leaving, my dear.

245
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,990
But let me just

246
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,536
Hold a mirror up to her as I leave...

247
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,714
Here

248
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:25,005
Are four letters for you to read.

249
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:30,650
There are over a hundred in my brother's cupboard.

250
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:34,510
Reading these would

251
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,702
Tear the curtain of her virtuousness that's been pulled over your eyes.

252
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,445
<i>She</i> is the one

253
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,951
Who used to write letters to my brother.

254
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,846
Sorry, Aunt,

255
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:36,534
But I had no other option.

256
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,128
Do you have these memorised by heart or do I need to read them out?

257
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,190
Farah!

258
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,248
May the Lord reward you [for this favour].

259
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,900
Peace be upon you.

260
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,897
Hey!

261
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:42,483
You're back already?

262
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,519
Didn't she serve you tea or something?

263
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,840
I needed just so much time to do what I had to.

264
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,138
And you know just as well

265
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,617
That theirs is not a place where we can have tea.

266
00:17:53,617 --> 00:17:56,663
I'm going to offer my afternoon prayers.

267
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,745
What did you have to do?

268
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,617
There is still time for the afternoon prayer.

269
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,365
Would you say something only when your Dad asks or would you give me the honour?

270
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,722
Farah had misbehaved with him.

271
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:17,865
I'd gone to give her a befitting reply.

272
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:50,050
Why did she misbehave?

273
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,413
She thought Afzal stands in her way as she goes to and comes back from the University.

274
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,146
Is there any bit of truth in this?

275
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,060
Well, he's surely been going somewhere for the last two days...

276
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,769
There are bits of truth in a lot more, Mum.

277
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,214
She'd concealed some, and we'd concealed others.

278
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:11,290
Everything's come out in the open today.
-What have <i>you</i> done?

279
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,977
Shoved her letters in her face

280
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:17,122
And said that I'd have her answer for this latest insult.

281
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,901
What a silly girl!

282
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:23,098
She lives in a glass house and throws stones at lovers.

283
00:19:23,098 --> 00:19:24,860
Get it straight, Mademoiselle,

284
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,193
Even if Afzal loves you,

285
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:30,363
We are not bound by his love.

286
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:34,194
Our intentions may change any minute.

287
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,952
Look, Afzal,

288
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:51,496
I've talked about the match,

289
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,762
But I've only got 1,500 Rupees.

290
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:54,904
That's enough.

291
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,956
Keep it safe in your pocket.

292
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:59,344
What about the remaining 98,500?

293
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:00,527
What for?

294
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:01,426
You bugger!

295
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,804
We'd have to give 100,000 in cash if we lost the match!

296
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,253
Spit in my face if I lose.

297
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:07,614
I've told you,

298
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,687
There's no chance of losing, Babloo.

299
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,606
Hey!

300
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:11,840
Watch those big words.

301
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,660
Remember,

302
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,830
It only takes one ball to get bowled.

303
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,690
Be positive, mate.

304
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,987
Think how long it takes to not get bowled.

305
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,665
Tell me the time.

306
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,109
8 p.m. sharp.

307
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,338
Get ready.

308
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:31,888
I'll be there at 8.

309
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,097
That was all it was.

310
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,160
Lie down, dear.

311
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,953
Come with me.

312
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,052
Where's she going?

313
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,421
She's fine, doctor.

314
00:21:20,157 --> 00:21:22,174
She had to go somewhere.

315
00:21:22,174 --> 00:21:23,638
She's late.

316
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:27,813
As you wish, but she's not completely fine right now.

317
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:31,338
She will be in a while.

318
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,501
Come, doctor.

319
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,749
Where to?

320
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,163
Tell him.

321
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,373
Where?

322
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:49,374
Why, Arifa's!

323
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,349
Turn right.

324
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,367
Where's she gone?

325
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,727
To Afzal's.

326
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:18,454
Why?

327
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:22,520
She came across him on her way and insulted him.

328
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,930
Arifa came here and put her right in her senses when she found out.

329
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,115
She must've gone to apologise.

330
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,944
Who's Arifa?

331
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:32,989
Afzal's sister.

332
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:34,825
She'll have to admit it one day, Irsa,

333
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,754
That he's very virtuous.

334
00:22:37,754 --> 00:22:41,159
My impression can never be off.

335
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:44,000
God is the Greatest...

336
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:20,147
Rush to your success...

337
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:28,610
God is the Greatest...

338
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:38,137
For there is none but Him.

339
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,300
Sit.

340
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,260
Don't worry.

341
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,995
There's nobody here except the two of us.

342
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:09,752
Would you like some tea or coffee?

343
00:25:09,752 --> 00:25:12,815
We also have coffee at our place.

344
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,299
No, thank you.

345
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,367
Do you want to check the cups and dishes?

346
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,231
They're clean.

347
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:18,410
They've been washed.

348
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,417
Please, Arifa, sit.

349
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,759
I want to talk to you.

350
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,310
You will not say one word against my brother.

351
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,352
I will neither listen nor let you speak.

352
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,416
I will forget that you've come to our house.

353
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,823
I promise

354
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:33,033
I won't say a word against your brother.

355
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,339
I've just come to explain my side of the story

356
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,697
And I hope you'd believe everything I have to say.

357
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,972
I can't guarantee that.

358
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:48,644
Alright.

359
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:51,346
I have a way out.

360
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:54,668
Get the Qur'an and keep it here.

361
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,141
I'm ritually pure

362
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:58,589
And have come to swear on oath.

363
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,265
If you don't believe my purity,

364
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:02,680
I can purify myself before you.

365
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,858
Alright.

366
00:26:03,858 --> 00:26:05,657
Go on.

367
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:06,926
No.

368
00:26:06,926 --> 00:26:08,156
Bring the Qur'an.

369
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:11,665
I will say everything as an oath on the Qur'an.

370
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,484
No, my dear.

371
00:26:16,484 --> 00:26:18,030
Go on.

372
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,460
I trust everything you have to say.

373
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:51,550
I solemnly swear with the Lord as my witness

374
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,050
That I've never written any letter to Afzal.

375
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,703
All these letters are false.

376
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,190
Or the Farah in these letters

377
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,870
Is someone else...

378
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,901
I've only seen Afzal passing by

379
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,505
About three or four times in my lifetime.

380
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,570
Or heard from the maid or Lubna

381
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,645
That Afzal is Arifa's brother.

382
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,660
I met him for the first time in my life

383
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,410
In her presence at the restaurant,

384
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,264
Where we decided he'd --

385
00:27:24,264 --> 00:27:26,463
Feign love for me for four months,

386
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:29,219
For which I'd pay him 800,000 Rupees.

387
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:29,988
I mean

388
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:32,010
200,000 a month.

389
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,254
This, too, happened because of her

390
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:36,408
Because she'd wanted to help him

391
00:27:36,408 --> 00:27:39,150
As he had been ousted an innocent and was out of work.

392
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,788
She thought it'd earn him some.

393
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,231
And

394
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:46,130
If he's ever met me during this period,

395
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:51,382
Or paid a visit to meet Mum and Dad, it was all a part of his job.

396
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:53,770
I was able to get rid of the one

397
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:56,360
I was getting married off to,

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,770
But if Mum and Dad

399
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,849
Found Afzal suitable in these meetings,

400
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,505
What's my fault?

401
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:04,924
What do I have to do with their choice?

402
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,611
This is why we'd planned it with Afzal

403
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:09,268
That under any such circumstance,

404
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:12,670
He'd leave Hyderabad for a month or two.

405
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,481
But -- I don't know what suddenly got into him,

406
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:20,768
He brought you and Uncle Reverend over to my place to get engaged to me.

407
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,270
I believe your purity.

408
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:37,291
Place your hand over the Honourable Qur'an and swear that everything you've said is true.

409
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,028
Hold it, Farah.

410
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:40,699
Wait.

411
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,840
Ask <i>me</i> instead.

412
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,690
I can place my hand over the Qur'an and swear

413
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,920
That everything she's said is true.

414
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,725
Peace be upon you, Monsieur.

415
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,458
And upon you, peace.

416
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,651
Who's come?

417
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,435
Mesdemoiselles Farah and Lubna.

418
00:29:23,602 --> 00:29:24,360
Right...

419
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,951
Everything alright?

420
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:28,003
Everything's fine.

421
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,793
Alright, my dear.

422
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:34,881
There, now!

423
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,380
Speak of the Devil!

424
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,489
God has willed for him such a long life!

425
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,429
Come here, my son.

426
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,839
We were missing and waiting for none but you.

427
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,201
Come here, my dear, why are you embarrassed?

428
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:55,017
Who's the outsider here, whose presence has you petrified?

429
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,860
There's good old Lubna,

430
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,111
And with her,

431
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,996
Sweet Farah.

432
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,810
She's come here to listen to all her letters!

433
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,410
You read them out with such evident pleasure!

434
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,430
And the poor lass cannot even remember what she's been writing to you all along!

435
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,192
She's not the one who used to write letters to me, Mum.

436
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,937
Why didn't you take us to her place then?

437
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,928
I will, one day.

438
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:33,240
I live in wait of that day.

439
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,998
Peace be upon you.

440
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,904
Peace be upon you.

441
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,485
And upon you, peace.

442
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,630
You've come

443
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,795
To pinch us again, haven't you?

444
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:51,150
And

445
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:55,966
What's with this walloping before the guests?

446
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,398
The blighter's knavery has been caught again!

447
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,586
He's been up to knavery before?

448
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,240
He used to rob me of my serenity,

449
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,657
But now, it's as if he's killed me!

450
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,440
We'll take our leave...

451
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,250
No, my dear, how can that be?

452
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,451
You've come here for the first time,

453
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,060
And seeing this empty table, it seems

454
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,129
Like you've had nothing at all!

455
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:33,641
Sit. Please, sit.

456
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:38,795
Go, my dear, get some tea or coffee. Go.

457
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,026
And, Ruqaiyya Begum,

458
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:49,035
Robbing parents of their serenity and life is no robbery,

459
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:52,150
For both are a treasure in the possession of children,

460
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,819
That they can dig up and collect when they desire.

461
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:01,472
My good man,

462
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:04,460
Rob us of all our serenity if you want,

463
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,848
But please don't suck the life out of her just yet.

464
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:12,996
Your mother is very helpful to me.

465
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,533
Right,

466
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:17,368
Ruqaiyya Begum,

467
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:21,170
She's come to our house for the first time.

468
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,762
Do not let her leave empty-handed.

469
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,810
How's Dad, my dear?

470
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,966
He's fine.

471
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:34,010
And what are you doing, standing here like this?

472
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,628
Go and purify yourself.

473
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,597
Offer your night prayers

474
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:41,173
And beg forgiveness for all the sins

475
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:45,338
That only God and perhaps the four of these know about!

476
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,969
Go!

477
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,620
I have

478
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,560
A fair idea about what you want to say, but pray tell,

479
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,350
What's the news?

480
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,971
He's said it today

481
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:13,630
That she's not the Farah who used to write him letters.

482
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,940
Who is she, then?

483
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,831
Well, I'm sure you'd tell me about that later.

484
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,554
Pray tell, my dear,

485
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:24,911
Do I beg forgiveness

486
00:33:24,911 --> 00:33:27,222
On his behalf,

487
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,173
Or ask his mother to?

488
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,510
You're embarrassing us, Uncle...

489
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,897
My dear, if it's embarrassing to you,

490
00:33:36,897 --> 00:33:38,880
Alright,

491
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,054
I'll humour both of us to guard our esteem.

492
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:45,296
The truth, my dear,

493
00:33:45,296 --> 00:33:49,806
Is that I am firm with regard to my honour,

494
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:52,955
And I'm fully aware

495
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:57,787
That a child is a benefaction from God.

496
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:01,270
But, my dear,

497
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,700
I lack the courage

498
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,140
To return such a benefaction to God in my lifetime.

499
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,027
He's my only son, so naturally, I'm afraid

500
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:13,907
Swept away by emotion,

501
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:17,153
He may take a wrong step,

502
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:19,927
Or perhaps leave me.

503
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:22,560
That is why

504
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,950
I usually talk in such a manner

505
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,390
Before him

506
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,270
As I used to before my Dad.

507
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,329
So,

508
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:38,376
All I have said to him before you

509
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:42,700
Has been, by this standard, rather too harsh.

510
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,754
Yes -- I know...

511
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:50,565
Now that the truth has come out, it pains me so much to think

512
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:55,110
Of all the cates we couldn't relish that day.

513
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,488
All of you

514
00:34:56,488 --> 00:34:57,720
Must've prepared

515
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,460
Some real delicacies!

516
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,334
I'll invite you again sometime.

517
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,067
We'll prepare the same delicacies again.

518
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,425
No, my dear,

519
00:35:06,425 --> 00:35:10,915
When a man fears embarrassment,

520
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:13,831
He no longer feels hunger.

521
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:16,289
Now, how would I be...

522
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:21,349
I'll go and see; he may have bolted the door from inside.

523
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,550
There!

524
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,531
He's bolted the door from inside.

525
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:31,655
Check --
-What --

526
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,540
Afzal!

527
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,731
Yes, Dad?

528
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,800
You're offering your prayers, aren't you?

529
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,390
I will in a moment, Dad!

530
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,240
He'll offer his prayers.

531
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,125
You'll see,

532
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,691
God will forgive him the moment he prays.

533
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,548
Please, my dear, forgive him.

534
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,222
Listen!

535
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,833
What did you do there?

536
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:01,796
She's proven that she's not the Farah who writes letters to Afzal.

537
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:04,616
So that's some other Farah?

538
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,876
So it seems.

539
00:38:05,876 --> 00:38:08,800
Why was he head over heels for our Farah, then?

540
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,456
There.

541
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:12,423
That's one mystery left unsolved.

542
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,104
Nor could one understand

543
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:18,153
Why the sight of Farah brought him to tears.

544
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:18,915
Nonetheless,

545
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:22,541
The truth has been made crystal clear.

546
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:24,832
What's this in your hands?

547
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:25,950
I don't know.

548
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,617
Perhaps a shawl, a suit,

549
00:38:27,617 --> 00:38:29,080
Or cloth for a suit.

550
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,159
The Reverend said that Farah had come to his house for the first time,

551
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,249
So she must not leave empty-handed.

552
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:37,035
The unfortunate Reverend.

553
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:39,823
He's unfortunate too,

554
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,640
But one can only feel his helplessness,

555
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,410
And not understand it.

556
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,318
I hope she didn't show her fury there.

557
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:47,421
Not at all, Mum!

558
00:38:47,421 --> 00:38:49,509
She was shaking like a leaf.

559
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:51,281
And, given the kind of family his is,

560
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:55,510
Nobody would dare show a hint of fury before them!

561
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,487
They only know love,

562
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:00,627
And it is with their affection that they can kill.

563
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,445
May I go now?

564
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,004
I need to ask her, too,

565
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:06,961
Why she teared up when leaving.

566
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,750
At least I know

567
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,154
That Afzal is the only spoilt one in the family.

568
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:15,130
I told you,

569
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,574
There's one mystery left to be solved...

570
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:20,810
One's mind says he's not noble,

571
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,000
But one's heart cannot agree to it.

572
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
