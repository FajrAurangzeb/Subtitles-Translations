1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,826
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:19,080
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,219
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:30,655
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:40,870
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,610
Who was it?

8
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,290
Afzal's family.

9
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,010
I mean,

10
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,480
It seemed they were his family by the way they asked.

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,870
They must've come asking about him.

12
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,020
No, Mam.

13
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,460
They don't know anything.

14
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,010
They just came looking.

15
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,650
They're asking where he is.

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,020
Didn't you tell them?

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,680
That's what I've come to ask - should I tell them?

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
How many people have come?

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,070
Two.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,800
Father and daughter.

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,860
They didn't even mention who they are to Afzal!

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,140
Alright,

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
Get them inside, I'll get some tea.

24
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll get them inside,

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
And prepare some tea.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,016
You'd much rather sit with them.

27
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,010
Sit.

28
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,730
Come in --
-No.

29
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,890
I'm fine.

30
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,480
I don't need to sit.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll get you some tea.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,657
I'd like a cup of strong tea.

33
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,148
I like strong tea too!

34
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,548
I'll get some.

35
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,140
You've come from Hyderabad, haven't you?

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,150
Yes.

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,210
I didn't really need to ask that.

38
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:54,620
If you're a relative of Afzal's, you would obviously be from Hyderabad.

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,820
How long has he been here?

40
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,850
Not here.

41
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,616
Upstairs.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,000
But he's staying here, isn't he?

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,960
It's been three months.

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,070
Doesn't he come downstairs?

45
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,990
No.

46
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,550
He just came to give us some sweets once.

47
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,156
When he enlisted as a security guard.

48
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,690
What do you do?

49
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,730
Nothing.

50
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,210
Earned my BA a year ago,

51
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,390
And I've been at home ever since.

52
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,770
Why?

53
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,224
Because of Wali.

54
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,690
Wali is my Aunt's son.

55
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,710
He's got his eyes on me.

56
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,890
Eyes, as in?

57
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,360
Don't you know what that means?

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
What do you do?

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm pursuing an MBA.

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,960
It's my last semester.

61
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,400
Right. So he's 'got his eyes on me' as in

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,140
He looks at me the wrong way.

63
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,810
Oh...

64
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,000
As in,

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,580
You don't like him.

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,860
Ask forgiveness of God!

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,400
He's been married twice!

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,040
The cad's an ace ruffian.

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,970
He's a strongman around here.

70
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,630
All his strength ebbed away that day, though!

71
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,980
Afzal gave the sleeveen a proper pasting one day!

72
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,380
Pasting?

73
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,430
As in beat him black and blue!

74
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,400
Why?

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,670
Because of me.

76
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,150
Wali wanted to force me into marrying him.

77
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,760
It enraged Afzal,

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,131
And he gave him --
-A proper pasting?

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,920
Yes.

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,790
If he comes back in a while, that's alright,

81
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,690
Or we're headed to Clifton.

82
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,780
We live there.

83
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,850
I'll

84
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,130
Meet him tomorrow morning.

85
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,600
Monseigneur,

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,080
When I'd said that Afzal's gone somewhere,

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,850
That was a lie.

88
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,000
I was afraid about who you may be,

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
And who you are to Afzal.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,790
You may be shocked if you came to know the truth.

91
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,960
Shocked?

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,400
The truth is

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Afzal is in the hospital.

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,330
My nephew had shot him last night.

95
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,260
No --

96
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,670
It's nothing to worry.

97
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,570
He's fine.

98
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,640
The bullet just struck his leg.

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
The doctor's done with the operation too,

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,130
And he's said today

101
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,546
'You can take him home in a few days'.

102
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,020
Hey --

103
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,480
Wait.

104
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,930
Dad won't have tea.

105
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,480
You kept me so busy talking I forgot.

107
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,521
Put the tray down.

108
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,250
May we sit somewhere and talk?

109
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,990
Sure,

110
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,706
C'mon.

111
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,087
Start again from there.

112
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,327
Where?

113
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:05,826
Well, beaut, you just said,

114
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:09,430
'Afzal gave your cousin a proper pasting'.

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,950
I like it very much.

116
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,070
What?

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,476
You've begun to address me as 'beaut'.

118
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:19,555
Anyway, tell me,

119
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:21,825
Who are you to him?

120
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,984
Who are you to him?

121
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,580
I'm just his landlady.

122
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,521
Not gonna lie to you, actually, I'm his landlady's daughter.

123
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,801
A lie.

124
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:35,140
One doesn't risk his life for his landlady's daughter.

125
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,361
Touché.

126
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,060
Then,

127
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,160
What's the story?

128
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,780
You think the same too?

129
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,790
What?

130
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,350
What it is is I can't conceal my feelings.

131
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,050
What are your feelings?

132
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,290
This is the first time we're meeting,

133
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,650
And you're getting at such deep secrets in the first meeting?

134
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,240
Sorry...

135
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,866
There's no need to tell if you found it awkward...

136
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,037
There's nothing to tell, really.

137
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:05,637
Just --

138
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:10,660
Our squabbles ended when he clobbered Wali.

139
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,560
You had squabbles before?

140
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,740
Oh, those!

141
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,990
I used to think he's a hooligan!

142
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,520
He said one day, 'I'll chuck you out'!

143
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,420
Then?

144
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,650
What then?

145
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,210
I only found out later he's very good at heart.

146
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,647
Very good.

147
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,727
Good...

148
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,740
It must've taken --

149
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,460
At least a month to get to the heart?

150
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,920
A month, or maybe...

151
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,050
Two days?

152
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:46,110
H -- Haven't you asked him

153
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,550
If there's another girl in his life?

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,510
Nobody.

155
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,250
There's no girl in his life.

156
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,160
I asked him the very day Mam had the impression that he's good-looking

157
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,980
So he must've had at least one girl head over heels after him!

158
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,830
So

159
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,100
He said there's no one?

160
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,080
Wouldn't she have come after him?

161
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,790
For his part, he'd said, too,

162
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,609
'There's no one'.

163
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,240
You tell me,

164
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,200
Who are you to him?

165
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,630
I --

166
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,540
I'm nobody to him.

167
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,272
Your --

168
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,563
Father's calling you.

169
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,532
Okay.

170
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,030
She didn't even have her tea.

171
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,440
You haven't told her, have you,

172
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
That Afzal's been shot?

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,830
I haven't.

174
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,880
Good.

175
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,060
Her father, too, asked me not to tell her.

176
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,960
What could have happened if I'd told?

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,690
Who's she to him?

178
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,370
Didn't you ask her?

179
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,560
I did.

180
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,410
She said she's nobody to him.

181
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,810
She must be angry with him

182
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,550
That's why she said this.

183
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,050
Angry, as in?

184
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,580
Is she someone to him?

185
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,350
She's come after him because she is someone to him!

186
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,250
You silly girl!

187
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,390
She's the daughter of an affluent mill owner.

188
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,790
Think about it,

189
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,950
Why would she come looking for a pleb like Afzal?

190
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,421
God is the Greatest.

191
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,498
Greetings, sir.

192
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,116
Greetings. How are you, Mehboob Ali?

193
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,136
I'm good.

194
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:15,190
You've come here after long.

195
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,577
Yes, we'd

196
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:18,370
Stay here a few days.

197
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,410
Greetings, Mademoiselle.

198
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,440
Get the luggage out from the boot.
-Greetings.

199
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,350
I think you didn't recognise me...

200
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,187
I did alright.

201
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,650
Are we not going back?

202
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,890
Why would we?

203
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,160
We'd take him along now that we've come here.

204
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,270
He's not going back.

205
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,620
Who told you?

206
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,680
Just what I thought.

207
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,390
He's settled here.

208
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,070
He's gotten a job as a security guard.

209
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,270
Like the dickens is he settled!

210
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,770
Leave it be.

211
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,310
You won't get it.

212
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,850
So why don't you explain it?

213
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,000
It isn't exactly picnic, whiling away my time here in Karachi!

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,030
Along with a job as a security guard,

215
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,520
He's also gotten the landlord's daughter.

216
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,700
That's the scene that's going on these days.

217
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,870
Come on, Farah.

218
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,890
Don't use your brain too much.

219
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:13,940
Dad!

220
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,310
Don't you believe me?

221
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,590
Then stay in Karachi.

222
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,630
In a few days,

223
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,680
You might even hit the enlightenment.

224
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,461
He's a connatural blighter,

225
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:26,470
Leching after a girl where he sees o--

226
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,980
Sorry --

227
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,910
I --

228
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,640
Just uttered it spontaneously.

229
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,030
Sorry...

230
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,187
Are you talking about Jasmine?

231
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,988
Yes, Dad.

232
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,040
Alright.

233
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,760
Freshen up,

234
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,630
We'll talk after dinner.

235
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,660
I won't have dinner.

236
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,010
I don't feel hungry at all.

237
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,987
Listen!

238
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,940
You're accosting my experience more so than his disposition.

239
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,860
Someone my age, even if blind,

240
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,760
Can judge a man's character by his mere words.

241
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,350
Then you don't know, Dad,

242
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,230
What he's up to!

243
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,980
He casts such a spell

244
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,258
That blinds every onlooker.

245
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,767
Hello?

246
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,221
What's the matter with you?

247
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,970
Why are you laughing like that?

248
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,770
What

249
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,140
Was it that you used to sing?

250
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,780
'I've tasted blood'?

251
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,960
Innit?

252
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,030
Listen, then -

253
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,720
Well, this blighter's certainly tasted blood!

254
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,420
He's been caught here, too.

255
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,928
Caught?

256
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,400
Well,

257
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,940
What's it to you?

258
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,030
Whether he gets caught,

259
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,880
Or writes letter to another Farah,

260
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,340
Or has a pash

261
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,140
On his landlady's daughter?

262
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,830
He's still 'Afzal' [excellent] in your eyes!

263
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,050
Hey!

264
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,170
He's not like that.

265
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,500
Why don't you come to Karachi?

266
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,660
I'll introduce you to his new girlfriend!

267
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,820
Are you telling the truth?

268
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,570
I've just met her.

269
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,400
The poor lass,

270
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,320
She'd die for him.

271
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,020
I don't believe this...

272
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,000
It's broken your heart, hasn't it?

273
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,230
It's my fault.

274
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,980
I told you so quickly.

275
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,280
Honestly, though, she is quite sweet.

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,190
You're lying, aren't you?

277
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,470
I'd die where I stand if I lie!

278
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,420
I've talked to her for an hour.

279
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,210
She's very innocent,

280
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,660
Trapped in that arrant knave's ploy!

281
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,170
Which arrant knave?

282
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,260
Your Afzal.

283
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,590
Who else could it be?

284
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,460
I swear,

285
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,810
If you'd hear her out,

286
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,850
You'd say,

287
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,740
'Alright'.

288
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,250
'Afzal's all yours'.

289
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,040
I would never!

290
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,950
Afzal will only be hers whose he should rightfully be!

291
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,200
Alright.

292
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,370
I'll meet her again tomorrow.

293
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,720
Why?

294
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,740
I'll ask her

295
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,700
If she can sing

296
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,460
'I've tasted blood'!

297
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,030
She must be able to!

298
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,330
So?

299
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,110
So what?

300
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,810
The two of you will duel it out.

301
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,640
And the winner

302
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,650
Gets Afzal!

303
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,440
I don't think you're in your senses.

304
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
There!

305
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,840
Your envy has burnt you to ashes,

306
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,550
And you're saying I'm not in my senses!

307
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,580
Aren't you coming to Karachi?

308
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,820
Get a move on!

309
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,710
Why should I come?

310
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,710
Hey!

311
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,060
Will you come here after that rapscallion

312
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,200
Has robbed you of your love?

313
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,310
Take a sleeping pill and go to bed.

314
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,540
Why should I take a pill?

315
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,550
You take one.

316
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,010
There are four pills

317
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,120
In the drawer of my writing table.

318
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,980
You may take all four if you want.

319
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,970
Where's Dad?

320
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,100
He's traumatised.

321
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,840
Go

322
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,380
And sit with Dad.

323
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,860
You may end up doing something!

324
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,840
I was thinking of the same.

325
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,100
Let him come before my eyes!

326
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,620
I'll tear his face for you!

327
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,020
I'll jab these long nails

328
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,526
Into his eyes!

329
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,280
Why

330
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,960
Have you brought us to this room from the ward?

331
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,626
We don't have the money to pay the bill.

332
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:55,946
We've just been ordered

333
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,960
To shift the patient to the room.

334
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,410
As far as the money is concerned,

335
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,500
One gets a room in this hospital only after making a payment.

336
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,068
What?

337
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:07,370
You can ask the doctor about everything else.

338
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,346
He'll be here shortly.

339
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,350
I know who would have paid the bills.

340
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,497
Who?

341
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,606
Jasmine.

342
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,581
The man who'd come along,

343
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:47,021
He's a mill owner?

344
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:48,812
Yes.

345
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,840
Not being funny, she's the mill owner's daughter for real!

346
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,790
But why did she say she's nobody to him?

347
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,510
If someone asked you who you are to Afzal,

348
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,396
What would you say?

349
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:14,616
You can call Afzal and ask him the true story.

350
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:19,237
It'll save you the fatal trouble of thinking.

351
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,074
I would, Mam,

352
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,925
But I'm afraid.

353
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:28,446
When she said she's nobody to him,

354
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:34,786
Her eyes made it clear that she's lying.

355
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:38,340
Her lie has frightened me, Mam,

356
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,380
And my heart says that Afzal will frighten me with his truth if I called him.

357
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,250
We'll go to meet him tomorrow.

358
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,540
I say you ask him about the true story casually.

359
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,970
There's no need to ask now.

360
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,650
He'll be taken to Hyderabad tomorrow morning.

361
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,300
Hey!

362
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,886
How would they take him?

363
00:17:58,886 --> 00:18:00,248
I mean,

364
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,817
How can he go in this condition?

365
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:05,027
And won't he meet us before leaving?

366
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,187
Won't he settle his dues?

367
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:12,817
He'll have to pay every penny that he owes us before he leaves!

368
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,234
I'll seize all his goods in the morning.

369
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,290
I've given Kaneez Fatima the allowance;

370
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,030
She'll take care of your provisions.

371
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,990
Listen carefully, now,

372
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:44,216
Leave no stone unturned in cleaning this house; I'll check every corner when I'm back.

373
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,960
And what are you looking at?

374
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,440
Come on,

375
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,810
Put your bag in the car and come along.

376
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Where are we going?

377
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,100
Why are you asking this again and again?

378
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,098
We'd stay there for four days?

379
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,800
Perhaps four, perhaps five.

380
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,136
Perhaps we may be back tomorrow.

381
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,216
Quickly, now, come.

382
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,696
I'm sorry Dad...

383
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,550
I figure you've

384
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,310
Not slept properly last night.

385
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,030
No --

386
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,305
I've had a good night's sleep.

387
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,526
I can see that.

388
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:36,890
No,

389
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,360
I was just thinking what we're doing here.

390
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,280
We should've gone back last night.

391
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,836
I'd promised the Reverend

392
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:49,236
That I'd only come back with Afzal by my side.

393
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:51,528
It seems you've reneged on your promise.

394
00:19:51,528 --> 00:19:54,680
Afzal won't be leaving this place.

395
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,660
He will.

396
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,101
I know he can't turn me down.

397
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,216
Lubna and your Mum

398
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,657
Will be here in a while too.

399
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,438
Splendid!

400
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:08,400
Such sedulous preparations to bring him back!

401
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,980
Just the four of us,

402
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,766
Or is someone else invited too?

403
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,709
I've invited them because

404
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:16,467
We're not going anywhere for four days.

405
00:20:16,467 --> 00:20:17,327
Sorry Dad,

406
00:20:17,327 --> 00:20:19,828
But I'm not staying here four days.

407
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:21,367
Why don't you have Lubna stay?

408
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,660
Mum and I will go back today.

409
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,578
You don't know why we're staying here,

410
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:30,620
And you wouldn't want to budge from here if you found out.

411
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,886
Pray tell.

412
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:36,110
Promise me, first,

413
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,490
That you'll not call Arifa and her family to tell them.

414
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,860
Has he gotten married?

415
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,590
Are you in your senses?

416
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,850
Who'd he get married to?

417
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,441
Jasmine, of course!

418
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,160
Her expressions were just like a wife's!

419
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,850
Talking to her, it felt

420
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,736
As if she's missing him.

421
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:58,756
He's in a hospital right now.

422
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,550
A lad by the name of Wali had shot him.

423
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,057
He's taken two bullets.

424
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:17,436
And if word got to the Reverend,

425
00:21:17,436 --> 00:21:18,310
Or

426
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,706
If his Mum found out,

427
00:21:20,706 --> 00:21:24,189
I fear one of them will die on hearing the news.

428
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:26,976
So, I've called Irsa here

429
00:21:26,976 --> 00:21:28,140
To ask her

430
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,350
What I should do in this situation.

431
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,941
He's alive, isn't he?

432
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,062
Yes, he is.

433
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:37,042
He's had an operation.

434
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,000
Hopefully, he'll be able to walk in a few days.

435
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,070
This Wali is the same one, Dad.

436
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,930
Jasmine's cousin.

437
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,090
Yes, that's the name she'd mentioned!

438
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,220
Yes, it's the same, alright.

439
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,580
Afzal had beaten him black and blue over a row earlier.

440
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,750
Not just any row.

441
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,380
A row over Jasmine.

442
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,696
He'd fought for her,

443
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:03,810
And it's for her he's taken the bullets!

444
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,510
Lassie's the real deal!

445
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,770
The blighter put his life on the line for her!

446
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,730
That's brilliant.

447
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,301
Lubna will be thunderstruck

448
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:18,081
To hear this.

449
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:19,599
You're absolutely right, Dad.

450
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm not budging from here.

451
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,160
In fact, I'll go and meet him.

452
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,400
I'll even click a photograph of him.

453
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,240
The thing is,

454
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,616
One only finds such lovers

455
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,106
In books these days.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,130
Don't call to inform Hyderabad.

457
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,610
No way, Dad.

458
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,100
Am I not the full shilling?

459
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,406
Babu Hamid!

460
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:57,457
Babu Hamid!
-Yes?

461
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:58,617
What happened?

462
00:22:58,617 --> 00:22:59,296
What is it?

463
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,136
You're alright, aren't you?

464
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:02,476
I am, mate.

465
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,730
Do you want me to take a stroll to prove it?

466
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,265
Leave it be, boyo.

467
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:09,118
This...

468
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:12,278
How much does this room cost?

469
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,720
Must be around

470
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,376
8 to 10 thousand?

471
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,497
We're dead, then, mate.

472
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,977
Jasmine will incarcerate me

473
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:22,610
And say, 'You'll only leave after paying me all the money'.

474
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,006
Where'd you leave for?

475
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,720
I'd go to Wali once I'm out.

476
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,560
Are you crazy?

477
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,006
Let bygones be bygones.

478
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:33,460
Forget Wali.

479
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,370
I'd miss him more if it pained a bit more.

480
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,870
How can I forget him?

481
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,720
Remember, Babu Hamid,

482
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,810
It's a real bad habit to pick up a gun and fire it.

483
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,470
It should be nipped in the bud.

484
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,780
That blighter will kill somebody else tomorrow.

485
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,260
Who knows,

486
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,990
The poor man at the other end of his barrel might just die this time!

487
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,300
But don't worry, mate.

488
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,946
I'll only exact as much revenge as he deserves for his tyranny.

489
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:05,280
Find out after lunch tomorrow where he'll be for the next few days.

490
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,630
He'd be in hiding, Afzal.

491
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,470
Where will you find him?

492
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,340
He won't hide.

493
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,736
Not when a complaint hasn't been filed.

494
00:24:12,736 --> 00:24:15,147
He'd think Afzal's afraid of him.

495
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:17,500
And Dad says,

496
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,370
'The terrorised is worse than the one who terrorises'.

497
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,030
Once, in fact, he'd even said,

498
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,040
'The oppressor doesn't make the oppressed',

499
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,226
'It's the oppressed who makes the oppressor'.

500
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:34,316
Find him within four days.

501
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:40,546
I don't want that blighter to become an oppressor because of me.

502
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,540
C'mon, Mam, the rickshaw's waiting down there!

503
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,610
H -- Here. Take this lunch box.

504
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,426
And listen,

505
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:34,376
Don't start your inquest about that girl the moment you get there!

506
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:35,377
Not at all.

507
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:37,077
I'll ask him in private.

508
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:40,157
First, I'll see if she's there or if she's left after asking how he's doing!

509
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:41,409
Alright, get downstairs,

510
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:44,430
I'll be coming after locking the door.

511
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,890
Wali!

512
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,150
So you remember my name!

513
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,422
Who is it, Jasmine?

514
00:26:11,422 --> 00:26:13,452
It's me, Modryb.

515
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,473
Wali.

516
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:21,042
You filthy dog!

517
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:28,380
Get lost!

518
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,763
Your anger's not waned one bit, Modryb...

519
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:33,613
The same old style...

520
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:34,732
Hurled an abuse,

521
00:26:34,732 --> 00:26:37,402
Slapped me...

522
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:40,693
Think about it, Modryb.

523
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:43,483
I'm not the old Wali.

524
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:44,564
Oh, please!

525
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:45,562
Step aside!

526
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,944
I'm one step closer to my aim, and here you are asking me to step aside!

527
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:52,263
By the way,

528
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:55,454
Where are you off to?

529
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:04,780
You're going to the hospital.

530
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,986
What's in the box?

531
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Nothing's changed here.

532
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,580
The Modryb's the same way,

533
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,386
And the Modryb's daughter is the same old...

534
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,886
But I've changed, Jasmine.

535
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:23,160
I don't threaten anymore.

536
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,610
And if I ever do,

537
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:29,690
I don't give the luxury of counting to ten.

538
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,101
Move inside, now, will you?

539
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,650
There's nothing to fear.

540
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,593
I'll just sit inside for a while,

541
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:41,550
Have some of your tea,

542
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,280
Talk about some things and leave.

543
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,540
I swear by you!

544
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,652
Alright, if you want to go to the hospital after that, you may.

545
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,853
I won't stop you.

546
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:54,754
I promise.

547
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,960
C'mon!

548
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,561
Come, Jasmine.

549
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,485
Give the rickshaw driver a hundred and send him away.

550
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,940
See those two roughies over there?

551
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,941
Yes?

552
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:34,440
They're both Wali's men.

553
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,230
What are they doing here?

554
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,740
Ask what Wali is doing here!

555
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,049
Where's Wali?

556
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,816
Upstairs.

557
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,978
Hey!

558
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,939
Where?

559
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:04,440
Your oul' fella's in grave danger.

560
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,401
I'm going to make it clear to him,

561
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:09,810
'Now's the chance to run'.

562
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,651
'Otherwise, he's coming'.

563
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,930
Jasmine,

564
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,373
Give it to me.

565
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,389
Over here.

566
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,391
No, Modryb.

567
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:37,982
Don't do this.

568
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:40,570
I'll have her tea only when she serves me.

569
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,382
Only then will I talk.

570
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,723
Look, Wali,

571
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:46,272
Only show as much audacity as I can tolerate.

572
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:47,441
There, now!

573
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:50,472
You've changed, too, Modryb.

574
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:54,070
You've begun to tolerate her preparing and serving me tea.

575
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,874
Just one more step.

576
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,220
I'll have her tea only if she serves me.

577
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,871
You'll see, then,

578
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,032
I'll become an honourable man right here.

579
00:30:06,032 --> 00:30:08,642
You're just like your father, young man!

580
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:10,602
In his family, they'd poison a virtuous child

581
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:12,090
When one is born!

582
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,860
I just asked for one more step, Modryb.

583
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,000
You took more than that.

584
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,370
Don't get to me Tad.

585
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,081
He'd be sitting up there in Paradise.

586
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:22,920
God only knows what kind of 'Paradise' your Tad is in!
-Enough, Modryb!

587
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,230
That's too much.

588
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,146
Give me the cup, Mam.

589
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:29,817
I'll serve him tea.

590
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:35,307
That's like a sweet girl.

591
00:30:35,307 --> 00:30:36,766
Not just sweet.

592
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:39,256
But very sweet.

593
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,881
This warm tea,

594
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,611
The warmth of your hands...

595
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,400
Did you see that?

596
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,220
You've coloured me

597
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,610
With the hues of your tea!

598
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,310
Sit, now,

599
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,610
Let us negotiate now.

600
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,986
Go on.

601
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:05,926
Jasmine!

602
00:31:05,926 --> 00:31:07,987
Stay quiet, Mam.

603
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:09,520
Let me talk today.

604
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,886
C'mon, now!

605
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,450
Begin the negotiations!

606
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,396
I just have a one-point agenda, cousin.

607
00:31:14,396 --> 00:31:15,830
Tell me,

608
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,661
Won't you marry me?

609
00:31:17,661 --> 00:31:19,179
No.

610
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,260
I agree.

611
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,630
How say you agree to one point of mine?

612
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,619
Will you live with me without marrying me?

613
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:29,099
Wali!

614
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,057
It appears this option didn't exactly appeal to Modryb...

615
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:39,340
How about you?

616
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,350
I will rip you apart, you blighter!

617
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,740
Enough, Modryb!

618
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,220
It'd be better if the two of you decided who'd be negotiating.

619
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,950
And if we're negotiating, you'd better tell Modryb,

620
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,527
We'll only let our mouths do the talking.

621
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:57,006
If that's not acceptable,

622
00:31:57,006 --> 00:32:00,330
Let's talk about the second option.

623
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,010
Honestly,

624
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,550
Don't you fear Afzal?

625
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,500
I am very afraid of him.

626
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,966
But who knows when - if at all - the poor bloke will be able to stand on his feet.

627
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:13,736
Wait a few days,

628
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:15,970
The day he sets foot on the earth

629
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,550
Is the day you will no longer be found on it.

630
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,310
The next time he sets foot in this neighbourhood,

631
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,880
I'll send him straight to the grave.

632
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,980
C'mon, Wali!

633
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,626
To your grave.

634
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,973
Everyone else, after you.

635
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,436
Afzal?

636
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,910
Afzal!

637
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,906
It's you!

638
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,350
Lie down!

639
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,986
You don't need to get up.

640
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:42,808
You --

641
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,470
When did you come here?

642
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,386
How did you find out?

643
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:50,290
You think you've ventured into the great unknown?

644
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,050
Karachi is just

645
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,908
About 170 kilometres away!

646
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:57,330
Dad can find you in a moment if he wanted to!

647
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,930
That's what I feared.

648
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,500
If word got to Hyderabad,

649
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,990
It'll be trouble.

650
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,986
Oh?

651
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:07,340
So you think my arrival brings you trouble?

652
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,486
Not at all!

653
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:11,307
I'm just worried that Mum and Dad may have found out...

654
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,620
They can't bear such news.

655
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,106
Hold your horses, Monsieur Afzal!

656
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:16,866
They haven't the foggiest

657
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:19,550
That you've taken two bullets and are in a hospital.

658
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,370
Thank you.

659
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,830
Thank you for what?

660
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,660
I -- I'm saying it because

661
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,816
You've not told Mum and Dad.

662
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:29,377
Well,

663
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:31,957
How are you now?

664
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,760
I'm alright now.

665
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,940
I'll be able to walk in a few days.

666
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,510
What will you do when you get up?

667
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,566
What should I do?

668
00:34:39,566 --> 00:34:45,270
Get out of here and get straight to Hyderabad.

669
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,966
What happened?

670
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,580
I've grown weary of Hyderabad now...

671
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,256
I won't go there now.

672
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,880
Do you even know what condition your Mum and Dad are in?

673
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,546
They weep in your remembrance!

674
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:58,256
And you!

675
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,490
Why have you switched off your cell phone?

676
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,106
You're angry with me, right?

677
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:04,680
Why are you punishing Mum and Dad for it?

678
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,540
I'm punishing myself...

679
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,730
I'll go to Hyderabad once I've become something.

680
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,421
What will you become?

681
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:14,800
No idea.

682
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,220
You're not going to become anything.

683
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,140
In three months, you've just gotten a job as a security guard!

684
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,080
Have some shame!

685
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,770
At the very least, you wore a shirt and tie

686
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,238
Back when you worked at our office.

687
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:26,256
You --

688
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:27,587
Please sit, will you?

689
00:35:27,587 --> 00:35:28,947
Oh, shoot!

690
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:32,110
I'll stand here, talk, and leave.

691
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,076
Speaking of shooting,

692
00:35:34,076 --> 00:35:36,586
Where have you been hit?

693
00:35:36,586 --> 00:35:37,457
It's nothing --

694
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:39,430
Just two bullets over here,

695
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,999
But don't worry. They've operated them out.

696
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,089
But,

697
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:47,199
May I tell you something?

698
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,340
A wound more excruciating than that of the bullets

699
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,331
Was inflicted by the barbs I heard back in Hyderabad.

700
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,580
That may never heal.

701
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,000
That's why I've decided

702
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,918
To never return to Hyderabad.

703
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:05,528
You're very much alive.

704
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:08,088
But you're an ace runaway.

705
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:09,039
Alright.

706
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,341
I'm going; bye!

707
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,530
Listen!

708
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,062
Pray tell.

709
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,460
I mean, go on.

710
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,610
Won't you ask me

711
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,486
Why I'd brought Mum and Dad along for the engagement?

712
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,657
You're in a hospital after taking two bullets!

713
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:25,166
Worry about your wounds.

714
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:28,216
It's better if you just forgot about your engagement and marriage.

715
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:30,918
Good day.

716
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,196
Hey!

717
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:33,807
It's you, Jasmine!

718
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:38,166
He's shot Babu Hamid!

719
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,830
That --

720
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,000
That was her!

721
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,490
The one who'd bumped into you in the other corridor.

722
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,887
I know her.

723
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:07,427
Who is she?

724
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,426
You'll find out.

725
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:10,920
You'll get to know, too,

726
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,106
When she bumps into you.

727
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,020
You can't just go like that!

728
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,299
The stitches will tear off and you wounds will start bleeding.
-I'm leaving because I want to!

729
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,000
Let me go!

730
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,730
Sit down!

731
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,916
You can't just --
-What is going on?

732
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:32,076
What's going on?

733
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:34,660
Where would you go in this condition?

734
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,745
My friend -- Babu Hamid...

735
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:38,350
He's been shot!

736
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,260
I don't know where he's been hit, but I'm going to him!

737
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,328
Alright,

738
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,400
Please.

739
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,110
You're not going anywhere. Sit here.

740
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,490
Just a second.

741
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,698
Sit down!

742
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,987
D -- Dad!

743
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:56,427
Over there!

744
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,570
Hey!

745
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,280
He's bleeding!

746
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,785
Wait, I'll call the doctor.

747
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:05,047
Your wound's bleeding!

748
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:08,000
Please, sit down!

749
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
