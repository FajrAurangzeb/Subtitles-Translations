00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,406
Listen!

8
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,327
Where to?
-To Samina's.

9
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:14,487
Today's her wedding anniversary.

10
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,757
As in, it's been another year.

11
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:20,497
Is hers the kind of wedding one would commemorate?

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,498
Her husband does every year.

13
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,627
After all, it's her husband's 'love marriage' to her.

14
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:29,618
In two years of this 'love marriage', she's been beaten by her 'lover' some 200 times!

15
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:32,128
Only the Lord will ask her about that.

16
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,927
What will you give her as a gift?

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,588
Why would she need one?

18
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:38,050
She needs cash much more.

19
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,747
I think I'd give her a thousand.

20
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:43,188
And who will get the security guard his food?

21
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,098
I'll be back before he is.

22
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:48,139
And who'll tell you he's back?

23
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,179
Well,

24
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,948
I get to know

25
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:53,964
The moment he sets foot in the alley!

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,737
May I go now?

27
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,046
Yes.

28
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,757
Go.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,117
But please do tell me when you're back

30
00:02:06,117 --> 00:02:11,443
How you get to know the moment he sets foot in the alley.

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,639
Peace, Aunt.

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,996
Babu Hamid!

33
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,856
Babu Hamid!

34
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,525
Babu Hamid isn't around.

35
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,002
I've come back because of you.

36
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:16,297
Tell me you're awestruck to look at me!

37
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,886
Yes.

38
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,107
I sure am awestruck.

39
00:03:20,107 --> 00:03:22,069
That's why I don't deck up too much!

40
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,256
The thing is,

41
00:03:23,256 --> 00:03:25,040
It's Samina's wedding anniversary.

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,326
I'm going to attend that.

43
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:27,427
Oh.

44
00:03:27,427 --> 00:03:29,308
Good.

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,286
If you stare at me like that, the evil eye would curse me.

46
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,216
Say that it's as the Lord has willed [compliment]!

47
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,290
As the Lord has willed.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,466
Do you guard

49
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,896
Empty-handed,

50
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:50,007
Or do you carry a gun, too?

51
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:50,710
No,

52
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,106
I have a gun with me.

53
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,509
Where is it if it's with you?

54
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:55,340
Why,

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,010
I leave it there, of course.

56
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,541
Bring it here someday.

57
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,261
Why?

58
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,772
What'd you do with it?

59
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,632
Fire it, of course.

60
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:07,320
Wali would be scared if he found out!

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,164
You don't need to scare him; he's already scared.

62
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:12,066
He's scared of you.

63
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,649
If, one of these days, you left, or got married,

64
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:15,772
What would I do?

65
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,213
I'd be left alone.

66
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,520
Then, you get married too!

67
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,946
Leave that be!

68
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:27,447
Which lad would marry me while Wali's around?

69
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,157
I'll take care of Wali.

70
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,508
Just prepare for the wedding.

71
00:04:31,508 --> 00:04:34,239
Do I hear a proposal there?

72
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,160
Proposal?

73
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,560
Would you look at your own condition?

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,120
Earning 10,000 a month and talking about Jasmine!

75
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,987
When did I ever talk about Jasmine?

76
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,946
And whenever did I propose?

77
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:47,334
There!

78
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,245
That's it with all the lads!

79
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,080
If a girl rejects them, they'd promptly say, 'Sorry'!

80
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,627
'That's not what I meant; you're mistaken'.

81
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,906
I swear to God I didn't mean that!

82
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,966
You don't need to swear.

83
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:05,316
I'm 21 now, so I can understand what these things mean in a moment.

84
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,466
What are your plans for the future?

85
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:10,817
Plans for the future?

86
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:15,606
One should know when this blue uniform will be taken off and you'll become a great man.

87
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,578
What makes a great man?

88
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:21,300
The one who has a respectable job or the one who has a lot of money?

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,260
I have neither.
-Your name's out.

90
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,717
Out of?

91
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:27,773
I'd kept you as an option.

92
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:31,690
Proposals will line up once Wali's out of the picture, you'll see!

93
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,986
I thought once you got a respectable job,

94
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:36,896
I could think about you, too!

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,187
She

96
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:41,490
Must be waiting for you.

97
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,480
Who?

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,526
Samina. It's her wedding anniversary, innit?

99
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,487
Good Lord, it's so late!

100
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:48,558
And you!

101
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:52,148
You have such a habit of keeping one talking whenever one says two words to you!

102
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,512
Alright, I'll get going.

103
00:05:54,694 --> 00:05:56,219
And

104
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:00,077
If you need any tea, or even water, just ask Mam.

105
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,627
Alright.

106
00:06:02,415 --> 00:06:04,310
And don't stare like that.

107
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,526
Have you ever seen modesty in my eyes?

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,131
I can see that.

109
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,611
Your eyes should have just as much modesty, alright?

110
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,625
See,

111
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,780
To be comely is no flaw; please, do look.

112
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,390
But not in a way that it seems

113
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,590
You're looking at me the wrong way.

114
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,926
Fine.

115
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,186
I'll get going.

116
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,332
Happy wedding anniversary!

117
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,876
What is it?

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,330
Nothing.

119
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,710
Nothing, really. Sit.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,831
Where is he?

121
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,992
Hasn't come yet...

122
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:13,358
You've kept a cake with candles here as if he's on the way. Call him!

123
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:16,039
His phone's switched off.

124
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,490
So that's what you're so sad about.

125
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,409
Sit tight,

126
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:22,929
I'll be back.
-Wait.

127
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,340
Tell me,

128
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,209
If someone asked you what Samina's like,

129
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,825
What would you tell him?

130
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,704
Why are you asking that?

131
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,810
Just asking.

132
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,070
I want to see myself through your eyes.

133
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,101
I swear by your modesty and loyalty.

134
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:44,217
Don't swear by my loyalty.

135
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:47,610
I'm incapable of being loyal now.

136
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,051
What do you mean?

137
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,492
If you don't like it, just say,

138
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,843
'You have no right to live, Samina'.

139
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:55,643
Who said you have no right to live?

140
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:59,163
And why are you saying this today?

141
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:02,093
I'm leaving today.

142
00:08:02,427 --> 00:08:04,907
I was just waiting for you.

143
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,828
If he comes back, ask him

144
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:08,856
To forgive me,

145
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,747
And set me free.

146
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,620
It's you, Aunt!

147
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,320
Would you like to have dinner right now?

148
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,576
No,

149
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,829
I'll have dinner when Babu Hamid's here.

150
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:29,287
He'll be here shortly.

151
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:30,997
Alright.

152
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:35,047
Come here and sit. I want to talk to you about something.

153
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,417
Did you have a house of your own in Hyderabad?

154
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,955
I mean, you didn't rent a flat, did you?

155
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,611
No.

156
00:09:52,796 --> 00:09:56,367
Why, then, have you come here to work for 10,000 a month?

157
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,777
It's just...

158
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,890
That destiny brought me here.

159
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,086
Surely, your marriage is not being planned?

160
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,579
Not at all?

161
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:08,500
And you seriously don't have an affair with anyone?

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,706
I can't believe it, though,

163
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,880
That a lad like you couldn't find a girl.

164
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,857
I swear to God I haven't.

165
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,367
But you have now, haven't you?

166
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:24,927
You've put her under such a spell that she tries to keep you happy day and night!

167
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,440
Who?

168
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,050
You're being demure?

169
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,496
No, I'm a bit worried.

170
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,746
Why?

171
00:10:32,746 --> 00:10:34,186
Why are you worried?

172
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,826
You just said,

173
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:38,616
She tries day and night to keep me happy.

174
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:42,247
I thought you're actually talking about someone.

175
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,536
I'm talking about Jasmine.

176
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,731
She's...

177
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,660
She's... Very nice,

178
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,250
Yes, she does look a tad like the angry type, but

179
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,176
She isn't <i>really</i> that type.

180
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:02,267
So, what do you think about her?

181
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:07,247
Or do I have to tell you what she thinks about you?

182
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,166
Jasmine?
-Samina's leaving, Mam!

183
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,701
She won't live with him anymore.

184
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,541
She's packing her things and saying,

185
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,777
'Forgive me',

186
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:23,068
'But I won't live with Salim any longer'.

187
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:25,858
Come with me. This way.

188
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,332
Samina?

189
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,270
Where are you going at this hour?

190
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,237
He's fallen from a moving bus!

191
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,076
Lost his phone, too!

192
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,206
He's got injuries on his head and face.

193
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:41,670
But he's fine now.

194
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,882
He was using someone else's phone,

195
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:46,158
And said, 'I'd have to stay at the hospital'.

196
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:47,658
'It'd be better if you come'.

197
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,854
In that case, take Afzal along.
-No.

198
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,384
He suspects Afzal, too.

199
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,970
Afzal scolded him one day,

200
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,610
And he quietened.

201
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,372
He came home drunk yesterday, saying, 'Tell me everything',

202
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:01,390
'What's going on between the two of you'?

203
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,565
He's never going to change.

204
00:12:03,565 --> 00:12:05,516
But don't worry.

205
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,937
I'm not going anywhere.

206
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,026
Good morning, sir.

207
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,776
Good morning.

208
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,727
Very good morning.

209
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:37,199
Tell me, now,

210
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,600
Do you remember me?

211
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,409
The name's Mehtab.

212
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,875
Mehtab Chawla.

213
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,827
Don't you remember?

214
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,632
Farah Ibrahim's fiancé.

215
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,170
The engagement may have been temporarily broken, but that does not mean I'd forget you.

216
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,670
Whatever are you, mate?

217
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,832
Working as a security guard, dreaming of marrying Farah Ibrahim?

218
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,202
I don't, anymore.

219
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,147
In plainer words, she's found out about your situation.

220
00:13:18,147 --> 00:13:19,917
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,906
Can you see this office?

222
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:27,012
Which office, sir?

223
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:30,853
Why, the same you're supposed to be guarding.

224
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,370
I can, sir.

225
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,581
I'm having an office just as big as this one built.

226
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:41,167
If you want, you can leave this job and come to me for work.

227
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,120
I'll even give you a raise.

228
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,176
Thank you, sir.

229
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,580
How much do you earn?

230
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,550
10,000 a month.

231
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,122
Sweet Jesus!

232
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,466
10,000 a month, and

233
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:01,177
Loving Farah Ibrahim!

234
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:04,147
Leave love out of this, sir.

235
00:14:04,147 --> 00:14:06,951
When love came into this world,

236
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:10,805
It didn't bring wealth to this world.

237
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,026
Good one.

238
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,707
Stay with it.

239
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,256
We'll meet again

240
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,297
After the break.

241
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,757
Have you bought the cake?

242
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:41,007
Bought the cake, and some sweets, too.

243
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:44,077
Monseigneur said that it's not proper to bring just a cake.

244
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,908
That's right, but for those whose son's missing...

245
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:49,357
How could I give them sweets?

246
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:50,283
Anyway,

247
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:52,257
He'll be found if he's gone missing.

248
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:56,008
I'll say it's for searching for him. Let's go.

249
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,156
Come.

250
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:19,226
Get the glass fitted nice and quick.

251
00:15:20,342 --> 00:15:22,898
Mademoiselle, it seems like someone's thrown a stone at this!

252
00:15:22,898 --> 00:15:24,462
A flower vase, not a stone.

253
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:28,103
But don't keep on talking; get the glass fixed.

254
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,411
Caution: Under construction!

255
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,082
The vase is alright, innit?

256
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,326
Nobody's downstairs except the servants.

257
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:50,027
Where's Mum?

258
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:52,897
She's gone to Afzal's.

259
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,657
Who is it?

260
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,546
Peace be upon you. It's you, Aunt!

261
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:08,111
And upon you, peace.

262
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:10,510
Mum, would you look at who's here!

263
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,060
Come.

264
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,937
In the name of the Lord [auspicious beginning].

265
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,236
What are the sweets and cake for?

266
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,106
I'll tell you in a moment.

267
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,736
But first, give me a hug.

268
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,850
I've come to your place for the first time.

269
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,156
That's what this is for.

270
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,643
Thank you.

271
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,111
Please, come.

272
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,740
I thought you'd come to tell me about Farah's wedding,

273
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,726
And that's what the sweets are for.

274
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:07,710
That day shall come, too, if the Lord so wills.

275
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:12,166
For now, I just thought I'd meet you and ask how you are.

276
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,057
You're very brave.

277
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,720
The Lord gives the most formidable ['Afzal'] courage

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,786
To the one he gives 'Afzal' [the most excellent one].

279
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:25,971
Tea, or coffee?

280
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,573
Coffee.

281
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:31,545
Would you have coffee, too, Mum?

282
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:34,942
It's enough for me that she has a cup.

283
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,801
How are your daughters?

284
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:40,290
By the Lord's grace, they're both fine.

285
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,367
Farah had come to meet you.

286
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,482
I was scared to see her.

287
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:50,830
I even asked her, 'What has my Afzal done this time'?

288
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,436
But Afzal had left by then.

289
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:56,670
Yes...

290
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,441
It was only when she reminded me

291
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:02,762
That I remembered that he'd left...

292
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,481
But what's it with these lads?

293
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:09,062
They'd even tease one in one's thoughts!

294
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,896
Touché on that one.

295
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:14,546
Monseigneur

296
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:18,463
Came back from the Mosque rather distressed one of these days.

297
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:22,429
He told me that the Reverend was only praying for the good name

298
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,910
And righteous conduct of children.

299
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,151
My Afzal's conduct is righteous.

300
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:35,152
It's just that he has a bad name.

301
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:39,332
People have great expectations from a Reverend's son.

302
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:44,163
They say that angels are born to the family of a Reverend.

303
00:18:44,163 --> 00:18:46,820
One's good name is quite naturally at stake.

304
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,680
Monseigneur thinks the same.

305
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,180
He thinks one can't find someone like Afzal anywhere in Hyderabad.

306
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,160
Look at the Lord's doing!

307
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,170
<i>He</i> isn't anywhere in Hyderabad himself.

308
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,210
Please give me his picture.

309
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,256
Picture?

310
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,651
What'd you do with it?
-Monseigneur has asked for one.

311
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,491
He said he'd send one to Karachi.

312
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,976
It'd take no more than four or six days to find him.

313
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:25,591
Don't worry,

314
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:28,317
When Monseigneur's determined to do something,

315
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,582
He doesn't rest until he's accomplished it.

316
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,007
How old is he?

317
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,708
Old?

318
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,239
Yes, how old is he?

319
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:45,390
By the Lord's grace, he's completed 56 years.
-May God will that he complete another 56!

320
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,916
Arifa!

321
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,507
Bring the coffee already!

322
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:49,836
And while you're at it,

323
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,296
Get me a cup as well.

324
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,172
Please, sit.

325
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,468
I'll get the picture.

326
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,876
Hello?

327
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,217
Farah?

328
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,667
Yes?

329
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,368
Didn't you recognise me?

330
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:27,594
It's Mehtab.

331
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:32,059
But your voice doesn't sound like Mehtab's.

332
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,438
Your voice doesn't sound like Farah's either.

333
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:35,954
Well,

334
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,209
Let's be brief.

335
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,239
Why have you called?

336
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,880
Who's fuelling that arrogance?

337
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,141
The man with a gun doing his job for 10,000 a month?

338
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,652
Who are you talking about?

339
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:50,254
Your lover, of course!

340
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:51,942
Afzal?

341
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,412
Yes.

342
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:55,474
Your Afzal.

343
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,770
Where'd you see him?

344
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,226
I saw him twice,

345
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:01,897
And

346
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:04,157
I've just seen him now.

347
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:05,576
Is he in Karachi?

348
00:21:05,576 --> 00:21:07,312
As if you don't know at all!

349
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,183
I do know,

350
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:12,953
But I thought he may've lied to me...

351
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,377
He's been telling the truth so far...

352
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:19,188
So, tell me, where in Karachi is he?

353
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:22,264
He's a security guard at my friend's office, the bugger!

354
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:24,659
Don't insult him!

355
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,410
Alright,

356
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,927
Insult him if you like...

357
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:32,600
No problem.

358
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,626
'No problem'?

359
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,187
Tell me the address.

360
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:39,570
It's Farah, right?

361
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,780
How many times do I have to tell you?

362
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,847
It's not --

363
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:44,240
The thing is

364
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,951
Your voice sounds just like Lubna's.

365
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,140
Anyway,

366
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,136
Give me his address.

367
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,397
So he hasn't given you his address?

368
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:57,598
Would you talk a load of rubbish or tell me the address?

369
00:21:57,598 --> 00:21:59,590
I'd tell you on one condition.

370
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,656
Condition?

371
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,219
Go on.

372
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,120
Tell me that you'd reconsider me.

373
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,807
'Reconsider'?

374
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,828
By the Lord, he isn't your type!

375
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,390
He looks like a hooligan,

376
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,650
And sounds unlettered.

377
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,203
After all, status matters!

378
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,283
Yes...

379
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:18,964
Sometimes, I think about all of this, too.

380
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,413
Tell me the address,

381
00:22:20,413 --> 00:22:22,764
I'd catch him red-handed.

382
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:23,474
The blighter

383
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:24,634
Had told me

384
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,425
He's got an office in Karachi!

385
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,295
Hey!

386
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,426
Such a white lie!

387
00:22:29,426 --> 00:22:31,336
That's it!

388
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,540
Alright, I'll text you his address.

389
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,865
No, just tell me the address.

390
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:38,806
No need to text me.

391
00:22:38,806 --> 00:22:40,350
I've got a pen and paper with me.

392
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,240
I'll write it down.

393
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,367
Then, write down.

394
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,336
Go on...

395
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,596
Okay,

396
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:58,016
Thank you.

397
00:22:58,016 --> 00:22:59,836
The pleasure's all mine.

398
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,577
Okay, bye.
-Bye, but tell me, you'd reconsider me, right?

399
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:06,028
I'd have to, now!

400
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,448
Have a good day.

401
00:23:07,448 --> 00:23:08,788
I will.

402
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,408
You too.

403
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:11,938
Bye.

404
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,712
What were you doing in my room?

405
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,776
Looking for you.

406
00:23:43,776 --> 00:23:45,511
Why?

407
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:47,567
Well...

408
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,707
I'd come to tell you

409
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,538
That he'd called.

410
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:52,918
Who?

411
00:23:52,918 --> 00:23:54,208
Afzal.

412
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,679
He was saying, 'Congratulations',

413
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,080
'I've got a job'.

414
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,811
He's enlisted as a security guard for 10,000 a month.

415
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:01,620
So you'd come to tell me this.

416
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,531
No.

417
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:05,497
I'd come to tell you that there's no chance of a rejection now.

418
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:08,507
The lad's got a job now! Great!

419
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:11,258
What's his number?

420
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:12,980
Whatever it may be,

421
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,796
I'm not telling you <i>that</i>!

422
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,627
Monseigneur's said 4 to 6 days.

423
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:03,260
One can't tell whether it'll be 4 or 6.

424
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,167
Either way,

425
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:07,887
Tell him that one's gone by.

426
00:25:07,887 --> 00:25:09,328
Didn't I tell you,

427
00:25:09,328 --> 00:25:13,578
Now that Monseigneur's decided on it, he'd bring Afzal back.

428
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,048
That's alright, but

429
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,769
I don't have the courage for any more than 4 to 6 days.

430
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,790
May it not be that his ride stop

431
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,600
Only when my pall is borne.

432
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,291
God forbid!

433
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,510
May the Lord bless you with a long life.

434
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,500
You have to see your son's happiness now.

435
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,890
Whether or nor I see his happiness,

436
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,221
It'd delight me if I saw <i>him</i>.

437
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,182
Just tell Monseigneur about my condition as you've seen me,

438
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:44,848
If the Lord wills so, he'd be so merciful...

439
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:47,540
In the Lord's protection [farewell].

440
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,377
God be with ye.

441
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,001
Do you ask people to have mercy, Mum?

442
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,484
When have I ever asked people, my dear?

443
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:15,780
I'm crying out to Him

444
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,126
So that He may listen somehow.

445
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,366
Open the door!

446
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,817
There.

447
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,616
Give me his number.

448
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:02,167
I can't give you his number.

449
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:04,236
He's sworn by his head.

450
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:07,597
I'm having <i>you</i> swear by <i>my</i> head!

451
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:11,237
A sister's head is no more than a watermelon in front of the beloved's head!

452
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:12,647
Remember, then,

453
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:16,294
There'll be such a scene today hat you'll remember till your last breath!

454
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:18,245
Another scene?

455
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:19,955
Let Dad come.

456
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:21,385
You say that everyday,

457
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:25,656
But one can see clearly that you've not even talked to Mum!

458
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:28,824
One 'I've tasted blood', and you said that I was singing!

459
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,635
Give. Me. His. Number.

460
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:33,920
Don't even think about his number.

461
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,540
Have you no shame?

462
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,410
Exactly! That's the thing about love -

463
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,150
First, you feel shy and ashamed to admit it...

464
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,426
Then,

465
00:27:43,426 --> 00:27:45,816
You're left with everything <i>but</i> shame!

466
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:49,447
So it's gotten <i>that</i> far?

467
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:52,340
That's my grief...

468
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,866
Before things could go anywhere,

469
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:58,036
That wretch went to Karachi.

470
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,560
Alright, brace yourself.

471
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,176
Why?

472
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,146
I'm going to talk to Mum and Dad today.

473
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:06,287
I swear by you,

474
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,248
I will, today!

475
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:10,934
What happens next is your fate!

476
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,777
Wait!

477
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,220
I've got his address.

478
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,961
I can give you that.

479
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,157
Mum's here.

480
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,026
What happened, Mum?

481
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,597
Don't ask me anything.

482
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:42,402
This lass has been a tyrant.

483
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:45,992
She's earned the curses of a mother and a sister.

484
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:47,496
What's that in your hand?

485
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:48,983
His picture.

486
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:51,910
I've brought one for your Dad.

487
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,821
He's said he'd be able to find him in a few days.

488
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:56,940
You don't need to search now, Mum.

489
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,787
His address has been found.

490
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,016
In fact, his new cellphone number's been found out, too.

491
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,396
What's his address?

492
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:09,980
And what's his phone number?

493
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,006
The number's in Lubna's cellphone,

494
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:15,016
And the address in her hand.

495
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,222
Get it from her, will you?

496
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:24,150
And please don't tell me later that someone's cursing me,

497
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,981
Because it's <i>my</i> turn to curse now.

498
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,814
One incantation from me

499
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:34,525
May very well burn your sweet Lubna to death.

500
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,551
How come his address and phone number is with <i>you</i>,

501
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:48,987
And not Farah?

502
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,412
Why would Farah have it?

503
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:52,036
Whatever is she to him?

504
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:55,406
She'd invited his family here and left them humiliated.

505
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,137
And what had she said about him?

506
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:58,698
'He's a first rate fraudster'?

507
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:01,210
'A Romeo for hire'?

508
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,080
Now, if he's sent me his address,

509
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,700
Why is she up in flames?

510
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,801
I don't fear her incantations either.

511
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,451
The prayers of those who slander love like that don't work,

512
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:13,752
The prayers of those who slander love like that don't work, let alone curses!

513
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,814
Where's his address?

514
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,712
Here.

515
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,890
And phone number?

516
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,447
I don't have his number.

517
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,877
I'd lied to her.

518
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,280
May I go?

519
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,409
I'll take my leave.

520
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,500
Hello, Lubna?

521
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,710
'Lubna' again?

522
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,770
I'd told you I'm not Lubna.

523
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,400
I'd said it then,

524
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,632
But today, the number is Lubna's, too!

525
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:13,670
Mehtab,

526
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,640
Everything's upside-down in love.

527
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,706
If an honourable man can steal your heart,

528
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:20,703
Can't I steal Lubna's cellphone?

529
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:22,447
Yes...

530
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,347
Touché.

531
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:27,114
So, even if you get a call from Dad's phone,

532
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,855
Just think that Farah's calling.

533
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,665
Okay, I get it.

534
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:33,255
But promise me, too,

535
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:36,710
That you won't talk in Dad's voice when calling from his number.

536
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,226
Don't be silly, Mehtab.

537
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:42,147
If I call from Dad's number, just think that Dad's talking.

538
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,883
I'm not <i>that</i> silly either.

539
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:45,680
Alright,

540
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,670
Did you meet Afzal again?

541
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,481
Am I a pleb who'd meet a security guard like Afzal again and again?

542
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,756
You don't understand the dignity of work at all!

543
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:57,241
That's why I could never love you!

544
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:59,412
Please don't say that.

545
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,813
I've wept over you a lot...

546
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:06,044
You daft dimbo! You can weep, but can't respect someone working honestly?

547
00:32:06,044 --> 00:32:06,964
You --

548
00:32:06,964 --> 00:32:09,575
You're saying 'daft dimbo' in good humour, right?

549
00:32:09,575 --> 00:32:12,166
I wish you would've just kissed Afzal's face on seeing him,

550
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:14,439
Held his hand like a faithful devotee, saying,

551
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,355
'You're such a great man, Afzal'.

552
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:18,530
'While at this job, you didn't think at all'

553
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,480
'That your salary is just 10,000 and designation nothing'!

554
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,917
How could I kiss Afzal's face?

555
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:27,480
Seeing him makes my blood boil!

556
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,407
I feel like breaking his face!

557
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,986
But then,

558
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:35,747
I stop because of you.

559
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:38,152
Because of me?

560
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,956
You're impressed by him, right?

561
00:32:40,956 --> 00:32:44,877
He may do any lowly work, and you call it 'dignity', right?

562
00:32:44,877 --> 00:32:45,569
Okay,

563
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,330
Keep an eye on him.

564
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,630
Eye?

565
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:51,381
I mean, don't let him go anywhere.

566
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,285
I want to catch the blighter red-handed.

567
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:56,150
Why do you want to catch him, Farah?

568
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,421
Why don't you just let go?

569
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:00,897
You don't understand a girl's problem.

570
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:04,363
She breaks a hundred times over before her trust breaks.

571
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:06,824
Just think that if I saw him in a security guard's uniform,

572
00:33:06,824 --> 00:33:08,756
My trust would be blown to bits.

573
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:09,710
The bugger!

574
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,380
He would shatter into a thousand pieces within me.

575
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,016
You're insulting him?

576
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:15,897
When the tormented can't curse,

577
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:17,763
They utter insults!

578
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,880
That's spot on...

579
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,431
Just tell me

580
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:24,480
How he looked in the uniform.

581
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,646
Oh!

582
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,317
He's fair,

583
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:29,450
And with a blue uniform!

584
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,496
The bilghter would show such a contrast!

585
00:33:32,496 --> 00:33:35,227
The sissy looks hideous!

586
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:37,805
He's got a gun, too?

587
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,920
Obviously! A security guard's got to have a gun.

588
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,747
Good Lord!

589
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,456
Why are you saying 'Good Lord'?

590
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,130
He's the first soldier in love's legion!

591
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,517
He's not a soldier; the bugger's a servant!

592
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:51,792
He gets up to salute the toffs.

593
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:53,483
It's a habit with him.

594
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:55,434
He's Reverend Subhanallah's son,

595
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,215
He must've taught him

596
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:59,925
To greet even enemies and wish them peace.

597
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:02,130
Did he wish you peace?

598
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,166
Wouldn't Daniel have fired him if he'd not done so?

599
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,310
Who's this bugger Daniel?

600
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,014
Please don't call Daniel a bugger.

601
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:12,670
He's a friend.

602
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,701
Where are you right now?

603
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,500
At my office?

604
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,371
Go to M. Daniel's office right now.

605
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:19,806
Why?

606
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:23,972
I've told you to keep an eye, haven't I? Don't let the blighter go anywhere.

607
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:25,230
He won't.

608
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,691
Cads like him may desert a girl, but never a job.

609
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,591
You're right there...

610
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,329
That's why he's left me...

611
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,091
You're regretting it, right?

612
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:37,781
A lot.

613
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:41,842
But you don't <i>quite</i> understand girls' problem.

614
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:42,722
Hey!

615
00:34:42,722 --> 00:34:44,268
What's the problem now?

616
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:47,562
I want to see the blighter in a blue uniform for the last time!

617
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:49,153
It kills me to think

618
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:52,044
What the bugger would be looking like!

619
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,604
I like it so much when you insult him.

620
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:57,025
Just wait and see,

621
00:34:57,025 --> 00:35:00,925
Watch out for every four-letter-word I'd say to him when I've got hold of him!

622
00:35:00,925 --> 00:35:03,244
Then, I promise you, Farah Ibrahim,

623
00:35:03,244 --> 00:35:04,935
I won't let him go anywhere.

624
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,925
He'd be there until you've got your hands on him.

625
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:09,791
Swear by me.

626
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,832
I swear by your head.

627
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:13,002
So sweet of you.

628
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:14,303
Bye...

629
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:15,813
Hold on!

630
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,333
Don't disconnect just yet.

631
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,900
Do you want to say something?

632
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,556
Just tell me

633
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:24,807
Whose number would you call from the next time?

634
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:26,246
I swear by you,

635
00:35:26,246 --> 00:35:29,746
Next time, I'll call from my own number.

636
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,687
Bye.

637
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:01,050
The engagement may have been temporarily broken, but that does not mean I'd forget you.

638
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,510
Whatever are you, mate?

639
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,927
Working as a security guard, dreaming of marrying Farah Ibrahim?

640
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,673
I'm having an office just as big as this one built.

641
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:53,320
If you want, you can leave this job and come to me for work.

642
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,240
I'll even give you a raise.

643
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,316
Thank you, sir.

644
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,841
How much do you earn?

645
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,777
10,000 a month.

646
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,836
You're a Reverend's son, aren't you?

647
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:35,187
So, I give you this chance -

648
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,433
Say your prayers.

649
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,349
Time's running out...

650
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,696
You can't say your prayers while I count to ten.

651
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,226
Don't count to ten.

652
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,410
I've said my prayers.

653
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,980
<i>Your</i> time's running out, now.

654
00:39:14,534 --> 00:39:16,315
Shoot the bugger!

655
00:39:16,315 --> 00:39:18,246
He's got something going on!

656
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:22,447
He'd kill me if he got out! What are you waiting for? Shoot the bugger!

657
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,000
Afzal!

658
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,520
Afzal!
