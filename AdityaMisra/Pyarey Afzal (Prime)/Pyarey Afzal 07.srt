1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,831
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:19,100
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,209
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:30,629
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:36,116
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,116 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,136
Whatever happens to you every time?

8
00:02:22,136 --> 00:02:23,710
Blowing hot and cold like that!

9
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,426
Mind your temperature, would you?

10
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,822
I can't look Dad in the eyes...

11
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,962
I feel as if I've committed a grave mistake.

12
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:40,120
Instead of making a right bags of it, I should've taken Mum into confidence and told her I'm not marrying Mehtab.

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,710
I'm not marrying anyone!

14
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,951
I'm going to London for my MPhil.

15
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,350
What could be done now?

16
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,726
Why not?

17
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:50,012
Dad could be saved from this sorrow called Afzal by telling the truth!

18
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:52,610
Dad won't trust you for the rest of your life!

19
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,941
He'll think you lie openly, and I back you up with false statements!

20
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,080
What's my fault?

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
Why are you besmirching <i>my</i> image?
-You're worried about <i>your<i> image?

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,781
And it's killing me to see Dad's woe!

23
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,441
Woe will engulf him anyhow

24
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,021
Whether you decline Mehtab,

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,540
Or stay adamant about Afzal.

26
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,880
I hear Dad had made yours and Mehtab's match in your childhood.

27
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,027
Thank God his Dad's no more,

28
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,807
Or he'd be at our doorstep, creating a ruckus,

29
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,540
Telling everyone

30
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,578
'Ibrahim is not true to his words'!

31
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,877
Idea!

32
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,872
Ever tripped in a swamp?

33
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:45,502
Yes, once...

34
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:48,023
Don't you remember --
-I do. Don't remind me.

35
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,923
Just remember that those who trip don't get ideas.

36
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,614
Then

37
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:54,759
Should I remain firm?

38
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,280
You'll have to.

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,850
Don't try to disgrace me in Dad's eyes!

40
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,700
Call Afzal.

41
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,290
What do I tell him?

42
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,140
Why,

43
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,381
Fix a meeting for tomorrow!

44
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,759
Why don't you call him?

45
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,410
Ask him to meet come before the news bulletin.

46
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,880
If you'll meet him before the news bulletin, when will he meet Dad?

47
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,381
Why would I meet him?

48
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,981
You'll have to.

49
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,678
Sit with him and tell him what to wear tomorrow

50
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,659
How to comport himself, behave, and talk,

51
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,179
And how to look back

52
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,399
When Dad stares at him!

53
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,720
How?

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,620
As if --

55
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,231
He's cadging!

56
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:31,446
Cadging?

57
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:32,912
Cadging, as in...

58
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,843
Begging, pleading.

59
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,834
Right, so...

60
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,214
How about you meet him?

61
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:42,373
Tell him everything one by one!

62
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,005
For God's sake, Farah,

63
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:46,610
Talk to him for once.

64
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,197
He, too, should see that the one he 'loves' is easily accessible.

65
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,257
Accessible?

66
00:04:53,257 --> 00:04:57,225
Or else he'll start stammering before Dad at the mention of your name!

67
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,276
Alright.

68
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:10,033
I'll tell you everything now.

69
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:13,822
He loves someone else.

70
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,678
She, too, writes to him twice a week.

71
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:18,729
It's an old love story.

72
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:19,516
So?

73
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:21,450
Try to understand, Farah.

74
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,542
To get such a connatural lover to feign love for another girl is not easy.

75
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,398
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

76
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,759
It's no big deal.

77
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,010
Besides, for the amount you're offering,

78
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,856
Any indigent artist would agree to give his best performance!

79
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,987
He's my friend's brother,

80
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:44,617
And hasn't got a job these days,

81
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,743
I thought he'd earn something this way.

82
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,800
Where do I meet him?

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,971
At the same restaurant.

84
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:54,884
You'll see.

85
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,950
He'll die of greed.

86
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,040
If his girlfriend found out

87
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,750
You'll see what she does to him!

88
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,393
Call him.

89
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:04,454
Wait.

90
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,664
I'll get my phone.

91
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,530
He's meeting me tomorrow.

92
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,679
I'll say it flatly,

93
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,711
'Take your one million',

94
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,671
'And spare our lives'!

95
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,260
Don't say such a thing.

96
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,441
Why?

97
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:40,662
As if I have anything to fear from him!

98
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:42,452
I fear him.

99
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,282
He's not that type.

100
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:46,900
I don't know what you've seen in him.

101
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,055
It was just yesterday when he used to gamble on matches!

102
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:51,110
He'd win some and lose some.

103
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,760
But he's certain to win here.

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,190
Say yes,

105
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,340
Take his one million,

106
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,841
And make himself scarce.

107
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:01,843
Alright, satisfy yourself.

108
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,334
But please,

109
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:05,010
Stay quiet if he says anything back.

110
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,410
Don't let him go.

111
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,790
Should I have him stay if he turns rude?

112
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,050
He won't turn rude.

113
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,649
Just ask him not to leave before meeting me.

114
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,975
Hello?

115
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:47,061
It's Farah.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,135
Hello?

117
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,111
You listening?

118
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,960
He's not even listening!

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,150
I'm listening.

120
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,480
Well, then, I want to hear it!

121
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,499
Yes?

122
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,680
We're meeting at the same restaurant

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,950
At 1 p.m. tomorrow.

124
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,800
You'll be meeting Dad tomorrow

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,910
No --

126
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,676
You'll meet Mum first.

127
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:25,530
We'll go to the boutique from there, and get you a fine suit.

128
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,965
And listen to this carefully,

129
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:31,480
Mum is more inflamed at the sound of your name than Dad!

130
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,050
Come with your parts thoroughly rehearsed.

131
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,411
You'll be heading for our place from there.

132
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,903
Okay?

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,940
At least say okay!

134
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,656
He's not saying it...

135
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,900
Are you there?

136
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,529
Lubna speaking.

137
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,809
I recognised your voice.

138
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
Do you understand it?

139
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,811
Understand what?

140
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:06,551
Farah just told you about the meeting tomorrow.

141
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:08,042
I heard it.

142
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,991
So, when are you coming?

143
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,982
Where?

144
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,663
To the restaurant, of course!

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,580
Tell me, when should I come?

146
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,191
At one.

147
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,912
1 p.m.

148
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,890
Obviously...

149
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,490
It's not like she'd meet me at 1 a.m.

150
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,255
Don't worry.

151
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,466
I'll be there.

152
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,540
Do you remember that you're meeting Mum tomorrow?

153
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,050
I'll meet anyone after that.

154
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,160
No problem.

155
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,090
Alright then.

156
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,750
Listen.

157
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,853
Pray tell!

158
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,120
The thing is --

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,360
Farah had called me before you did.

160
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,990
Said 'Hello', told me her name, and disconnected the call.

161
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,290
Oh God...

162
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:54,530
Why are you saying 'Oh God'?

163
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,690
Just...

164
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,430
'By the way'.

165
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,490
Will she be coming tomorrow too?

166
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,660
She'll be coming; I'll just accompany her.

167
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,460
I'll pay for dinner then.

168
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,050
Why?

169
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,945
Just 'by the way'.

170
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,205
What happened?

171
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,510
Mum will devour him like a bonne bouche!

172
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,920
Oh God...

173
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,147
Yes...

174
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,100
Yeah!

175
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,540
I'd told you earlier!

176
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,551
Dad...

177
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,403
May you live long.

178
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,395
Why hasn't he

179
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:25,215
Taken his lunch box today?

180
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,230
He has a working lunch today at his office.

181
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,970
Oh.

182
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:35,731
You still suspect him?

183
00:11:36,461 --> 00:11:40,671
A father's questions are not a mark of suspicion, my dear.

184
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,901
They are a mark of care and prudence.

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,361
Who brought this English newspaper?

186
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,834
Who else could it be?

187
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:53,259
He's been reading it for two days!

188
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,080
Oh...

189
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,281
Somebody must've thrown him a jibe over his English...

190
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,395
Listen,

191
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,206
Ruqaiyya!

192
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,911
I'll be attending a congregation,

193
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:09,034
And heading to the Mosque on the way back.

194
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:10,811
Alright.

195
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,716
Alright, my dear. Goodbye.

196
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,176
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

197
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,912
It was the Reverend,

198
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,520
He's attending a congregation.

199
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,880
No, he has not the slightest interest in politics.

200
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,380
His 'congregations' are not congregations, really.

201
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,391
It's a congregation for him wherever

202
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:33,211
A handful of pious people gather to listen to his sermons.

203
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,490
Sir,

204
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,720
Would you like to have some tea?

205
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,304
Yes, please.

206
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,109
Okay, sir.

207
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,200
Listen!
-Yes, sir?

208
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,729
I hope you remember.

209
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:03,140
What, sir?

210
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,829
Come here.

211
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
I'll pay the bill.

212
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,630
Of course, I remember, sir.

213
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,567
Alright.

214
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,250
Okay, sir.

215
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,675
Why are you laughing?

216
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,300
I thought I'd put on this cream because I don't have any aftershave.

217
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,410
And

218
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,040
It isn't yours.

219
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,660
Where'd <i>you</i> get this cream?

220
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,990
I bought it.

221
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,890
When? You didn't step out of the house.

222
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,860
I bought it on my way back from the office yesterday.

223
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,785
You wouldn't have seen it.

224
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,410
You're brilliant.

225
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,910
When you could go and buy that,

226
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,510
Why didn't you get some aftershave?

227
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,845
It costs 450!

228
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,600
And this one costs 120.

229
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,500
Satisfied?

230
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,940
Where is he?

231
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,426
Right over there.

232
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,520
Hi!

233
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,610
Hi!

234
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
Please, sit.

235
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,500
Yes.

236
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,113
How long have you been here?

237
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,994
Since 9.30.

238
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,705
9.30?

239
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,825
But we asked you to come at 1.00?

240
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,410
I -- I leave for -- my office at 9.

241
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,609
I haven't told my family that I've left the job.

242
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,521
What would you like to have?
-You're feeling hungry?

243
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:03,190
No.

244
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,440
That's great.

245
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,211
My very life is at risk here, and you're asking me what I'll have?

246
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:09,345
I haven't even had a cup of tea since the morning!

247
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,616
Now, I'll only have something

248
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:13,110
When you've won this round.

249
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,890
Round?

250
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,160
This thing about the round is a new one.

251
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,632
You didn't mention this.

252
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,530
You're meeting Mum at 5.

253
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,890
I remember that.

254
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,140
That's a round of the fights, so to speak.

255
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,170
Oh...

256
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,290
She'll be talking rough and coarse.

257
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,141
But you'll reply to her jovially and listen quietly.

258
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:37,171
You understand 'jovially', don't you?

259
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:38,902
I do.

260
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,040
But

261
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,704
It'd be better if you explained.

262
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:46,395
Even if she uses an expletive, keep smiling.

263
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:47,804
She'd use expletives?

264
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:50,060
No. She won't.

265
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,490
But she'll definitely say something

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,320
That'll be as acerbic.

267
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,710
Don't worry.

268
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll listen to it jovially!

269
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,816
What would you like to have, sir?

270
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:03,182
What would I have --?

271
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,913
I mean, what would you like to eat?

272
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:06,550
You --

273
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,570
You're bothered about food, old chap?

274
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,210
Okay, sir...

275
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,180
What else do I tell him?

276
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,380
Right.

277
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,470
Don't stand before Mum

278
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,691
Like a servant.

279
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,900
Here.

280
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,892
Like this.

281
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,700
Stand with both your hands at the back.

282
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,003
Sure, I'll do exactly like that.

283
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:40,986
And be sure to get your hands out of the way when you sit.
-But of course... I'd have to.

284
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,987
Get to the point quick when you talk,

285
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,546
Even if you utter a lie,

286
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,470
Stick to it.

287
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,309
You can think I've stuck to it.

288
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:52,380
And if something enrages you, make sure it can be seen on your face.

289
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,695
I will.

290
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,070
Exempli gratia,

291
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,260
If she talks about your status,

292
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,461
If she asks you,

293
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,360
'Look at your status'!

294
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,931
'How dare you love Farah'?

295
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,000
Then?

296
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,330
How'd you react?

297
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,020
Don't worry.

298
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,469
Give me reason to.

299
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,120
Act it out.

300
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,910
I'll tell you.

301
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,110
Put the tea cup back on the table,

302
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,690
And sit irefully.

303
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,550
I was thinking of the same.

304
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,436
But --

305
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,520
Under these conditions -- Would she offer me tea?

306
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,900
We even offer tea to our enemies!

307
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,280
Leave the rest to me.

308
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,384
I would've have had my breakfast if I could leave the rest to you!

309
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,430
Please, have some tea.

310
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,281
God willing, I'll win this round.

311
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:42,691
Waiter!

312
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,591
I'd like half a set of tea --

313
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,800
I mean --

314
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,683
Three separate teas.

315
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,020
Yes, I need Ibrahim Cottons' contact number.

316
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,939
Alright, thank you.

317
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,790
Hello?

318
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,390
Peace be upon you. Am I through to Ibrahim Cottons?

319
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,201
Get me through to Accounts.

320
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,390
And yes,

321
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,505
One more thing.

322
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:35,566
If she asks,

323
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,477
'Has Farah been writing you letters'?

324
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:38,920
Say it strongly,

325
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,790
'Yes, she has been'.

326
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,351
She may even say,

327
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:43,081
'Alright',

328
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,052
'Show me her letters'.

329
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,650
I will show her.

330
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,331
I will show her all of them.
-All of them?

331
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:53,350
I mean, I'll show her as many as she wants to see.

332
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,360
Gor blimey, mate!

333
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,040
You never show your sweetheart's letters to her parents!

334
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,441
Oh...

335
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,813
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:05,564
So, what would you say then?

337
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,380
I'll say, 'These heartfelt words are treasures in the possession of largehearted lovers;'

338
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,441
'It is not comme il faut to reave this treasure'.

339
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,685
Wow...

340
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,950
Now you're suckin' diesel!

341
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,801
Was it good?

342
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,422
What are you talking about?

343
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,874
This answer will gag Mum.

344
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,476
She'll never even mention the letters again!

345
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:35,187
Which cell phone do you have?

346
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,426
No --

347
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:39,366
I keep it in my pocket.

348
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,000
Are you nuts?

349
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,376
You'd wear a suit,

350
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,890
And keep your cell phone in your trouser pocket?

351
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,130
It's --

352
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,574
Not the type to show around.

353
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,805
It's dirt cheap.

354
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:54,430
It's ringing.

355
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,241
Excuse me.

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,780
It's Arifa...

357
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,281
She -- Calls me around break time to ask if I've had lunch.

358
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:09,615
Yes, Arifa?

359
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,651
Where are you?

360
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,906
At my office. Where else would I be?
-You're lying, aren't you?

361
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:16,599
Lying?

362
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,946
No -- You must --

363
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:24,516
Have a feeling I'm not at the office today.

364
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:28,637
I'd told you I have a working lunch at the office today.

365
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:29,593
So --

366
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:32,410
I'm at this restaurant right now.

367
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,911
With my colleagues.

368
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,211
Alright.

369
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:38,020
When will you be back?

370
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,462
The usual.

371
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:40,743
No --

372
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:43,068
I'll be late.

373
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:45,534
I have a meeting with the boss.

374
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:48,459
A rather long one at that!

375
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,278
Alright,

376
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:51,918
Bye.

377
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:54,838
I'm a bit busy.

378
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,146
Thank you.

379
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,486
I don't know what's the matter...

380
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:18,780
I'm never afraid lying to Dad,

381
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,307
But it scares me to lie to Arifa.

382
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,940
If you think

383
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,980
I'm lying under my oath by you,

384
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,320
Then I'm not wicked,

385
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,916
I'm the most vile and dastardly.

386
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,427
I said call him here.

387
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,987
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

388
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,294
Strange.

389
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:13,397
He's fearing me

390
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:16,018
And I him...

391
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,197
It'll be raining soon...

392
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:47,707
It will, sure.

393
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,856
Mehtab's wails rumble the skies,

394
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:52,207
And his late father's curses thunder down...

395
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,150
Shut up!

396
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,036
Knock the door to the trial room.

397
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,447
It's been 20 minutes.

398
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:01,449
He must've started admiring his self in a suit!

399
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:02,705
So be it!

400
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:06,288
I wonder how he'd look after 5.

401
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,366
That'll do.

402
00:25:45,366 --> 00:25:47,072
Keep it on.

403
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,657
I'm paying the bill and leaving.

404
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:51,577
Come at 5 o'clock sharp!

405
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,961
Come.

406
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,796
Give it to me.

407
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:21,000
When is he coming?

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,547
Five o'clock.

409
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,791
Five, as in...?

410
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,634
Five o'clock sharp!

411
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:30,701
Did you tell him who he'll be meeting first?

412
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,310
Yes, I did.

413
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,836
Alright, go.

414
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:36,806
And yes,

415
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:42,402
Remember - I don't want either of you downstairs until the meeting's over.

416
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,970
Hajira!

417
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,626
Hajira!

418
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,031
Yes, Madame?

419
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,567
Get some snacks to serve with the tea.

420
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,076
Alright.

421
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,610
Peace be upon you, Dad.
-And upon you, peace.

422
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,130
By the Lord!

423
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,223
We used to crave for rains,

424
00:27:18,223 --> 00:27:20,140
And now it rains twice a week!

425
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,641
God is the Greatest indeed!

426
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,501
God forgive...

427
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,327
Where's your mother?

428
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:36,321
She's

429
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,980
Getting the clothes from the terrace.

430
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,457
Oh.

431
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,846
Here.

432
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,886
This is completely drenched.

433
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:48,390
Get me some tea

434
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,436
And I'll forgive every one of Ruqaiyya's inanities!

435
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,758
Sure.

436
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,670
Dad...

437
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,720
Does Lubna's father come for his morning prayers?

438
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,547
Not at all!

439
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,060
Monseigneur hasn't set foot in the Mosque

440
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,900
Ever since Afzal's started working.

441
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,520
But why are you asking this?

442
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,410
Did you talk to Lubna?

443
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,620
He's alright, isn't he?

444
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,550
That's why I was asking you.

445
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,377
I'll ask Lubna how he is when I call her.

446
00:28:29,377 --> 00:28:31,102
Alright.

447
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:35,613
Come downstairs; I'm back!

448
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,572
I hope the silly lady doesn't get all drenched!

449
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,575
Yes, sir?

450
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,596
Tell me

451
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:55,290
I wouldn't get wet in the rickshaw, would I?

452
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,551
Not if you sit in the middle, sir.

453
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,637
Come!

454
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,805
Where to, sir?

455
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:10,352
Mohalla Naqshbandi.

456
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,720
Alright.

457
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:30,242
You're worried, aren't you?

458
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:33,266
I'm waiting for five o'clock.

459
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:36,018
I'm very worried, Farah.

460
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:37,303
Don't worry.

461
00:29:37,303 --> 00:29:40,118
He'll stand firm in this round.

462
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:44,770
You've begun to trust him already?

463
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,211
Only after meeting him today.

464
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:49,986
He was bungling every now and then,

465
00:29:49,986 --> 00:29:52,550
But one line struck me.

466
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,357
When he said,

467
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:58,482
'These heartfelt words are treasures in the possession of largehearted lovers'.

468
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,543
I was awed to hear that.

469
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:04,370
That a tongue-tied imbecile would say such big words...

470
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,767
I could never imagine!

471
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,756
Alright, stop here.

472
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:19,482
What's the fare?

473
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,560
300 Rupees, sir.

474
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,856
300 Rupees?

475
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:25,807
Isn't it a bit too much?
-Sir,

476
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,110
It doesn't suit someone wearing such a suit

477
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,992
To say something like this.

478
00:30:32,892 --> 00:30:34,572
Alright.

479
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,667
Here.

480
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,746
Go now.

481
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,367
He's here!

482
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,866
Wait.

483
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:03,566
Where are you going?

484
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:05,217
Someone's outside.

485
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:06,761
Mademoiselle Lubna had told me

486
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,197
That someone was expected at five.

487
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:11,234
Alright, then,

488
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:14,085
Just ask his name; don't let him inside at first.

489
00:31:14,085 --> 00:31:16,065
Alright.
-Go.

490
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,379
It's-a-me, Afzal.

491
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,332
Wait.

492
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,776
It's Afzal, Madame.

493
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,891
The Reverend's son, you know.

494
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:55,962
Alright.

495
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,492
I hope he isn't wet?

496
00:31:57,492 --> 00:31:59,643
He's half-drenched already!

497
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:02,624
Look at the ferocity of this downpour...

498
00:32:02,624 --> 00:32:04,194
God forgive...

499
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,460
Where's the driver?

500
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,780
In his quarters.

501
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,510
Shall I get him?

502
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,231
No.

503
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,345
Then?

504
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:20,566
What are you looking at? Go.

505
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,970
Get him inside and have him sit in the drawing room.

506
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,499
Go.

507
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,882
What is it?

508
00:33:11,882 --> 00:33:14,083
The Reverend's son has come.

509
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,390
Why are you dying of a shocker if he's here?

510
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:19,906
I've just come to tell you that he's not in a good condition.

511
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,357
I know.

512
00:33:21,357 --> 00:33:23,327
But don't worry about others

513
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,906
For you're not in a particularly good condition either.

514
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:27,860
You're not quite getting it...

515
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,880
Explain quickly, then.

516
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,177
Look at the downpour outside!

517
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,056
Oh, I hadn't the <i>foggiest</i>!

518
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,627
He's all drenched!

519
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,100
And if I'd opened the door on time,

520
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,766
He wouldn't be all soaked in water like this.

521
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:46,800
Why didn't you open the door on time?

522
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,417
Your mother had stopped me.

523
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:51,126
What?

524
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,597
Stopped me in my tracks

525
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:56,548
Started talking about the rains and the thunder...

526
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:57,859
Then?

527
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,569
The rain went on pouring,

528
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:02,106
And he kept on getting drenched in it.

529
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,516
And when she ordered me to call him inside,

530
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:07,257
He was drenched from head to toe.

531
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:11,506
His boots would splash water around as he walked.

532
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:45,399
Please, sit.

533
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,210
Do you need a towel?

534
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,324
No.

535
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,857
Do you feel cold?

536
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:57,537
I do.

537
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:00,140
But I won't have tea.

538
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:03,377
I'd come to meet Farah's mother.

539
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:06,047
She'd wanted to meet at 5, but it's half past 5 already.

540
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:07,848
She's coming.

541
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,926
Thank you.

542
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,970
Please, come inside.

543
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,206
Mum!

544
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:47,227
I'd told you that neither of you will be coming downstairs before the meeting's over.

545
00:35:47,227 --> 00:35:49,298
But why isn't the meeting starting, Mum?

546
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:51,019
It's almost 6!

547
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:53,148
He's come all drenched in the rain,

548
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:55,129
I thought he'd settle down a bit

549
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:57,048
Have some tea and all.

550
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:58,529
He's settled down.

551
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,930
Please, go on with the meeting.

552
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,387
Go upstairs. Both of you!

553
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,381
<i>Go</i>!

554
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,490
Who are you serving this?

555
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,836
You.

556
00:36:22,836 --> 00:36:23,732
Please don't.

557
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:26,103
I don't want to have tea.

558
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,626
Sit.

559
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,740
You may leave.

560
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,287
Peace be upon you.

561
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,296
And upon you, peace.

562
00:36:40,476 --> 00:36:42,830
I figure it took a while for the gate to be opened

563
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,081
And you got drenched.

564
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,770
Yes.

565
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,071
It's quite the downpour, really...

566
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:51,576
And would you look at the lightning!

567
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,142
And would you look at the lightning! All of Thor's fury...

568
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:56,667
Yes.

569
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:59,027
Our elders used to say,

570
00:36:59,027 --> 00:37:00,847
'When there's lightning',

571
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:03,976
'You don't go out in a black suit'.

572
00:37:03,976 --> 00:37:07,752
I stood at the gate for ten minutes in this lightning.

573
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:09,697
Nothing happened to me.

574
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:11,608
You don't fear anything

575
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,219
Because nothing's ever happened to you.

576
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,763
Yes?

577
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:18,038
You haven't had your tea.

578
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,420
No...

579
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,134
I no longer need tea.

580
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:23,724
Have a cup; you're shivering.

581
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,535
No, thank you.

582
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,316
I'm shivering because

583
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:28,810
I'm a bit afraid.

584
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,080
You're afraid of me?

585
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,430
I fear those I immensely respect.

586
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,790
I fear my Dad, too.

587
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,411
Where did you work?

588
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,731
I was a clerk at your factory.

589
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:45,712
I left the job after two days.

590
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:47,062
I know.

591
00:37:47,062 --> 00:37:49,823
I also know <i>why</i>.

592
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,188
What are you doing these days?

593
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,042
I've started on a new project

594
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,023
That earns me 200,000.

595
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:59,383
I'll work for four months on it.

596
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:01,204
Why only four months?

597
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:04,845
Besides, who's foolish enough to offer a third division BA like you

598
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:07,591
200,000 a month?

599
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,687
Dad says,

600
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:13,960
'Always seek association with the enlightened'.

601
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,066
'And if you have to look for them',

602
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,820
'It means the ignorant are far more plentiful in the world'.

603
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,820
As for the magic number,

604
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,823
Unfortunately, the project will be done in four months. It ends in December.

605
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:29,741
How much do you love her?

606
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,740
That's a good question.

607
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,969
If it is, please humour me with an answer.

608
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:41,226
How much do you love her?

609
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:42,786
I'm her mother.

610
00:38:42,786 --> 00:38:46,056
Who doesn't know the love of a mother?

611
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:50,306
Who <i>does</i> know my love!

612
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,392
What do you think?

613
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:56,869
Someone like you would fall for Farah,

614
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,949
And we'd give away our Farah

615
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,720
To him like a benefaction!

616
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,519
Not at all.

617
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,110
What did you think, coming here?

618
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,120
Nothing, really.

619
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,310
Farah told me you'd called me,

620
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,316
So, I came.

621
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:14,857
But now that I'm here,

622
00:39:14,857 --> 00:39:17,657
I'll only leave after I've talked about everything.

623
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:19,737
'Everything'?

624
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,496
I'm sorry.

625
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,057
Right,

626
00:39:28,057 --> 00:39:29,868
So what's 'everything'?

627
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,593
I wanted to say that

628
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:35,600
It is not meet, considering my status, that I love Farah,

629
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,299
But I have a right to love Farah.

630
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:40,880
Oh?

631
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,891
Who bestowed this right upon you?

632
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:45,257
No...

633
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,180
Nobody bestows this right,

634
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,896
Nor does anyone ask for it.

635
00:39:48,896 --> 00:39:52,277
Or else, one would have to take permission before falling in love.

636
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:55,670
This would make a complete haymes of it all.

637
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,727
A complete haymes, as in?

638
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,935
As in, asking permission

639
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:02,321
Of the one you love first.

640
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:03,856
Mention your status,

641
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:05,317
And ask,

642
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:07,618
'May I love you'?

643
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,890
What would you take to <i>just</i> love her?

644
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,470
Another good question.

645
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,597
I've asked you something.

646
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:23,973
How much money would you take to spare her life?

647
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,980
The thing is, I've promised on oath to Dad I'd never gamble again.

648
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,946
I'm not talking about gambling.

649
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:35,977
Only that you <i>are</i> talking about gambling.

650
00:40:35,977 --> 00:40:38,413
But it seems you do not understand gambling.

651
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:40,568
My friend, Babloo,

652
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:44,257
He says, 'Win the match, and the money's all yours'.

653
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,000
And you're saying, 'Lose the match, and the money's all yours'.

654
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
