1
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:13,870
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,258
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:30,592
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:36,141
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:40,797
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,457
Hello?

8
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:01,860
You're still awake, aren't you?

9
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,726
Yes.

10
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:04,301
Just stay awake.

11
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:06,205
I've found out about the lass.

12
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,507
Who is it?

13
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,380
Jasmine.

14
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,835
Jasmine?

15
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:12,655
I've agreed, beaut.

16
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,963
I thought that the blighter's adamant,

17
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:18,694
And he may pick any Mary, Jane or Susie in this chaos,

18
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:22,557
So, I've decided to sacrifice my principles.

19
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,313
Besides, there aren't any principles in love, are there, Farah?

20
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:26,234
There's

21
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,502
Just love.

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,910
Farah!

23
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,138
Farah Ibrahim!

24
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,842
Why are you sleeping here?

25
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,300
I'm not sleeping...

26
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,146
I was just sitting here, waiting

27
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:45,007
For you to get up so I could tell you what's happened in Karachi last night.

28
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:46,690
Target killing?

29
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,778
Yes, target killing.

30
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,780
Have a lot of people died?

31
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,400
A lot of dreams have been killed.

32
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,661
Those of the Farah who used to write those letters,

33
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:59,083
Those of Lubna Ibrahim...

34
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,620
That wee lassie's clawed the eyes of both of you out.

35
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,376
'Wee lassie'? Who?

36
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,129
Hold it, Lubna Ibrahim,

37
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:09,488
If I told you in one shot,

38
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:11,163
You'll have a heart attack.

39
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:12,369
I won't.

40
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,100
Tell me whom you're talking about,

41
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,680
And while you're at it, tell me

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,790
Who the killer of my dreams is.

43
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,840
Jasmine Afzal.

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,027
Jasmine or Afzal?

45
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:26,180
Jasmine is going to become Jasmine Afzal.

46
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,000
They're getting engaged today.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,499
Hey!

48
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:32,185
So he's actually getting engaged to Jasmine?

49
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,500
But you'd told me that Jasmine had refused?

50
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,259
I'd also said that she's proper cheeky.

51
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,615
She was saying proudly yesterday,

52
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:41,078
'I refused',

53
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:42,890
But she called me the next hour, saying,

54
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,110
'I've agreed'.

55
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,148
Right...

56
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,540
Should I give you her number?

57
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,141
What for?

58
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:56,132
Call her and say some of the finest four-letter words!

59
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,182
The blighter --

60
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,672
Dodgy lass -- riggish --

61
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:00,923
Hey!

62
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,402
However is she riggish?

63
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,423
She's marrying the one she loves.

64
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,952
And Afzal's proposed her, which means

65
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:10,503
The love isn't one-sided.

66
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,262
The thing is,

67
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:15,312
It's hurt me very much,

68
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:18,700
But one doesn't insult lovers.

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,340
It'd have killed you to hear...

70
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,979
Obviously...

71
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,049
But what could be done now?

72
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:26,069
The blighter...

73
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:29,979
He was never destined for me...

74
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,619
Make a vow.

75
00:05:31,619 --> 00:05:33,239
For what?

76
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:37,059
Say that you'd offer 100 extra prayers if the engagement breaks.

77
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,049
One who has a heart herself

78
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:42,369
Couldn't possibly curse anyone with heartbreak.

79
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:43,630
In fact,

80
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,599
I'd pray now

81
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,119
That the two live together,

82
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:50,650
And always remain happy.

83
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,856
They'd not remain happy, that's for sure.

84
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,269
Your heart's been broken.

85
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,837
It'd have consequences.

86
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,426
You'll see.

87
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,810
She'd weep

88
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,677
Facing Hyderabad.

89
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:03,610
Now,

90
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,447
You shouldn't curse either.

91
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:06,947
I'm not cursing her.

92
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm telling you where the 'love' of such dodgy girls leads them.

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,670
The blighter

94
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,080
Shifts from one girl to another when he shifts from one city to another.

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,551
He's not the type.

96
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,352
He'd left Hyderabad, defeated,

97
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:21,642
He'd have thought he'd return from Karachi victorious.

98
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,520
He'd be victorious to get engaged to Jasmine?

99
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,056
Whatever is this Jasmine?

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,587
A lippy BA pass.

101
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,496
She doesn't even have the manners of how to behave and talk!

102
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,697
Engagements can be broken,

103
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,247
But if he got married,

104
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,816
Not a victor,

105
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,988
He'd be bitterly defeated on that day.

106
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,110
Who'd defeat him if he came back a victor in love?

107
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,596
Farah Ibrahim, or the Farah who used to write him letters?

108
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:26,760
How long have you been sitting here?

109
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,841
Ever since she called.

110
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,169
Forget her.

111
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,416
Take a pill and sleep.

112
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:44,520
Just think you've gotten the news of a target killing from Karachi.

113
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,356
Such incidents happen over there every now and then.

114
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:52,036
Don't grieve over it too much.

115
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,800
I won't.

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,990
Just think you've caught a news story from Karachi.

117
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,046
No idea who's died.

118
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,592
You've died, Farah Ibrahim.

119
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,036
Don't take it - seeing that I've come

120
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,580
On the day of the engagement -

121
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,806
That I woke up, thinking

122
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,427
That I ought to invite you, too.

123
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:31,627
I've only invited you.

124
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:34,497
I'd told her there's no need to go.

125
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,416
She would've invited herself.

126
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,828
Yes...

127
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,437
She's had us promise we'd come.

128
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,677
The Reverend was asking before he went to bed,

129
00:08:44,677 --> 00:08:46,317
'What should I wear tomorrow'?

130
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,626
We haven't had anything new made...

131
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,947
Why would we need anything new?

132
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:57,556
We'd wear the same that we'd worn to that pretence of an engagement.

133
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,336
It was a new one then.

134
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,233
Anyway... So, what time have you fixed?

135
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:08,970
I mean, when's the engagement?

136
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,291
After the dusk prayer.

137
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,611
The Lord's willed it [Great].

138
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:15,770
It's such an auspicious time.

139
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,967
Where's the Reverend, Madame?

140
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:24,051
She'd sent him to get some sweets in the morning.

141
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:27,741
He was just left asking what the sweets are for.

142
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,492
Yes, Arifa, what are the sweets for?

143
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll tell you, too, when he's brought the sweets.

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,518
Everyone here has a penchant for surprises...

145
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:37,430
Like father,

146
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,757
Like daughter...

147
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:43,956
And like the blessed son...

148
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:51,266
That rapscallion gave me a right surprise, too...

149
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,016
What about the wedding? Is it this year?

150
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,876
It'll be this year, if the Lord wills.

151
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,037
If the Lord wills.

152
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:01,337
Arifa!

153
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:04,447
Arifa! I've brought sweets.

154
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,569
Here.

155
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:12,170
Oh! Praise the Lord... Such honoured people have come here!

156
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,510
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

157
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,560
How are you, Reverend?

158
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,750
Thank the Lord [I'm fine].

159
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,925
Peace be upon you, Madame.

160
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,456
And upon you, peace.

161
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,306
We'd just been waiting for you.

162
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,196
In the Lord's name [Pray tell].

163
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:26,707
It's just

164
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,220
That she'd

165
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,256
Sent me to get sweets -

166
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,017
Sit -

167
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:31,957
Otherwise,

168
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:35,446
I'm usually at home.

169
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:39,646
You've come to invite us to Farah's engagement, haven't you?

170
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:40,769
Yes.

171
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,440
There!

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,210
So you'd have to say that, now!

173
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,460
Madame,

174
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,610
I've never felt that she's your daughter.

175
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,397
She has a place here.

176
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,026
In my heart.

177
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:01,337
I await her coming all the time...

178
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:05,064
Thinking when she'd come...

179
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:09,927
And he treats her to coconut biscuits when she comes!

180
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:13,940
She's your daughter, Reverend.

181
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:21,027
It's just that she couldn't be yours, or, I'd thought I'd meet her here.

182
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,316
Oh...

183
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,996
Forget about that...

184
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:31,898
Here, Uncle. Have some sweets.

185
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,454
Oh, Arifa! We forgot about the sweets entirely.

186
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:35,925
Alright.

187
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:41,376
Pray tell, now, what it's for.

188
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:45,287
Our Afzal's getting engaged today.

189
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,397
I mean,

190
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:02,306
It's his engageent today, too.

191
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,997
What've you just said?

192
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,268
Were you lying to chaff them or terrifying your Mum?

193
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,209
I'm not lying.

194
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,708
He's getting engaged today.

195
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,309
He's actually getting engaged.

196
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,740
It's his old landlady's daughter;

197
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,762
He's getting engaged to her.

198
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,190
Her name's Jasmine.

199
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,604
Swear by me.

200
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,931
I swear by you.

201
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:53,150
The artful blighter...

202
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,987
How easily he can ensnare a girl...

203
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,890
Well, I'd always known that he'd give a befitting reply to Farah one day.

204
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,820
He just did.

205
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,027
You'll see,

206
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,588
He'll get engaged after dusk.

207
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,928
She'd wear the ring here,

208
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:19,078
And he'd put the ring on her there.

209
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,801
Good morning, Dad.

210
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,481
Good morning.

211
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,382
We'd gone over to Afzal's.

212
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:34,152
We've invited them to the engagement.

213
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:35,633
Take these sweets.

214
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:38,022
Arifa's sent these.

215
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,076
They're celebrating Farah's engagement?

216
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:51,107
She's celebrating her brother's engagement.

217
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:54,657
Give some to her, too.

218
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,860
Hello?

219
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,173
Farah?

220
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,550
No, it's Lubna.

221
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,330
Farah's sleeping.

222
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,941
It's 10!

223
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,683
She went to bed at 8 a.m.

224
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:48,231
Ask her to call when she gets up.

225
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,641
Everything's alright, innit?

226
00:14:49,641 --> 00:14:50,682
I

227
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:54,231
Wanted my sister-in-law's number from her.

228
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:55,282
Sister-in-law?

229
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:59,062
I'm talking about Jasmine, Lubna.

230
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,731
Oh...

231
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,692
Mum's so eager to talk to her.

232
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,712
Wait, I'll wake her up.

233
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,491
No.

234
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,152
There's no hurry, really.

235
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,590
Let her sleep.

236
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,650
Stay on the line.

237
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,017
Perhaps it is time for her to get up.

238
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,296
Farah!

239
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,306
Farah!

240
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:24,196
Farah!

241
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,016
Aye -- Has the wedding procession gotten here?

242
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:27,246
Get a grip on your senses, Farah.

243
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:30,556
No wedding procession comes on engagements.

244
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:32,966
Here's some sweets for you.

245
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,167
From whom?

246
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,968
Afzal's family.

247
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,498
Arifa and her Mum are celebrating the engagement.

248
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,736
Arifa's on the line.

249
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:45,297
She wants her sister-in-law's cell number.

250
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,747
Sister-in-law?

251
00:15:46,747 --> 00:15:49,348
Jasmine, of course.

252
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,840
Here. Talk to her.

253
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,456
Hello, Arifa.

254
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,517
Peace be upon you.

255
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:01,907
And upon you, peace.

256
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,938
Sorry for waking you up.

257
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:04,818
No...

258
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:05,970
It's okay.

259
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,948
Ever since

260
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:09,769
Mum's found out, she's not calmed down.

261
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,812
She's been saying again and again, 'Get her number'.

262
00:16:12,812 --> 00:16:13,859
Ah, right...

263
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,640
I have her number.

264
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,758
Listen,

265
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,858
You've met her, haven't you?

266
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:20,419
Yes.

267
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,819
How does she look?

268
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,339
Also, tell me,

269
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,509
What does her voice sound like?

270
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:26,959
She sounds sweet, doesn't she?

271
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,559
Yes, she does.

272
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,750
She must look very comely.

273
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,300
She does.

274
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,941
I'd said the moment I'd heard it, 'She'd be very comely, Mum'!

275
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:40,141
As lively and jovial like a sparrow jigging about!

276
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:43,012
Give me her number, will you?

277
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,442
I'll text you.

278
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,763
And

279
00:16:46,763 --> 00:16:48,352
Have the sweets, too.

280
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,363
It's been sent specially for you.

281
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,955
I'll have some.

282
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:53,483
I'll disconnect.

283
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:55,315
Disconnect...

284
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,936
She was thumbing her nose at me.

285
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,266
She was saying everything herself,

286
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,597
'She's very comely, isn't she'?

287
00:17:04,597 --> 00:17:06,367
'Her voice would sound sweet, too'...

288
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,856
So, isn't she comely?

289
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:10,459
Doesn't she sound so sweet?

290
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,118
She may be.

291
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,849
She can talk to her and taste her sweetness for herself.

292
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,936
And look at that,

293
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,907
She's deriding me, saying,

294
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,406
'She'd be lively and jovial'

295
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,126
'Like a sparrow jigging about'!

296
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,218
If only the blighter knew she's a hawk!

297
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,097
At least text her the number.

298
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:30,908
I'm doing it.

299
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,467
Leave that be.

300
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:36,967
I won't have the sweets.

301
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,588
But I will.

302
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:41,968
I'm opening them for myself.

303
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,016
Hold it,

304
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:16,206
Hold it, Ruqaiyya Begum!

305
00:18:16,206 --> 00:18:19,816
He's not given you any such happiness,

306
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:23,419
That you feast on sweets to death.

307
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,489
You've already had half a kilogramme.

308
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:32,129
I'd thought your heart would be thunderstruck today.

309
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:35,919
It's your Afzal's engagement today,

310
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,760
And he hasn't even invited you!

311
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,421
Well, I do feel sad about that,

312
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,602
But my happiness is far greater, Reverend.

313
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,330
He'd have thought at least once,

314
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,336
But your judgement must've scared him...

315
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:58,380
Which judgement are you talking about?

316
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,120
You brand him a sinner just like that.

317
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,710
You'd be thundering right now

318
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,419
Had he invited us to his engagement.

319
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,550
'I won't attend that sinner's engagement'!

320
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,727
Have some shame, Ruqaiyya Begum.

321
00:19:10,727 --> 00:19:13,266
He didn't even ask you.

322
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,316
He picked a girl on his own,

323
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:19,430
And he's going to put the ring on her himself.

324
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,678
In all honesty,

325
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:27,327
This is cause enough for us to die of shame.

326
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:31,977
I'm thinking of writing a letter of disownment,

327
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:39,657
And having it published in every newspaper in Karachi before the evening.

328
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:40,936
Mum...

329
00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:42,485
I've gotten her number.

330
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:46,017
Whose number have you gotten?

331
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,466
My sister-in-law's.

332
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,347
Hello?

333
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,228
It's Jasmine, innit?

334
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:51,857
Yes; who are you?

335
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:53,520
I'm from Hyderabad.

336
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,368
Venture a guess

337
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:55,558
Who it could be.

338
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,278
Farah!

339
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,626
No...

340
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,396
This isn't Farah's voice.

341
00:21:00,396 --> 00:21:01,219
Yes,

342
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,730
It isn't Farah's voice.

343
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,462
Are you Afzal's sister,

344
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,203
Arifa?

345
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:08,103
Mum!

346
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:10,433
She's recognised me!

347
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,423
Give me the phone.

348
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,890
I'll talk to her.

349
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,296
Alright, tell me now,

350
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:18,310
Who am I?

351
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,600
Afzal's Mam.

352
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,460
There!

353
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,997
She's recognised me, too!

354
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,407
Honestly, my dear,

355
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,547
Do you have a special skill?

356
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:28,870
Is this knowledge because of your craft, or just guesswork?

357
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,110
I mean, I'd heard that ascetics can tell one's name from one's voice,

358
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,437
But never that lovers could be ascetics.

359
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:44,197
She's head over heels for Afzal!

360
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,191
Tell me, you're fair and comely, aren't you?

361
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,810
Come and see me.

362
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,620
How could I come when the rapscallion's not invited me...

363
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,693
It does sound like you are...

364
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,400
You're no less than Hyderabadis.

365
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,010
Let me talk to your Mum.

366
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,040
She's gone to the lapidary to get my jewellery polished.

367
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,746
She called the jeweller 'lapidary'.

368
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,966
She knows her English!

369
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,890
Who's there in your family besides your Mum?

370
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,938
Just my Mam and I.

371
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,600
Oh...

372
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,320
Didn't you ask him to bring his Mum and Dad along

373
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,740
If he's going to get engaged to you?

374
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,286
I did feel like saying that,

375
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:31,226
But I got scared.

376
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,448
Why were you scared?

377
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,147
I was scared that he may change his intentions.

378
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,647
Just let us get engaged,

379
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,887
I'll ask him after that.

380
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,236
In fact, I'll not say that;

381
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,889
I'd come over and bring Mam along.

382
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:46,890
You're saying that to make me happy, aren't you?

383
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,787
I like you this way.

384
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:51,307
Alright,

385
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:54,067
Talk to Arifa.

386
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,950
There's just the four of us over here,

387
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,917
My Mum,

388
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:58,600
Dad,

389
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,478
My brother, and I.

390
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:04,439
My brother's in Karachi, so take it

391
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,699
That there's 3 and 3 quarters of us.

392
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,690
3 and 3 quarters? How?

393
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:14,580
The three of us try our best to fill his absence through our memories of him.

394
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,130
That's why there's 3 and 3 quarters of us,

395
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,178
But not 4.

396
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,730
I've seen him somewhere.

397
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,248
It's

398
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:48,956
It's the same MP, innit,

399
00:23:48,956 --> 00:23:50,576
Who wears kurta-pyjamas,

400
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:54,036
And rides a bike to Parliament?

401
00:23:57,138 --> 00:24:00,779
What do I do with him?

402
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:02,269
You have to kill him.

403
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:05,172
He's an ace impostor.

404
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,473
He wears kurta-pyjamas and rides a bike to Parliament

405
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:11,834
To show the people.

406
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,460
I don't quite feel it's right.

407
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,596
Politicians today are great actors, M. Afzal.

408
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:21,273
They make one laugh

409
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,178
And cry as and when they want.

410
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:25,295
The people are so anguished

411
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:28,026
That sometimes, you can just see it.

412
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:30,258
The same anguish

413
00:24:30,258 --> 00:24:35,116
Echoes later in the citizens' cries.

414
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,506
Don't fall for his tricks.

415
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:44,406
One who can make others cry can also impress.

416
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,246
His performance doesn't end here.

417
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,426
He doesn't stay at the MPs' hostel.

418
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:56,600
He's rented a small apartment.

419
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,296
He doesn't pay his rent for two months,

420
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,736
And hears the most vile insults from the landlord.

421
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,777
Then,

422
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:07,350
What good is killing such a man?

423
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,147
He barks like dogs in Parliament.

424
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:14,207
He says to honourable ministers, 'You are all looting the nation's money',

425
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:17,517
'You are all traitors'.

426
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,337
We have intelligence that he's working on someone's orders.

427
00:25:22,337 --> 00:25:23,768
Whose orders?

428
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:25,567
Just think

429
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,686
That he's paid in Dollars to bark and insult.

430
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:32,576
Where does he keep the Dollars?

431
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:37,580
That's something we'd find out after he's dead.

432
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,220
One finds out about all the property owned by such people

433
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,880
When it's to be divided among their heirs.

434
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,691
And such people get elected to Parliament.

435
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:53,580
In this bag

436
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,306
Is 20 million in fresh notes.

437
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,596
Fresh.

438
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:03,406
All that's asked of you is that the murder should not look like one.

439
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:07,207
One can easily believe about such people

440
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:12,918
That, succumbing to mental illness, they've committed suicide.

441
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,270
What are you thinking?

442
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm thinking why one would pay 20 million to kill a pigeon.

443
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,040
So we're going to kill a pigeon?

444
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,500
It's a man...

445
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,266
But the bugger's a proper pigeon...

446
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,631
Mr Zaki!

447
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,001
Yes?

448
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,864
You have guests.

449
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:26,912
Have them sit; I'm coming.

450
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,855
Alright.

451
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,340
Peace be upon you.

452
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,230
And upon you, peace.

453
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,980
I'm sorry but I don't recognise you.

454
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,280
You don't seem to be from my constituency.

455
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,370
Do you recognise everyone from your constituency?

456
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,600
I don't recognise them by their names,

457
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,620
But I do, by their faces.

458
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,211
Pray tell what brings you here.

459
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,428
My name's Afzal.

460
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,661
Yes, Mr Afzal,

461
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,520
Pray tell

462
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,831
How I may be of help.

463
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:24,260
Be done with this act and tell me - who do you work for?

464
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,176
They don't let me work at all.

465
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,187
They stop me

466
00:28:28,187 --> 00:28:29,568
If I say something,

467
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,568
And scold me

468
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:31,627
When I start working.

469
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,600
Speak for yourself.

470
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,606
Tell me where you keep the Dollars.

471
00:28:35,606 --> 00:28:38,930
And who pays you Dollars to speak for him in Parliament?

472
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,590
I can take the Dollars, too, if I want.

473
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,810
But the thought of disgracing the Rupee scares me.

474
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,955
Who are you?

475
00:28:48,955 --> 00:28:51,116
Get in the car.

476
00:28:51,116 --> 00:28:52,856
Where'd you take me?

477
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,550
I'm sending you back.

478
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,310
Your time's up.

479
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,051
You could've come earlier.

480
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:01,942
I've been washing clothes for an hour.

481
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:03,711
Who'd wear them now?

482
00:29:03,711 --> 00:29:04,921
Come. Please.

483
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:05,931
Come.

484
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:08,542
Wait.

485
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,266
Sit.

486
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,117
Aren't you afraid?

487
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,027
I am, yes...

488
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:29,467
If you address someone my age

489
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,557
With such disrespect,

490
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:34,620
I might as well die of shame!

491
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,587
So, it's better

492
00:29:36,587 --> 00:29:38,607
That you do your job

493
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:42,058
Without all this insolence.

494
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,510
Tell me,

495
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:53,951
Why are they paying me 20 million to kill a twopenny man like you?

496
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,321
Go on.

497
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:02,301
If you address me so discourteously,

498
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,780
I won't answer.

499
00:30:10,182 --> 00:30:13,550
Alright, I won't be discourteous.

500
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,319
Why do they want you dead, sir?

501
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,610
And why are you not afraid to die?

502
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,430
I'd pursued an MA in Politics.

503
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,906
At University,

504
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,417
They'd stress

505
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:27,919
Every lesson about democracy.

506
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,456
'Democracy is the rule of the people',

507
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:32,020
'By the people',

508
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,187
'For the people'.

509
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:36,136
It touched my heart,

510
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,656
So, I entered politics.

511
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:41,397
I was an energetic orator.

512
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:42,717
I'd give

513
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:43,937
Vision to the people,

514
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:46,066
So, they fell for my tricks

515
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:50,210
And they elected me with a lead of 54,000 votes.

516
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:52,766
I entered Parliament, burdened

517
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:54,607
With my promises and vision.

518
00:30:54,607 --> 00:30:56,996
Only to find out soon enough

519
00:30:56,996 --> 00:31:00,037
That the definition of democracy I'd studied

520
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:03,048
Was incorrect.

521
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:04,407
The correct one is,

522
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:06,747
'Democracy is the rule of the feudals',

523
00:31:06,747 --> 00:31:07,848
'By the feudals',

524
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:09,929
'And for the feudals'.

525
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:13,140
The academic definition of Parliament is one thing --

526
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,701
Well, it isn't really relevant to you.

527
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,910
You've gotten your 20 million,

528
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,611
So, do your job,

529
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,440
And have a jolly good time.

530
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,150
Even if I 'earn' 20 million,

531
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,130
I don't 'have a 'jolly good time', Mr Zaki.

532
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,137
Then, distribute your 20 million

533
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,940
Among the people of my constituency.

534
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,126
By the Lord,

535
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:35,170
I'd commit suicide before you return.

536
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,927
It'd do your job,

537
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,106
And remove a thorn in their side.

538
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,558
And this will just be an excuse

539
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,219
To ease the pain of the those fools, the people of my constituency.

540
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:48,350
Otherwise, I'm usually sitting here, cowering,

541
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,571
Worried about how I'd face them.

542
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,396
Please get in the car.

543
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,106
I said, please get in the car.

544
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,916
Come.

545
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,407
Please, follow me.

546
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,546
Take a seat.

547
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,676
There's 20 million in fresh notes in it.

548
00:33:30,846 --> 00:33:34,545
Get in my car and go to your constituency from here,

549
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:38,120
And distribute this 20 million among 'those fools'

550
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,980
Who'd trusted your vision.

551
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,390
And sleep peacefully when you return,

552
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,981
And roar on in Parliament tomorrow, assured

553
00:33:52,981 --> 00:34:00,182
That nobody can dare touch you as long as I'm alive.

554
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:03,243
Who are you, my good sir?

555
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm another one of 'those fools' who'd been waiting for 66 years for a leader who'd wash their own clothes,

556
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:20,980
And humbly listen to the landlord's insults for nor paying the rent for two months.

557
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,110
Don't call me 'my good sir' if we meet again.

558
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:31,591
I'd feel that you've accorded me respect if you just call me 'my good man'.

559
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,850
This bag's rather heavy.

560
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,990
You'll need help lifting it.

561
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,770
So, I'm sending someone along.

562
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,327
Timmy!

563
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:48,728
Take this bag and put it in one of our cars,

564
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:53,236
And ask the driver to stay with him.

565
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,608
'Democracy is the rule of the people',

566
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,551
'For the people',

567
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,561
'By the people'.

568
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,770
Thank you.

569
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,167
Is it done?

570
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,306
We've begun.

571
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,676
It'll be done in a few years.

572
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:50,096
No, M. Afzal, we just have 72 hours.

573
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:54,520
Those who've been kind to you don't even have 4 hours, sir.

574
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,070
Please, tell them

575
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,230
That if there's so much as a crease on Zaki Ahmed's pyjamas because of them,

576
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,666
I'll round them all up in a coffin.

577
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,156
I'll disconnect.

578
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:13,476
B --
-You can try me if you have any doubts.

579
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,950
The Lord's willed it [praise]!

580
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,760
May the evil gaze not touch you.

581
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,426
You look so sweet!

582
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:42,916
May the Lord protect you from every evil eye.

583
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,850
When would he be here?

584
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,800
After the dusk prayer.

585
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,700
Alright.

586
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,470
C'mon.

587
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,506
Sit.

588
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:53,480
Come, all of you.

589
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,646
Why don't you all take a seat?

590
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,810
They're here!

591
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,868
His Dad's dancing, too!

592
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,969
Do you know why he's dancing?

593
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,009
Because we've had dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] made!

594
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,990
So we're serving dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] today?

595
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,000
We aren't serving <i>just</i> dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice].</i>

596
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,850
It's just that we're serving dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] too!

597
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,177
Haven't they come?

598
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:38,598
They've all come.

599
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:40,291
And he looks very dashing.

600
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,512
I'm not talking about <i>him</i>.</i>

601
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,723
I'm talking about Arifa and the others.

602
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,293
They've not come yet.

603
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:48,824
Perhaps they've had a change of heart at the last moment?

604
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,654
Hey!

605
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,856
Call Arifa.

606
00:38:52,856 --> 00:38:54,840
Now's not the time to call.

607
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,720
They'd come here if they want, or stay at home.

608
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,007
I'll get going!

609
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,330
Quickly, now,

610
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,030
Be done with it already. The dusk prayer was quite a while ago!

611
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,186
Yes; just two more minutes.

612
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:37,890
Your two minutes have been going on for the last 15 minutes.

613
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,946
Go and see if Arifa's ready.

614
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:43,820
I'll be ready by the time she is.

615
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,600
Dad...

616
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Here she is.

617
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,640
Here she is. You'd better come, now, too.

618
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,470
Here she is. You'd better come, now, too.
-Yes.

619
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,456
Take this, Dad.

620
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:53,367
Give this ring to her.

621
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,780
It's of no use to us now.

622
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,970
Whatever would she do with it, either?

623
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,176
Don't worry.

624
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:06,017
She'd only wear this one.

625
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:07,527
Let him know, too,

626
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:12,837
That the ring's gone up to her hand.

627
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,000
Alright, come.

628
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
