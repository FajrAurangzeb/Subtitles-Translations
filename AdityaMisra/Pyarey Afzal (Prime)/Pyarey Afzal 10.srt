1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,849
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:19,153
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:24,190
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,608
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,178
Sit down.

8
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,274
Have your breakfast. I'll get it.

9
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,660
I'll get it myself.

10
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,211
Come on, my good man,

11
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,129
Sit; Have your breakfast.

12
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,759
She'll get the phone for you.

13
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,319
Why are you ringing with the phone?

14
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,090
Bring it, my dear.

15
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,259
It's Farah.

16
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,149
I know you won't say anything

17
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,669
But that's okay. As long as you listen carefully.

18
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,823
You'll be invited to dinner tonight.

19
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:06,804
You'll be delighted to hear this,

20
00:02:06,804 --> 00:02:08,633
But don't use 'Don't worry'

21
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,800
When acting out your delight.

22
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,594
Say as soon as you get the invitation,

23
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:13,580
'Thank you, sir'.

24
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,791
'I'll be there on time'.

25
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:18,430
Are you listening?

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,110
Well,

27
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,234
You would be.

28
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,360
Next,

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,470
You won't come to dinner tonight.

30
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,559
At 9.15, I'll call you, worried,

31
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,103
Asking you

32
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,064
Why you're not coming.

33
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,570
Hang up the moment I call you.

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,418
I mean

35
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,065
No response.

36
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:35,172
Then,

37
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,393
You will keep your phone switched off until 9 a.m. tomorrow.

38
00:02:38,393 --> 00:02:40,354
At 9.01 tomorrow,

39
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:42,189
I'll talk to you again.

40
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,397
I'll tell you then

41
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,845
What you're supposed to do next.

42
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,050
Here.

43
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,625
It got disconnected.

44
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,261
Alright.

45
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,116
Have a look and see who called you.

46
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,854
Must be a friend.

47
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:15,652
After all, it's Sunday.

48
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:18,760
Someone must be calling me to play cricket.

49
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,240
This is the good type of cricket, isn't it?

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,872
Yes.

51
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,166
When will you have your breakfast?

52
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,136
We will.

53
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,567
Monseigneur's asking.

54
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:44,279
About

55
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,473
15 minutes from now?

56
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,082
Did that gag you?

57
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,388
This is called crisis management.

58
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:53,891
I figured last night

59
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,293
If he came today,

60
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,447
As you said he would,

61
00:03:57,447 --> 00:04:00,180
His parents would be invited in a few days.

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,527
That starts a chain reaction, now, doesn't it?

63
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,949
Plus, our Dad

64
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,860
Is such a quick decision-maker!

65
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,958
One of these meetings, he'd call me,

66
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,848
Have me sit before the Reverend,

67
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:11,830
And say,

68
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,120
'Here, Reverend'!

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,476
'Begin in God's name, and put the ring on her'!

70
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,888
He'll begin in God's name,

71
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:18,262
And I'll begin a monody!

72
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:19,103
And there

73
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,777
I'd be gone for good, Lubna!

74
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:21,920
Out of Mehtab

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,950
Into Afzal!

76
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:32,680
Why aren't you saying anything?

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,281
At least appreciate me!

78
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:40,279
I am appreciating you.

79
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,540
So far, it's happened as you thought it would.

80
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,660
So it has been.

81
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,120
And so, fear God, Farah Ibrahim!

82
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,270
Only He has such power.

83
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,108
He says, 'Be', and it is.

84
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,760
You're bent upon scaring me!

85
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,747
Your crisis management will be tested

86
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:02,049
When something unprecedented will happen!

87
00:05:02,049 --> 00:05:03,533
Like what?

88
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,148
No idea.

89
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:07,091
But I have a hunch

90
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,633
The Lord suddenly stops

91
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:11,734
A person from becoming a god himself!

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,527
Hello?

93
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,488
Am I talking to Afzal?

94
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:42,489
Yes. It's me.

95
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,760
You --?

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,313
This is Sheikh Ibrahim speaking.

97
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,058
Yes --

98
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:49,181
Sir, I recognised your voice.

99
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:50,766
Peace be upon you, sir.

100
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,707
And upon you, peace.

101
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,597
How are you, my good man?

102
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:56,263
I'm good.

103
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:57,686
Fine.

104
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:01,017
It feels like you're lying when you say 'fine'.

105
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,176
Not at all, sir.

106
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:03,913
I don't lie very often.

107
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:05,700
In fact, I used to,

108
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,051
But not at all now.

109
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,941
Alright. Tell me you're not busy in the evening?

110
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:12,934
No.

111
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,412
Not at all.

112
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,134
Can you meet me at 9?

113
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:18,155
Of course I can, sir.

114
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:21,645
Alright then, we'll meet at 9 for dinner at my house.

115
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,007
Sharp at 9 o'clock.

116
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,449
Right, sir.

117
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:28,440
Shall I send a car at a quarter to 9?

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,450
No, sir.

119
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,824
It's just about two furlongs.

120
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:32,889
I'll be there

121
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,914
If I just sauntered down the road.

122
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,994
If it rains, if you get drenched,

123
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,899
Come regardless.

124
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,162
I will, sir.

125
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,656
You don't worry.

126
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,699
Okay; Bye.

127
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,508
Hello?

128
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:02,414
Did you get the invitation?

129
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:03,440
I did.

130
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Then do as you've been told.

131
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,029
You don't worry.

132
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,807
Leave it to me.

133
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,730
I hope you remember everything?

134
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,062
Of course.

135
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,343
Alright; tell me,

136
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:16,141
Why don't you say anything

137
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,635
When Farah calls you?

138
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,064
I can't bring myself

139
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:24,567
To say something to her.

140
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,326
It's gotten too far, Mum.

141
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,422
He's going to their place for dinner tonight.

142
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:41,590
Where?

143
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,615
To <i>her</i> place!</i>

144
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,660
But there's one thing I don't get.

145
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,657
The younger sister's inviting him, and the elder sister's stopping him!

146
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:50,898
What do you mean?

147
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:53,042
I mean, the elder sister's a tad haughty

148
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,480
And so, she's throwing a spanner in the works.

149
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,250
Only God knows what you're saying and what you want to tell!

150
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,613
Stay tuned

151
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,548
For one breaking news after another.

152
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,468
Get a few new gowns ready.

153
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,200
And

154
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,679
Send the jewellery you've kept in the chest for polishing.

155
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,372
I'm auguring a gathering one of these days.

156
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:13,171
There, now!

157
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:18,681
It's not as if he'd want to be handfasted to any Mary, Jane or Susie and the Reverend will say, 'Praise the Lord'! [=Subhanallah]

158
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,539
'Get ready and come with me, Ruqaiyya',

159
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,207
'I bear glad tidings that we've found a daughter-in-law'.
-She's no Mary, Jane or Susie.

160
00:08:24,207 --> 00:08:27,867
You'd be awestruck to hear about her!

161
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,642
You'd turn to look at your Afzal over and over,

162
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,739
Repeating,

163
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,950
'The blighter's hit a jackpot'!

164
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,400
Fear God, Arifa, you're calling your elder brother a blighter!

165
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I was just --

166
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,035
Saying it as you!

167
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:41,400
You do say it now and then.

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,986
So what if I say it?

169
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,017
It's rather rude.

170
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,478
Take these away for washing.

171
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,448
Stop him!

172
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,475
Hey --

173
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,641
Stop!
-Leave him!

174
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:07,199
Step a--
-Why are you beating him?

175
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:11,109
The bugger borrowed a hundred thousand for one day!

176
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,024
And now he says he'll return it next month!

177
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:16,470
Why don't you step aside?
-Halt!

178
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,454
As if this would solve anything!

179
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,261
Did you borrow a hundred thousand?

180
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,874
Yes.

181
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:31,282
What did you do with it?

182
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,015
Lost it in a match.

183
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,890
Will you get your money back if you batter him?
-Even his ol' man would give me the money!

184
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,830
Don't bring in his old man.

185
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,808
He won't give you a penny.

186
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:53,795
Stop playing old man [=guardian] to him and step aside!
-Hey!

187
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,985
I'll get my money at all costs!

188
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,682
I know how to lend,

189
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:00,279
And I know bloody well how to collect!
-Take his money, then, not his life!

190
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,290
Will you give me the money?
-I'll give you.

191
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,343
Oh?

192
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:04,887
So you'll give me the money.

193
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:05,858
Yes.

194
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:07,895
Take your money from Sajid at 8 p.m.

195
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:09,645
8 p.m. means 8 p.m.

196
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,725
Rest assured; I mean it when I said it.

197
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,341
You'll get your money.

198
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,064
Make yourself scarce now.

199
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:18,140
I'll deduct 2,000 Rupees if I saw your face before 8.

200
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,711
Go!

201
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,582
Begone, you bugger!

202
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,589
Thank you, mate!

203
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,235
Thank you very much.

204
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,972
Mr 'Thank you'!

205
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,151
Pull out 2,000.

206
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:33,850
2,000?

207
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,086
I've got 98,000.

208
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,099
So,

209
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,680
You'd actually give him a hundred thousand?

210
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,314
I'll have to give him the money now that I've given him my word.

211
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:46,398
Now, give me 2,000.

212
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,774
Take all of it!

213
00:10:50,774 --> 00:10:52,588
I don't want all of it, mate!

214
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,290
Just 2,000.

215
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,846
Here.

216
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,613
And make yourself scarce 'round here.

217
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,784
If Dad saw you,

218
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:04,432
You'd be deemed worthy of being murdered [the ultimate sinner]! Go, now.

219
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,041
Alright, then.

220
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,494
Tell your father that Babloo

221
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,920
Will never gamble again.

222
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,161
I swear by you.

223
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,938
What's this?

224
00:12:45,938 --> 00:12:48,894
I'm thinking of what I'd wear tonight.

225
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,265
Splendid!

226
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,727
You're so serious

227
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,542
As if he's <i>actually</i> coming tonight!</i>

228
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,401
Why don't you tell Mum too?

229
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,692
She's preparing some cates for real!

230
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:01,927
You daft demoiselle,

231
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:05,214
One's got to prepare to act or act to prepare.

232
00:13:05,214 --> 00:13:07,363
And you must stand out from all of us

233
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:08,483
Full of colours!

234
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,264
Lost, dreaming of someone,

235
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,554
Dressed to impress!

236
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:13,957
What?

237
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,435
How else would Dad know

238
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:19,097
That you're delighted he's coming?

239
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,357
Forget for now

240
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,262
That you've asked him not to come.

241
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,659
Imagine he's coming

242
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,120
He'll come,

243
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,463
And the wait drives you mad:

244
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:28,916
Eyeing the clock every so often,

245
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,613
Checking your makeup in the mirror,

246
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,361
In fact, even if you don't need it,

247
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:35,906
Retouch your makeup just to show Mum!

248
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,579
Turn away

249
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:39,961
If your gaze falls on Dad,

250
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,637
Act coy and move aside.

251
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:44,590
That's what it'll take to work.

252
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,157
What'll work?

253
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:49,620
It's strange

254
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,718
That you've hatched up this plan and I'm filling you in on the details!

255
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:54,140
Tell me.

256
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,390
Look, sweet damsel,

257
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,009
When he doesn't show up at 9,

258
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,316
And switches off his phone at 9.15,

259
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,215
Won't Dad redden with rage?

260
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,948
And seeing your preparations will only add fuel to his fiery fury!

261
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:05,920
Sure will!

262
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,755
Then, instead of saying yes to him, Dad will say to you,

263
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,035
'Think again, girl',

264
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:12,464
'You've still got time'.

265
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,557
Thoroughly take your time.

266
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:16,539
4, 6 or even 10 or more months maybe,

267
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,876
Or even a year or two if you will!

268
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,560
And then, say to him,

269
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,500
'Dad',

270
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,315
'I've realised my mistake'.

271
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:26,110
'Afzal's not the right type'.

272
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,765
Then?

273
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:28,588
What, then?

274
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:31,718
You've been bailed out of Mehtab, and Afzal will fall like a house of cards.

275
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,643
Pack your bags for London!

276
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,270
Where are you off to?

277
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,990
Let me see, too,

278
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,039
What I'll wear tonight!

279
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,758
Here.

280
00:15:02,758 --> 00:15:04,486
Here's your suit.

281
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,607
Thank you!

282
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,325
Thank God I got there on time!

283
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:13,828
The bleedin' laundryman

284
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:15,832
Had bundled your suit with your Dad's clothes

285
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,130
To send it to your house!

286
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,074
Whoa!

287
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:20,980
And thank your Dad too

288
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,795
For he said the moment he saw it,

289
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:25,497
'This suit isn't Afzal's'!

290
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:27,066
Dad was there too?

291
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:28,596
He'd just arrived.

292
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:31,552
I greeted him and skedaddled!

293
00:15:32,151 --> 00:15:32,896
Good.

294
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,446
Going there again, right?

295
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:35,883
Yes.

296
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:38,126
You'd wear the same suit today?

297
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:40,973
Is this your suit or your uniform?

298
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,690
I'd gotten all drenched in the rain that day

299
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,416
I couldn't show it off.

300
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,780
I will today!

301
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:50,686
When I'd purchased this,

302
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,922
<i>She</i> liked it.</i>

303
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,651
I hope you're very happy!

304
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:16,776
Let me tell you in advance that your father's going to say yes to him!

305
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,767
Hey!

306
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,728
Why are you so agitated?

307
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:24,221
Not at all!

308
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:25,700
She's not agitated...

309
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,256
She's just a bit demure...

310
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:29,171
Anyway,

311
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,000
This isn't how you look demure!

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,639
C'mon!

313
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,184
Here.

314
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,627
Would you look here!

315
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,451
How sweet she looks!

316
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,840
But why isn't he here yet?

317
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,141
It may be that he's a few minutes late...

318
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,107
How come?

319
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,623
I'd asked him to be here sharp at 9 o'clock!

320
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,589
Should I call him, Dad?

321
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,580
Let me...

322
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,431
Right,

323
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,778
Where are you, my good man?

324
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,319
Okay.

325
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,255
He isn't coming?

326
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,834
Why not?

327
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:35,111
Go and get him inside; he's at our doorstep.

328
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,743
It was still 10 seconds to 9

329
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,450
When I was at your doorstep.

330
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,016
Your father called the moment I thought I'd ring the bell.

331
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,646
I hope I look good?

332
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,410
Your father thunders when he speaks!

333
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,133
The first thing he said was, 'Where are you, my good man'?

334
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,185
I greeted him in a moment,

335
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,936
And he quietened.

336
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:15,568
I'd called to ask you if you remembered everything

337
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:18,522
And you'd replied, 'You don't worry'.

338
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,723
Yes?

339
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,666
So did we ask you to do <i>this</i>?</i>

340
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,877
Come in now.

341
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,270
Peace be upon you, Uncle.

342
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,065
And upon you, peace.

343
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,178
You're looking handsome!

344
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,050
Thank you, sir.

345
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:53,152
Peace, Aunt.

346
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,002
And upon you, peace.

347
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,190
How are you?

348
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,540
I'm fine.

349
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,993
Sit.

350
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,787
After you.

351
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,577
I have some other chores to see to,

352
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,920
Sit here and talk to Uncle for now.

353
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,500
Please, sit.
-Alright.

354
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,055
Thank you.

355
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,990
And why are <i>you</i> sitting here?</i>

356
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,297
Come with me

357
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,440
And sit with Farah.

358
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,942
At ease.

359
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:33,938
I won't ask you anything that will require you to strain your mind for no reason.

360
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,150
Why is he here?

361
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,052
He doesn't know either.

362
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:58,060
The blighter!

363
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,776
I won't give him one penny!

364
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,575
He doesn't need the money anymore.

365
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,504
For he'll be getting you along with everything in your bank account!

366
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:07,060
Shut your gob!

367
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,931
It's more than his face is worth!
-Don't talk about his face.

368
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:12,654
The rapscallion looks so dashing!

369
00:20:12,654 --> 00:20:15,646
He's wearing the same black suit again.

370
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,847
What are your ambitions?

371
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:33,241
Have you ever thought what you'd do, what you'd become?

372
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,917
Not at all.

373
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:37,691
But I'm looking for a job, sir.

374
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:40,811
I haven't told Dad that I've been ousted from the old one.

375
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,341
Hasn't he found out?

376
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:47,667
How would he when I haven't told him, sir?

377
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,511
I leave every morning as if going to my office,

378
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,696
And come back in the evening.

379
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:57,723
Dad thinks I'm coming back from the office.

380
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,956
But I'm

381
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,892
Trying, sir.

382
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,400
Thank goodness I haven't told him.

383
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
Thank you very much, sir.

384
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,970
Have you ever thought about the status

385
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,724
Of the one you love?

386
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,968
How she spends her life?

387
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,726
Why?

388
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,103
I've never been able to bring myself to believe

389
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:29,724
That I could ever get married to her.

390
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:32,914
Has she never asked you either?

391
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:36,633
She must have told you not to gamble on matches!

392
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,340
No.

393
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,310
So she says you can?

394
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,156
She doesn't say that either.

395
00:21:42,156 --> 00:21:44,180
Surely, you aren't nervous?

396
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,202
Not at all.

397
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:51,860
Imagine, I accept your marriage to her,

398
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,640
And in four months, you do, indeed, get married to her.

399
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,397
What will you do then?

400
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:59,008
What are your career prospects?

401
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:04,878
What are your ambitions that I can trust to assure me that you'll be able to keep her happy?

402
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:07,542
One doesn't trust career prospects, sir;

403
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,824
It is the man whom one trusts.

404
00:22:10,824 --> 00:22:13,368
And I have full confidence in myself.

405
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,180
I'll earn to be able to feed her.

406
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,986
I'll do everything I can to keep her happy.

407
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,317
At first, I couldn't believe it, Farah!

408
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:46,540
I couldn't bring myself to accept that he's here!

409
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,614
And there he was, at the door, smiling shamelessly!

410
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,687
How you'd repeated everything to him

411
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,920
That he should say when he's invited, 'I'll be there',

412
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,336
But he's not to come!

413
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,402
And yes

414
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:01,306
You'd also said to him,

415
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:04,736
'Switch off your phone at 9.15'!

416
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,953
What good will it do to remember this?

417
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,776
Who's thinking of any good?

418
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,158
I'm just estimating

419
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,510
The potential damage!

420
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:14,877
Shut up!

421
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,508
Splendid!

422
00:23:16,508 --> 00:23:18,783
It's killing me to worry about you,

423
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:20,840
And you're saying 'Shut up'!

424
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,434
Alright, I will shut up!

425
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,047
But listen to one final thing

426
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:27,969
You'll be cursed by that blighter Mehtab!

427
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:31,012
Where are you going?

428
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:32,886
Just --

429
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:34,421
I'll take a stroll around the house.

430
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,351
It's better that I ask when we'd have dinner

431
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:38,983
Than sit by your side quietly!

432
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,990
You're concerned about the food, Lubna!

433
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,992
So should I stop eating too?

434
00:23:42,992 --> 00:23:44,363
Just because

435
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:47,341
He showed up despite orders not to!

436
00:23:47,341 --> 00:23:48,925
And why are you worrying?

437
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:51,720
What happened to your 'crisis management'?

438
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,002
Now that he's here,

439
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:53,975
Just take it as if --

440
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,888
Imagine, rather, you've called him here yourself!

441
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,573
Meet him like you'd meet a dolor non grata -

442
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,616
Beckon to it, give it a place in your heart,

443
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:05,995
And then say to it, 'To the dickens with you'!

444
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,464
To the dickens with you!

445
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,421
And if I told you that your marriage to Farah isn't possible,

446
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:33,116
How would you react?

447
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,626
I wouldn't react, sir.

448
00:24:40,205 --> 00:24:41,749
Why?

449
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:43,776
Won't you feel sorrow?

450
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,839
It didn't seem likely I'd say yes after today's meeting.

451
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,911
Surely, I would feel sorrow, sir,

452
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:53,585
But I've come here with the firm belief that I don't deserve her.

453
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:56,764
I've got nothing, sir.

454
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,820
Just dreams...

455
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,306
But no reason to believe they'd ever come true.

456
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:07,613
I do say that I'd do everything I can do keep her happy,

457
00:25:07,613 --> 00:25:11,910
But how long will I keep trying; how long she'd be happy with me...

458
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:16,452
The truth, sir, is that I don't even come up to Dad's expectations.

459
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:19,353
And you're <i>her</i> father.</i>

460
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,357
You're getting nervous, aren't you?

461
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:30,749
Not at all.

462
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:32,090
Then why don't you say

463
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,712
'I'd react if you reject me'?

464
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:37,211
'I'll take a stand against everyone for her'!

465
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,960
Because I never would, sir.

466
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,177
Even for her, I'd never take a stand against her father.

467
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:46,980
I can take a stand against everyone else.

468
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,737
How many suits do you have like this one?

469
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,260
Just this one, sir.

470
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,003
It's nice.

471
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:04,107
It suits you.

472
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,149
Thank you, sir.

473
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,440
Wear this one when you come tomorrow.

474
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,735
Come where, sir?

475
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,392
To office.

476
00:26:11,392 --> 00:26:14,105
Sharp at 9 o'clock.

477
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,919
The same as you do everyday.

478
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,068
Right, sir.

479
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,714
I'll be there at 9.

480
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,661
Don't say anything!

481
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:13,018
I found out before you entered this room.

482
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:15,500
You bring bad tidings.

483
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,401
Okay.

484
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,148
Just hear as much

485
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:20,390
That the meeting's over,

486
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,900
And it's time for dinner.

487
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,380
Retouch your makeup

488
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,998
And get to the dining room, double time!

489
00:27:25,998 --> 00:27:28,609
It's quite possible that the moment you get there,

490
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:32,871
Dad will announce his surrender before your love!

491
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,446
Your father says Arifa would know where he is.

492
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,522
Dad's right...

493
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:06,620
When will he be back?

494
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,458
He would, soon enough.

495
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,836
An hour at the most?

496
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,159
I can swear to you

497
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,480
I won't even mention it to your father,

498
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,478
But at least tell me

499
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:24,901
Where he's gone

500
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,105
And who she is.

501
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:30,519
Ask all you will about her looks, and I will tell you.

502
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,550
But I won't tell you her name without his permission.

503
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,531
Just pray that he succeeds today!

504
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:43,940
I won't pray before I hear her name.

505
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,535
Well,

506
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,303
Love doesn't need prayers.

507
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:50,294
Why doesn't it?

508
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,896
Oh?

509
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,882
Wouldn't Majnun's mother have prayed for him?

510
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:58,050
And Ranjha's mother, I've heard, died in his childhood.

511
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,440
But Punnun and Farhad's mothers were fine.

512
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,883
Did their prayers work?

513
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,824
They didn't, did they?

514
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:09,300
So has my Afzal become Majnun [ = crazed in love]?

515
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,420
Speak something good, would you?

516
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,300
Let your mouth utter only good things.

517
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,779
Don't look at how their love ended, Mum.

518
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,384
Look at their place.

519
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,544
The poor ones died in the absence of a second option,

520
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:24,780
Else the legends would be talking about their children too!

521
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,630
Don't worry, Mum.

522
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,058
You Afzal will be the most excellent ['Afzal'] of them all!

523
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,543
How do you eat at home?

524
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,670
Dad says

525
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,270
One should eat with one's hands, so that's how...

526
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,623
So eat with your hands.

527
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,760
It's no good acting coy and running away now.

528
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,142
Sit.

529
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,194
Why don't you eat, my dear?

530
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,620
Why did you stop?

531
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,181
Sure.

532
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,231
I'm sorry, Dad...

533
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,193
But please don't proclaim any decision just yet.

534
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,261
I want to talk to Afzal about something.

535
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,714
Just for ten minutes?

536
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:08,372
And Lubna will be with me.

537
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,543
Please?

538
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:15,808
Okay.

539
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,300
I have no objections.

540
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,380
Talk to him about it.

541
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,610
Thank you, Dad.

542
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,356
Would you be done with it quickly?

543
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,261
Should I

544
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:23,269
Keep standing, or may I sit?

545
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,512
Sit!

546
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,005
You'd said

547
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:45,159
You won't come.

548
00:33:45,962 --> 00:33:48,360
Who -- When?

549
00:33:49,504 --> 00:33:51,457
So you're acting here as well?

550
00:33:51,457 --> 00:33:53,337
You loafer!

551
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,460
I'd said it.

552
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,827
I'd called you myself!

553
00:33:56,827 --> 00:34:00,648
I'd repeated everything to you to make it clear!

554
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,665
No you didn't?

555
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:06,951
No as in?

556
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,230
You didn't call me.

557
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,866
You didn't explain anything.

558
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,457
Would you look at that!

559
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:17,651
How he can look me in the eyes and lie to me!

560
00:34:17,651 --> 00:34:20,240
I didn't look you in the eyes...

561
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,573
Didn't lie either.

562
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,848
Farah had called before my eyes

563
00:34:24,848 --> 00:34:26,149
Using my cell phone.

564
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,278
She was explaining everything elaborately!

565
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:32,942
I was listening to it here as you were over there!
-By the Lord, no!

566
00:34:33,165 --> 00:34:35,958
I didn't hear a word of it!

567
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,696
He's telling the truth.

568
00:34:45,696 --> 00:34:48,113
He's swearing by God.

569
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,642
So was I

570
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:52,507
Talking to my angels?

571
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,742
What's the matter?

572
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,629
I mean

573
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,108
Did you ask me not to come?

574
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:03,470
Exactly.

575
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,369
Good Lord!

576
00:35:06,842 --> 00:35:08,996
But who answered the phone, then?

577
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,382
Who did you talk to?

578
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:11,795
Did I say anything?

579
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:15,400
Have you <i>ever</i> said anything?</i>

580
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,773
You quieten the moment you hear my voice!

581
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:20,065
You don't even say a 'yes' or 'okay'!

582
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:22,833
I do wish you peace [greetings].

583
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,749
What do I do now?

584
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,749
What did Dad say?

585
00:35:31,749 --> 00:35:33,880
He's called me to the office tomorrow.

586
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,030
He said he'll meet me there.

587
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,750
You won't go there.

588
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,320
How can that be?

589
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,531
How could I disobey him?
-How could you disobey <i>me</i>?</i>

590
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:45,904
You're serving me for 200,000 a month!

591
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:50,080
But you'd said the designation is a grand one!

592
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,069
She's calling me a servant!

593
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:56,140
<i>You</i>'re worried about your designation?</i>

594
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,930
Hold your horses, Farah.

595
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,484
Care to tell me

596
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:04,158
What you'd do if Dad proclaimed his decision of getting the two of you married?

597
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:06,454
What could I do in that case?

598
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:09,239
So you'd marry me, eh?

599
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,864
No, I didn't quite say <i>that</i>.
-You're just being naïve, Farah.</i>

600
00:36:12,864 --> 00:36:15,668
He isn't here to get married to you.

601
00:36:15,668 --> 00:36:16,948
Just tell me

602
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:19,121
Do you have a way out if that happens?

603
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:22,393
My brain's paralysed, Lubna!

604
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,683
You'll see in a while

605
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,207
As my heart stops beating too!

606
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:27,074
Don't get all worked up like that.

607
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:29,230
Let Dad proclaim his decision.

608
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,226
What?

609
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:32,080
He won't just proclaim his decision,

610
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,857
He'd kiss him as his own, and seat him on the exalted throne of his son-in-law!

611
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:37,244
What will I do then?

612
00:36:37,244 --> 00:36:38,773
And what will <i>he</i> do then?</i>

613
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:40,795
Two-time you?

614
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,008
That's what we'd decided, right?

615
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:50,979
He'd act to love you from the depths of his heart, and then break yours.

616
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
Right!

617
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,155
I completely forgot!

618
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:05,767
And it isn't my fault either.

619
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:09,993
After Mehtab's chapter closed, I'd begun to think

620
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:14,041
He, too, should do his job, take his money, and get going!

621
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:15,662
Look,

622
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:18,040
Four months of acting is something that neither I can do, nor he.

623
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,512
I can.

624
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:21,074
What can you do?

625
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,385
I mean,

626
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,776
I'll show my love

627
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,483
As long as it's necessary.

628
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:29,633
And when it's required that I be perfidious,

629
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,644
I would be perfidious.

630
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:33,423
Do it tomorrow.

631
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:34,700
Splendid.

632
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,180
Dad will say yes today,

633
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,496
And he'd two-time you tomorrow!

634
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:41,331
Don't you think it's too early?

635
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,334
Ten minutes have passed.

636
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,070
Come, Mademoiselle.

637
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,255
Monseigneur says it's been ten minutes.

638
00:38:08,255 --> 00:38:10,118
Alright.

639
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:11,509
Listen.

640
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,000
If Dad talks about the marriage,

641
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,884
Say,

642
00:38:13,884 --> 00:38:14,982
'Alright, thank you'.

643
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:16,999
Don't say anything else.

644
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:17,959
I won't.

645
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,259
And if he said,

646
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,383
'Bring your parents one of these days',

647
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:23,415
What would you say then?

648
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,360
I'd say, 'Alright'.

649
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,233
'Thank you'.

650
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,909
Are you nuts?

651
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,809
Don't you dare talk to them

652
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,973
Or bring them here!

653
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:33,782
No -- I won't.

654
00:38:33,782 --> 00:38:35,392
I'd say, 'They can't come'.

655
00:38:35,392 --> 00:38:37,384
'T -- Talk to me'.

656
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:38,918
Talk to you about what?

657
00:38:38,918 --> 00:38:42,286
And why talk to <i>you</i> about the marriage?</i>

658
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:45,325
What should I tell Monseigneur?

659
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,377
Tell him we're coming in ten minutes.

660
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,628
Alright, listen.

661
00:38:48,628 --> 00:38:50,781
You don't need to get nervous.

662
00:38:50,781 --> 00:38:52,579
Stand firm with your love for now,

663
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:54,820
We'll schedule your -- perfidy -- later.

664
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,950
Come with me, now.

665
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,932
Okay?

666
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:57,940
C'mon!

667
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,360
Come.

668
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
