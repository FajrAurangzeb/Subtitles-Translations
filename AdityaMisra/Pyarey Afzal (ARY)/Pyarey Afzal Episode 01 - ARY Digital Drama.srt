1
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:13,945
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:18,835
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:24,245
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:30,395
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:36,042
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:41,005
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,586
What are you doing?

8
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,116
Did you see his speed?

9
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,686
Then play accordingly!

10
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,035
Umpire Sir!

11
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:48,585
Call from my family!

12
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:49,929
Hello --

13
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,453
Misbah hit two sixes?

14
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:56,283
The wretch who couldn't hit a six on a hundred balls scored two sixes on two balls?

15
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,884
India will win this. India will win.

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,800
Raise the stakes.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,250
I'm losing 7,000 elsewhere.

18
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,587
Alright, I'll pay you 7,000.

19
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,117
Bugger!

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,559
One minute!

21
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:47,447
Mate... Make it 8,000, will you?

22
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,337
It'll save you two and earn me one.

23
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:50,667
I'm facing a loss elsewhere.

24
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,288
I won't!

25
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,320
Come here! Here!

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,590
No, back -- go back -- there

27
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,462
Alright, I'll pay you 8,500.

28
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:42,493
But you're paying me 5,000 if we lose this one.

29
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,431
He's off the team after this.

30
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:56,837
The bugger blackmails on the crease!

31
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:05,590
Saw that?

32
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,021
Looks like we've lost it, Captain!

33
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:22,440
Shut up!

34
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,006
Saw that?

35
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:37,369
Go and get 10,000 from Babur.

36
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:39,790
The match closes with the next ball.

37
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:52,396
We've won, Captain!

38
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:53,962
No, it's that wretch who's won.

39
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,475
We're just getting 1,500 bucks.

40
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:13,258
God is the greatest

41
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,944
Farah!

42
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,681
Here she comes.

43
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,788
Peace be upon you
-God protect you from the evil eye. God be praised.

44
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:14,448
You don't know how long he's been gloomy

45
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:16,836
Look at him gladden at the very sight of you!

46
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,010
I'll -- be back.

47
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,749
Please don't leave without fixing the date.

48
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,041
Let your father come

49
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,451
I'll say it plainly:

50
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,841
I'll have dinner only when you fix the date.

51
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,321
And you better say something too.

52
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,851
Last time, you remained quiet, and dad said he'd think on it.

53
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,049
No, he's not a dosser

54
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,330
Having found no job after completing his BA

55
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,239
He spends some time with the lads.

56
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,300
One of them must be a loafer

57
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,059
Besmirching his reputation as well.

58
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,180
You know Molvi Sahab only too well

59
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,080
If he isn't back before dusk, he calls him a sinner.

60
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,399
Don't talk about Beenish

61
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,759
She'd said to me explicitly on the day of Eid,

62
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
'Aunt, I accept, but he does not'.

63
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,109
Uh -- no, Kulsoom --

64
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:15,789
Why won't he accept?

65
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,919
He must be teasing her for fun.

66
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,830
No, no, no -- Kulsoom, he's 25, not 28.

67
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,120
In fact, he's 25 just because Molvi Sahab wrote it a year older to get him admitted to school.

68
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:32,876
Here.

69
00:07:32,876 --> 00:07:36,716
24,000 in all.

70
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:40,103
That makes for a total of

71
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,476
98,000.

72
00:07:42,476 --> 00:07:44,486
Where do you get so much money from?

73
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,868
What do you mean?

74
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:47,856
I work hard; I earn it.

75
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,936
You're lying.

76
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:53,866
If you consider it a lie too, dad is going to rush to the police station with his rants about religious values!

77
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,636
He'll file a complaint against me.

78
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:57,297
You're into gambling, aren't you?

79
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:58,736
What?

80
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,246
Is it even possible?

81
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,816
Molvi Subhanallah's son is into gambling?

82
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,846
You're not a sister

83
00:08:07,846 --> 00:08:09,547
You're a sworn enemy.

84
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,097
What if dad gets to know?

85
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:12,446
It's a matter of two days

86
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:15,276
I'll deposit it in a bank once I open an account.

87
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,297
Alright, I'll keep it.

88
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,396
But please

89
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:21,086
Tell me one day about your job.

90
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,556
You're doubting me again?

91
00:08:22,556 --> 00:08:23,716
I'm not doubting you.

92
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,468
All I want is that if dad gives his judgement on this matter, I can say firmly,

93
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:29,176
'This is my brother's hard-earned money'.

94
00:08:29,346 --> 00:08:30,986
Don't talk about him.

95
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:34,116
He even thinks it's unlawful to deposit money at a bank.

96
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:35,466
Keep it inside, quick.

97
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:38,926
If mum gets to know, she'll start on it.

98
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,103
This is your room.

99
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:11,108
Have a look and let me know if you need anything.

100
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,720
Last time, I had stayed in the room upstairs...

101
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,988
This is the best room in the house.

102
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:25,918
As the date is fixed, you rise in status.

103
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:28,851
But...

104
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,268
But what?

105
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:32,578
You don't like it?

106
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:35,608
The room's alright, but...

107
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,670
I would often catch a glimpse of her from the room upstairs.

108
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,132
Shall I arrange a meeting?

109
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,302
Is it possible?

110
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:45,712
She's said it herself this time

111
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:49,022
Before dad comes back, you are invited to meet her on the terrace.

112
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:50,882
When does he come back?

113
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,802
Ask when you're invited to meet her.
-When?

114
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,274
9 o'clock sharp.

115
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:58,272
Dad comes back at 10.

116
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,884
You've got 40 minutes.

117
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:04,154
Mind if I share a few precautional musings about the meeting?

118
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:05,485
Please.

119
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,994
Talk from afar.

120
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:12,014
And don't tell her how many cars and châteaux you have

121
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:14,657
Just tell her how much you love her.

122
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,074
That I will.

123
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:19,574
If she asks something, give a thoughtful answer.

124
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:20,514
Sure.

125
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:25,054
And even if she comes close, don't place your hand on her shoulder or hand!

126
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:29,524
I won't, but please tell me - this espousal has her acceptance, doesn't it?

127
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:33,106
Did you see her cheeks redden at the sight of you?

128
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,769
Redden --?
-I did!

129
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,800
This means she's very happy.

130
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:46,149
But the last time when I tried to talk to her

131
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,579
She had a go at me -- so to speak.

132
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,229
You were a stranger then

133
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,869
She only knew you were the son of a friend of her father's.

134
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:56,100
Father has many friends, and they have many sons.

135
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,380
She doesn't talk to all of them.

136
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,201
Now I got it.

137
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:05,221
When the date is decided upon

138
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,354
Place your hand on hers

139
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,621
Then she won't push you away.

140
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:30,894
Did you say it?

141
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,724
I did.

142
00:11:33,724 --> 00:11:35,473
What did he say?

143
00:11:35,473 --> 00:11:38,894
He said he'd not place his hand on your shoulder or hand.

144
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:41,234
What?

145
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:42,803
Did he intend to?

146
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:43,983
No.

147
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:46,004
I just forbade him as a precaution.

148
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,693
Mum says that nothing is written when it comes to the intentions of men.

149
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:52,473
Who knows - he might have reached for your hand the moment you started talking.

150
00:11:52,538 --> 00:11:55,753
That's why I forbade him from committing this mistake.

151
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,344
That's fine.

152
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,166
I've told him to meet you at 9 o'clock.

153
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,684
I'd said 9.30.

154
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:03,193
Dad said he'd be back at 10.

155
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:05,963
If, perchance, he arrived at 9.30?

156
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:07,733
Fine.

157
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,503
Alright then.

158
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,632
Why do you want to meet him though?

159
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,092
Is there any good reason?

160
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:23,512
It may just help me someday.

161
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,702
I'll tell you everything once I come down from the terrace.

162
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:30,092
And I pray that all of them will be of use to you someday!

163
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,000
Alright. I'll be with mum and aunt, and you go up as soon as the clock strikes 9.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,330
Okay?

165
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,020
Ahh... Let my past remain ensepulchred beneath dust.

166
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,052
For my past is but obloquy to me.

167
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,950
Great!
-Great!

168
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,010
Reified by yearning, meed for my endeavours

169
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,639
Is nothing but inglorious woe?

170
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,359
Don't chronicle my love before me

171
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:12,899
Instead, let me speak out the fortitude of my love.

172
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,930
Excellent!
-Well said!

173
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,859
And that ebrious gaze that abandoned me

174
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,750
I was never one to admire it;

175
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,609
The very tresses, gaze, cheeks, and form

176
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,720
I can find if so I desire -

177
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,919
Excellent!
-Great!

178
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:36,267
The lilies destined to blossom for them

179
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:38,952
Can blossom too where their gaze can't reach them.

180
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,728
Oh great!
-That's great!

181
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,634
Very well said!
-That's the real deal!

182
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,213
You sound like a man today!

183
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:50,293
Forget the harpy and marry someone better!

184
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,483
And rent a house in front of hers.

185
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,623
Show her you're a man!

186
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:58,073
Then watch her file for divorce within months!

187
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,133
It seems you've called her again.

188
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:01,168
Got scolded again?

189
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,788
No mate...

190
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,919
Disconnected at the sound of my voice,

191
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:07,738
Then answered when I tried again,

192
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,488
And said, 'Who is it'?

193
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:11,058
I said, 'I'm Sajid'.

194
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:13,739
And she said, 'Sajid who'?

195
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,169
Do you understand what it means?

196
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:19,147
It means skive off, chap.

197
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:22,467
'Leave me alone'!

198
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,907
That's what it means.

199
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,007
One of these days I'll curse you.

200
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:31,277
I'll say, 'May you be accursed with such adoration'!

201
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:37,875
It scares me the way you keep on laughing to yourself.

202
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:40,919
Why?

203
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,439
Just --

204
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,549
She writes to you twice a week, right?

205
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,050
What if she forgets to for one week?

206
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,269
As if that's possible!

207
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,330
She's not like your dear Chanda;

208
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,660
She'd die without me.

209
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:55,550
Do you know what she's written this time?

210
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,991
You received her letter?

211
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,360
You must have - today's Saturday, after all!

212
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,239
Read it out to us.

213
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:03,448
Hearing her words,

214
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:05,631
It feels as if one Chanda might've killed all affection

215
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:07,330
A second Chanda might as well resurrect it.

216
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,911
Her name's not Chanda.

217
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:11,383
So tell us her name today.

218
00:15:11,383 --> 00:15:13,310
I have great respect for her.

219
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,722
I'll mention her honourably.

220
00:15:14,722 --> 00:15:16,910
I will, someday.

221
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:18,994
Listen to her words first.

222
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:22,900
Man was born for his compassion towards the suffering

223
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,050
For there was no shortage of beings for subservience alone.

224
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,459
There was no shortage of divine spirits and angels to serve God.

225
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,350
Why was man born?

226
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,385
Man was born for the sake of the pains he goes through and his deeds of compassion.

227
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:39,410
That is why the rights of servants --

228
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh --

229
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,420
God, I beg You to grant me the best of Your favours.

230
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,933
May you have a long life, son.

231
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:58,606
Dear Afzal,

232
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,826
She always addresses you as 'Dear Afzal'!

233
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:03,986
Shut up! Go on, mate.

234
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:07,616
How are you?

235
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,316
Everything good?

236
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,149
I see the best in you whenever I see you.

237
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,732
Always fresh!

238
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,442
Where do you meet?

239
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,286
That I will not tell.

240
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:22,412
Just keep on reading. Don't stop to answer his questions.

241
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:25,222
You stay with me for but a few minutes,

242
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,978
Eager every second of it to leave.

243
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:32,339
When will that time come when you will be before my eyes all night,

244
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:36,506
And I, like a devotee, shall relish every moment of my deity's presence?

245
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:40,286
When will it be, Afzal? And how?

246
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:43,462
Seeing you vivifies me

247
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,809
And when you vanish from my sight, it is as if the grim reaper has struck me.

248
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,079
I'd die without you.

249
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:53,829
That's it?

250
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,189
That's it.

251
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,709
For my sake, at least tell me her name.

252
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,950
Nope. That I won't tell.

253
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:04,509
You and your 'I won't tell'.

254
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,223
Mehtab?

255
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,121
Yes?

256
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,343
Let's sit down, shall we?

257
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:55,643
Where should I sit?

258
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,059
Why, right here, with me.

259
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:16,360
If you want to ask something

260
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,689
Or say something, please do.

261
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,173
All I want to say --

262
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,313
You're very beautiful.

263
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:29,813
That's it?

264
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,747
Uh -- No...

265
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,489
When you softly called out, 'Mehtab',

266
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,639
I swear I nearly died at that moment.

267
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,179
Your voice is fatal.

268
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,233
Fatal?

269
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,329
Uh -- I mean -- in a sweet manner...

270
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,679
It touches my heart.

271
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,803
Where in Karachi do you live?

272
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,859
Clifton, Block 2.

273
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:57,589
Wow...

274
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,052
Your house must be quite the chateau.

275
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:01,090
Ye -- No.

276
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,200
It's a small one.

277
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,179
How many cars do you own?

278
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,787
Just -- just the one parked here.

279
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,337
As in... You're going through hard times?

280
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,677
No -- It's nothing like that.

281
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,807
Nothing like 'hard times' in my life.

282
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,198
Then why aren't you telling me?

283
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,227
You have five cars.

284
00:19:25,427 --> 00:19:26,570
You own four houses -

285
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,087
Two in Karachi, and two in Larkana.

286
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:38,548
The thing is -- Lubna had warned against talking about houses and cars with you.

287
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,783
You'd be angry.

288
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,483
Monseigneur's here.

289
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,410
Peace be upon you, Dad.

290
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,516
And upon you, peace.

291
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:12,496
Aunt Shugufta and Mehtab are here.

292
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,728
Oh?

293
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:16,156
Aunt said she'd leave only after the date is decided.

294
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,295
Alright, I will decide on it.

295
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:20,778
But tell me - is it acceptable to her?

296
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,425
I think so...

297
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:00,756
I want to study further.

298
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,740
Why not?

299
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:06,630
Even after I'm married.

300
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm pursuing a Masters in Economics.

301
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,699
And will pursue my MPhil. in London.

302
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,676
Why?

303
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,406
What do you mean?

304
00:21:16,953 --> 00:21:18,793
What's wrong?

305
00:21:18,793 --> 00:21:21,043
And most importantly:

306
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:25,183
I want to get a job that's as glorious as it is grandiose!

307
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:28,039
My wife will work?

308
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,759
No way.

309
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,069
Everyone will insult me.

310
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:33,629
Who?

311
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,699
Friends -- relatives -- all of them...

312
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,180
And in all honesty, you'd hardly have the time.

313
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,240
You'll have to take care of me.

314
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,129
I'm so childlike.

315
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,052
I'll need you all the time.

316
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,959
So -- you won't work?

317
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,211
I don't need to work.

318
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,089
I have some 200 - 220 million in my account already.

319
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,030
I don't even know how much I spend per year,

320
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,615
But the balance just refuses to come down.

321
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:01,416
You know why?

322
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,274
Why?

323
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:05,590
Just the earnings from land revenues amount to 20 million.

324
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:13,450
What will we do after marriage, then?

325
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,650
Have a jolly good time, what else?

326
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:26,916
What happened?

327
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:29,434
Was it something I said?

328
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,759
You know, when I was young --

329
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:40,229
Leave my hand!

330
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:41,950
I despise people like you

331
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,459
Who are in this world just to 'have a jolly good time'.

332
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:04,356
Everything was fine until now.

333
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,447
Then she started talking about her education.

334
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:09,666
She said she'd be going to London to pursue her MPhil after marriage.

335
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,318
Stupid, isn't it?

336
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:14,378
London is best for honeymoon, isn't it?

337
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,179
Lu -- Lubna!

338
00:24:12,579 --> 00:24:13,860
What time is it?

339
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,676
It's 10.

340
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,659
Call Safiya

341
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:25,990
And tell her the match is not fit.

342
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:30,162
What do you mean?

343
00:24:31,523 --> 00:24:36,223
It means that Molvi Subhanallah won't allow

344
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:40,313
The wife to be cared for on money earned through gambling.

345
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:42,063
Gambling?

346
00:24:43,443 --> 00:24:48,314
He's won 24,500 today,

347
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:56,810
And 16,000 of them the wretch had won in the match that Pakistan had lost.

348
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,990
Oh God!

349
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,791
I've heard he even smokes weed when he gets the chance.

350
00:25:02,857 --> 00:25:07,007
And... Some girl writes letters to him.

351
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:09,377
I don't know who she is

352
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:12,110
But, sitting with his friends,

353
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,687
He reads her lettes out to them.

354
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:20,467
You're starting to question yourself, aren't you?

355
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:24,657
The same can be said of me.

356
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:29,767
When I teach little kids these days,

357
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,737
It feels as if

358
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:34,427
They're staring at me,

359
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:37,437
And asking, 'Whose father are you'?

360
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:40,170
'And look at what you talk about'.

361
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:44,747
Even the prayers lack that spirit

362
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,562
Every moment, a fear stings at me as I step out of the Mosque...

363
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:52,939
That the police

364
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,176
May be at the doorstep holding that scoundrel by the collar.

365
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:03,255
Tell him to leave this place!

366
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:10,317
For the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

367
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,569
Is it only an accusation

368
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,840
Or do you have proof of it as well?

369
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,830
I'm not accepting it without evidence.

370
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,130
I have brought reliable information.

371
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,410
One of these days, you were struck with calamity at 'information'.

372
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,300
You'd even told me not to repeat it unless proven true.

373
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,429
Present evidence if you have,

374
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,759
Else in this matter of crime and punishment, your word cannot be taken for the truth.

375
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,529
And if you have evidence,

376
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,280
I swear by you

377
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:46,274
I would hit him with my shoes a hundred times.

378
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,760
I'll order him firmly to leave this place,

379
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,960
For the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

380
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:23,629
I don't accept!

381
00:27:23,629 --> 00:27:26,960
Tell dad I'm not marrying Mehtab Chawla.

382
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:28,968
You should've said this earlier.

383
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,400
Now they've gathered to decide the date.

384
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,589
It's not the end of the world!

385
00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:36,370
Go and whisper into his ears; tell him --

386
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,601
-- That I don't accept.

387
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:39,379
He'll get up instantly.

388
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:41,927
You're strange.

389
00:27:41,978 --> 00:27:44,456
You were one to enjoy the feast,

390
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,926
What has happened to you the moment you've swallowed what you bit?

391
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:50,038
I can't swallow this one, that's it!

392
00:27:51,858 --> 00:27:53,830
Can't do anything now.

393
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,190
For my sake

394
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:00,270
Tell mum. I'll handle the rest.

395
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,440
Alright, I'll tell her.

396
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,050
Yes, please do.

397
00:28:15,506 --> 00:28:18,286
What if he died when he heard it?

398
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,789
There's a possibility he might...

399
00:28:22,189 --> 00:28:24,049
Go!

400
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,873
Don't lie to me.

401
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:34,827
You won 8000 in the local match, and 16000 when Pakistan lost.

402
00:28:34,827 --> 00:28:35,673
What?

403
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,282
I swea--

404
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:41,457
Yes, I swear.

405
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:43,104
You're lying again.

406
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:45,033
Dad knows everything.

407
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:49,793
Mentioned all of it and said that the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

408
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,490
Does Mum believe it?

409
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,350
Don't talk about her; I believe it.

410
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:59,750
And I know these 98000 you kept with me - all of it you made through gambling.

411
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,060
And who's this girl who writes letters to you?

412
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,531
Girl?

413
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,766
Did you say it?

414
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,106
Yes.

415
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,846
Tell me how it went. Whom did you speak to?

416
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:23,940
Mum.

417
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,106
Great! Then?

418
00:29:26,106 --> 00:29:27,097
I know.

419
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,936
Mum would've said it flatly -

420
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,936
'Leave it, Ibrahim, she doesn't accept it'.

421
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,126
Isn't it?

422
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,326
It isn't.

423
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:36,379
Mum stuffed this sweet into my mouth the moment she heard it.

424
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,346
Gave me this plate of sweets, and said, 'These are for her'.

425
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:42,796
The 15th of December is the big day.

426
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,489
Who is it?

427
00:29:57,489 --> 00:29:58,910
It's me, Afzal.

428
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,591
Had your dinner?

429
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,769
Yes.

430
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:08,200
Go and sleep then.

431
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,239
Peace be upon you.

432
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:53,609
And upon you, peace.

433
00:30:54,189 --> 00:30:55,779
May you live long.

434
00:30:57,196 --> 00:30:58,949
Is someone coming, or will you go on your own?

435
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:02,978
Who's coming? I'll go myself.

436
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,119
Did he come?

437
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:10,959
Yes.

438
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,479
I figured as much.

439
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,186
I'll go and rouse him.

440
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:21,096
He can drop you.

441
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:22,916
Leave it be.

442
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:26,447
Shame on he who calls himself a believer,

443
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:32,337
Who drops another at the Mosque and leaves.

444
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:36,537
When he wakes up, tell him

445
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:40,717
I'd like to meet him before noon.

446
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:49,326
And remember, if you're listening

447
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:54,201
Today's meeting will be more important than your conventicles!

448
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:08,676
I love somebody else.

449
00:32:09,697 --> 00:32:10,826
What?

450
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:11,976
Did you hear that?

451
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:14,746
Lightning will strike him when he'd hear this.

452
00:32:14,996 --> 00:32:16,477
I've come to know

453
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,750
He'll be staying here to celebrate.

454
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:21,447
And if he'll stay,

455
00:32:21,498 --> 00:32:24,136
I'll meet him again tonight.

456
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:26,539
And what do you intend to do?

457
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,659
What else would I do?

458
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:30,799
With two teardrops, I'll say,

459
00:32:31,556 --> 00:32:33,606
'I'm sorry, Mehtab',

460
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:35,906
'But it's important'

461
00:32:35,906 --> 00:32:37,787
'That you know the truth before our marriage'.

462
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,357
'Before our marriage'?

463
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,233
'If someone else told you later on, it'd hurt you far more'.

464
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:45,137
Honestly, what is it?

465
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:49,708
'I love somebody else'.

466
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:52,206
'Truly'.

467
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,876
'I've loved him since our schooldays'.

468
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:58,646
'We used to write letters to each other',

469
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:01,426
'But now, we talk over the phone for hours'.

470
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,610
'We'd sworn oaths',

471
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,829
'Made promises',

472
00:33:04,888 --> 00:33:07,500
'To live and die together'.

473
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,925
'But what good is it now'?

474
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:11,735
'Now I'm getting married off to you'.

475
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:13,645
'I have to be yours'.

476
00:33:13,645 --> 00:33:15,615
A fib.
-Might as well be!

477
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:17,462
But he will take it for the truth.

478
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:18,592
This time, he'd die for real

479
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,372
The moment he'd hear this.

480
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:22,142
He won't die.

481
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:24,902
He'd much rather kill his dreams

482
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,262
And say as he leaves,

483
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,292
'I'm not marrying this girl'.

484
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,262
Great.

485
00:33:29,262 --> 00:33:30,562
As if it's that easy.

486
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,339
Is Dad going to stay quiet?

487
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:35,029
He'll hurl abuses at them?
-No.

488
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,373
He'll ask his Mum why he's rejected.

489
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:41,390
Then his Mum will ask him, 'What happened so suddenly'?

490
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,559
'You've changed after a second meeting'.

491
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,199
Don't worry.

492
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,206
He'll change.

493
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,940
Halt!

494
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,541
What are you doing?

495
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:07,427
Oh! It's you, Molvi Sahab.

496
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:08,707
Peace be upon you.

497
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,450
And upon you, peace.

498
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,137
This man 'ere's a thief.

499
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,917
Stole a mobile and was trying to get away.

500
00:34:14,147 --> 00:34:16,507
Round him up and get him in the car.

501
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,004
You're going to the Mosque?

502
00:34:19,004 --> 00:34:20,274
Yes.

503
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:21,724
Shall I drop you?

504
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:22,877
No --

505
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:25,677
I'll go on my own. Please, do your duty.

506
00:34:25,677 --> 00:34:27,158
With peace.

507
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:42,193
Have some tea.

508
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,990
Or you'll catch a cold.

509
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,170
Thanks.

510
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:49,587
Dad's left?

511
00:34:50,517 --> 00:34:51,807
He's left.

512
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,061
Why are you following me?

513
00:34:58,418 --> 00:34:59,788
Just a second.

514
00:35:12,565 --> 00:35:14,854
You're into gambling, aren't you?

515
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,310
And hand over all the money you win to me.

516
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:25,336
[Call to prayer]

517
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:28,966
These pennies will, one day, become serpents and scorpions.

518
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,547
They sting Dad today; they might as well sting you tomorrow.

519
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,086
Leave it be.

520
00:35:34,086 --> 00:35:36,337
It's my hard-earned money.

521
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:38,648
You smoke weed.

522
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,500
A lie!

523
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,720
God forgive!

524
00:35:52,909 --> 00:35:56,332
Alright, give me the keys to your cupboard.

525
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:58,149
What's in the cupboard?

526
00:35:58,149 --> 00:35:59,679
Her letters

527
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,522
That you read out to your friends.

528
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,449
Gambling, weed, her letters...

529
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:08,880
Dad knows about it all.

530
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,885
You should be ashamed of yourself, Afzal.

531
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:15,540
If she writes letters to you, you read them out to your friends?

532
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,503
Like a pallbearer of her honour.

533
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,636
Take this tea back,

534
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,086
And leave.

535
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:32,057
Don't accuse me like Dad does.

536
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:41,241
Say it now that it's all false. [Swear to me]

537
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,720
Who's she?

538
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:05,927
I won't tell you her name.

539
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,837
I've sworn to her.

540
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:10,897
And what about Beenish?

541
00:37:11,347 --> 00:37:12,802
Beenish?

542
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,607
Aunt Sofya's daughter?

543
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,028
What's her problem now?

544
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:22,807
Mum's decided to get you married to her.

545
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:25,308
Ohh God --

546
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,578
What 'Ohh'? She's coming here in a few days.

547
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,534
Beenish is coming too?

548
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:32,025
Perhaps.

549
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:35,900
Let them come.

550
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,819
Let her come too?

551
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,196
I'll give her a befitting reply

552
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,616
She won't even turn to look at me again.

553
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:46,431
As if she was going to, anyhow.

554
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,366
You don't even need to give her a 'befitting reply'.

555
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:52,146
Shatter her dreams quietly.

556
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,117
Don't slam it into the ground, roaring,

557
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,700
'I've shattered them'!

558
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:59,036
Why not just say not to her?

559
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:00,897
Tell her

560
00:38:02,306 --> 00:38:06,103
That she's only got wanton rampage waiting for her.

561
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:08,074
Anyway, who's she?

562
00:38:10,104 --> 00:38:12,913
Don't tell me her name, just where she's from.

563
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,269
Not far away.

564
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,587
In fact, this city itself.

565
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,217
She must be beautiful.

566
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:27,969
Very.

567
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,280
Fairy-like.

568
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:35,869
She's happy with you?

569
00:38:37,058 --> 00:38:38,539
Why not?

570
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,559
She must know that you

571
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,359
Smoke weed, gamble,

572
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,290
And read out her letters to friends?

573
00:38:49,141 --> 00:38:50,413
See?

574
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:54,021
You're my sister for just a few moments,

575
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:56,861
Until Dad starts speaking from your mouth.

576
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,032
You should remember, too, Afzal,

577
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:02,442
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son.

578
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:04,612
Go to sleep early.

579
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,560
Dad wants to meet you before noon.

580
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,810
