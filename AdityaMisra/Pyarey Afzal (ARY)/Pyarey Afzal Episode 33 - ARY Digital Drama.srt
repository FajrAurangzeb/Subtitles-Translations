1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,979
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:18,039
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:23,399
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,680
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,339
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:40,159
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:47,574
He's here, Yasmin.

8
00:02:51,394 --> 00:02:52,895
He looks so handsome!

9
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,364
I swear!

10
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:48,684
You won't wish me peace today?

11
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,464
I won't today.

12
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,544
How do I look?

13
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,003
The sweetest;

14
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,345
The best. ['Afzal']

15
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,380
Come.

16
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,788
It's time for the engagement.

17
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:53,144
Come on, my daughter, it's getting late.

18
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,071
Greetings.

19
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,271
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur Ibrahim!
-And upon you, peace.

20
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,147
Congratulations!

21
00:04:59,277 --> 00:05:00,898
To you as well.

22
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,585
Come.

23
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:06,167
I've

24
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:09,655
Brought the old ring.

25
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,415
Farah had said

26
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:17,305
That she'd only wear this one today.

27
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:21,790
Alright, Molvi Sahab. Come.

28
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,844
Here, Yasmin. Place the ring on him.

29
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,271
Congratulations!

30
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:06,031
Afzal, place the ring on her now.

31
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,998
Sir!

32
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,265
Here.

33
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,389
Your turn now, Monsieur.

34
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,999
No, Monseigneur.

35
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,979
It is my request

36
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:32,667
That Molvi Subhanallah should be the one

37
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:36,315
To place the ring on my daughter on my behalf.

38
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,587
Me --?

39
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,186
No -- I -- I'm nobody.

40
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,800
Come on, Molvi Sahab.

41
00:07:56,429 --> 00:08:00,089
When you call her your daughter, it makes you her father.

42
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:01,210
Come.

43
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:14,059
<i>Every compeer</i>

44
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:18,982
<i>Every compeer</i>

45
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:25,309
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

46
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:30,649
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

47
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:36,309
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

48
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,619
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

49
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:46,982
<i>I found even my own shadow</i>

50
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:53,039
<i>Apathetic and blasé</i>

51
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:59,000
<i>Who were those people</i>

52
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,160
<i>Who won their love?</i>

53
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,431
Molvi Sahab!

54
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:04,126
He's had a heart attack.

55
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:08,134
A very severe one.

56
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,961
Come here.

57
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,741
Sit by me.

58
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,892
Don't worry.

59
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,329
A son's attack strikes worse than a heart attack.

60
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:38,589
Nothing happened then, and I'm sure nothing will happen to him now.

61
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,156
Hey! Stop crying.

62
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:47,877
Else I'd think Molvi Sahab's words and deeds are contradictory.

63
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,568
It's just a heart attack, isn't it?

64
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,737
Everything else is alright...?

65
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,277
Yes, everything else is alright.

66
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:58,772
Alright.

67
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,037
You heard that?

68
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,658
I know Molvi Sahab well enough.

69
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,949
It's been 28 years

70
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,502
He's never been into knavery with me.

71
00:12:15,898 --> 00:12:17,117
Don't think

72
00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:19,777
He tripped because of the heart attack.

73
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,277
No, no, it was something else...

74
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:25,904
You raised your hand to wear the ring

75
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:29,374
He must've thought you're pointing your finger at him.

76
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,764
He must've remembered his coconut biscuits...

77
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,905
The poor lass gets all worried up.

78
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:40,245
She lacks that belief

79
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:44,216
Despite the fact that Molvi Sahab had said to her,

80
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,422
'Arifa',

81
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,897
'If you pray and yet worry',

82
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,947
'It means you don't have faith in He who shall accept it'.

83
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,235
'Accursed be such a prayer'.

84
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:01,294
Come here.

85
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:03,226
Please, sit.

86
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,231
As he was getting ready for the engagement,

87
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,232
I thought for a while I'd stop him.

88
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:27,602
That I say, 'Molvi Sahab, it's not propitious for you to attend engagements'.

89
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,716
But then

90
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:32,746
Thinking of his friendship with Farah, I stayed quiet.

91
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:36,127
Thought he'd feel about it if he did not go.

92
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:38,188
Once he gets well,

93
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:40,639
Please don't invite him to the next engagement.

94
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,916
What are you saying?

95
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,842
Only what's right.

96
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:49,451
The thing is, it hurt a little to know about Afzal's engagement.

97
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,592
That he did not invite us.

98
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:53,606
But I was relieved,

99
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,347
Because if he'd gone there,

100
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:58,196
That engagement would never have happened.

101
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:03,874
Why don't you ask?

102
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:05,975
He must've come to now.

103
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:10,621
How's he, Doctor?

104
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:13,330
Blessed you; he's regained consciousness.

105
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,739
Thank God!

106
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:15,940
There!

107
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,606
He's come to.

108
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,826
I'd known it.

109
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:21,326
He'd come to right away.

110
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,446
He'll ask the moment he gets up

111
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:25,596
If she's been engaged.

112
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:29,457
He'll be happy that the engagement's been postponed.

113
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,137
I saw you here for the first time.

114
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:48,864
My heart...

115
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:51,094
Felt something when I saw you.

116
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:55,264
I hope you understand what 'something' means to a girl?

117
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:01,775
She feels it'll kill her to control her heart.

118
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:06,608
You did the right thing in getting engaged to me.

119
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,375
I was lost, Afzal.

120
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:16,426
As you turn away your gaze, it seems you're rueful about yourself.

121
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,436
I know why.

122
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,297
You didn't invite your parents.

123
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:29,103
That explains it, doesn't it?

124
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:33,921
Yes.
-Then why didn't you invite them?

125
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,844
They'd never have come.

126
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:41,898
Especially Dad.

127
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,468
Mum and Arifa would have, then.

128
00:15:47,018 --> 00:15:49,068
You don't know Mum.

129
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:51,923
When she talks,

130
00:15:51,923 --> 00:15:53,782
She's Afzal's mother.

131
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,372
When she pronounces a judgement,

132
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,130
She's Molvi Subhanallah's wife.

133
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,579
They must've come to know.

134
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,011
No.

135
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:04,689
They don't know.

136
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:06,816
They do.

137
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,948
They called me.

138
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:13,278
She was on the rack because of you.

139
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:17,124
This is an old habit of yours, Afzal.

140
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:19,180
You torment the one

141
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,945
Who feels a torment for you.

142
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,482
Who gave them your number?

143
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:25,961
I don't know.

144
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,413
They must've found out somehow.

145
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,153
Those who know where to look do eventually find out.

146
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:35,834
I'm wicked, Yasmin...

147
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,754
That's the second time I've struck them.

148
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,395
Mum must've teared up and Dad must've put his hand over his heart.

149
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:47,236
But he won't weep before anyone.

150
00:16:47,196 --> 00:16:48,725
Give me your address.

151
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:52,496
I'd promised them to come right after the engagement.

152
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:55,318
If you don't, I'll call and ask them.

153
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,734
And this - I've just asked permission to go.

154
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,044
Should I?

155
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,494
No.

156
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:04,603
Not now.

157
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,934
Keep up with these orders after the marriage.

158
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,443
For now, behave like a fiancé.

159
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:18,172
Yes, Timmy?

160
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:21,442
A -- Alladio called from Hyderabad.

161
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:23,954
Bad news, Afzal.

162
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,763
Go on.

163
00:17:28,976 --> 00:17:30,492
It's --

164
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:35,838
Molvi Sahab's had a heart attack.

165
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,763
The doctors have sent me outside.

166
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:58,622
'Not now', they said.

167
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:02,262
Just see him for now, and leave.

168
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,345
I've seen him.

169
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,021
He, too, got a bit embarrassed when he saw me.

170
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,456
Turned his gaze away momentarily.

171
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,866
Why was he embarrassed?

172
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,586
He used to think I'd be the one to have a heart attack.

173
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,491
I used to place my hand over my heart in agony,

174
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:25,881
And he'd call the doctor that instant.

175
00:18:27,672 --> 00:18:28,993
And now...

176
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:33,012
His heart couldn't take it...

177
00:18:35,502 --> 00:18:38,539
He doesn't let it come on his face.

178
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,353
Why should it, really...

179
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:43,629
He doesn't let what's in his heart come on his face.
-Mum...

180
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:45,395
Right here.

181
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:49,138
His sweet little one's feeling bad about me remembering all of this.

182
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,864
But I will say everything.

183
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,852
Your Dad's been hollow-hearted.

184
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,154
How?

185
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:01,708
Once, he said to me,

186
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:04,866
'We've given our hearts to each other'.

187
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:07,587
'So, what does that mean'?

188
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:11,473
I asked what it meant,

189
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,015
And he said,

190
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:15,476
'If an affliction strikes my heart',

191
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:19,838
'I'll take it to mean that you didn't keep it safe from harm'.

192
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,956
And this --

193
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,447
This heart attack he's had

194
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,599
It's not that he's had this attack

195
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,342
My heart's the one afflicted.

196
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,300
You will see

197
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,759
Once he gets back home,

198
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,729
It'll be said plainly.

199
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:43,820
I'll say, 'Take your heart, and give me mine back'.

200
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,549
Who are you?

201
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:28,702
Hello?

202
00:21:28,702 --> 00:21:29,843
Right...

203
00:21:30,386 --> 00:21:32,803
Here. Talk to him.

204
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:37,224
Hello?

205
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,344
Who's it?

206
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,829
Inspector Shamsi Rehman.

207
00:21:43,628 --> 00:21:44,708
Let them go.

208
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,098
Who are you, sir?

209
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:49,712
Disconnect; I'll call your number.

210
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,741
You may proceed.
-Alright.

211
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:09,751
Yes sir?

212
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:13,136
Of course I'd recognised your voice, sir.

213
00:22:14,763 --> 00:22:16,773
You'd said it, sir.

214
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:19,396
Check all who pass.

215
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:23,653
Alright sir. Okay.

216
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,126
There you are! Good.

217
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:43,836
It's getting late, please have something.

218
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:45,026
No, thank you.

219
00:22:45,506 --> 00:22:49,476
I've made a promise to have breakfast with him.

220
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:52,336
So have I made a promise -

221
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:56,486
I'd give something to eat to the others only after you've had something.

222
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,936
It's up to you.

223
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,047
They'll all be hungry because of you.

224
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,427
No -- I'll have something.

225
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:31,888
Dad called.

226
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:33,836
He gave a suggestion.

227
00:23:34,477 --> 00:23:35,975
What?

228
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:37,177
He said

229
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:39,738
Molvi Sahab will be fine by daybreak.

230
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:42,861
So?

231
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,103
So --

232
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:45,674
Why not go forth with the engagement here?

233
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:50,054
I mean -- I've been carrying the ring with me, so --

234
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:02,534
I'd told Dad you'd not agree to it.

235
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,713
Enjoy the meal.

236
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,931
A --

237
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,056
Afzal?

238
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:35,918
Afzal?

239
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,122
Come here, my dear...

240
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:44,349
I've been missing you...

241
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,853
Come here, my child...

242
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:52,083
Afzal...

243
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:59,309
Child...

244
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:02,945
My son... Come here.

245
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,536
Come here, my dearest...

246
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:28,126
Is there a Mr Afzal here?

247
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:30,427
He's calling Afzal?

248
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,928
He's calling him.

249
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:44,096
Go.

250
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,831
He's called you.

251
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:48,738
Not her; he's called Afzal.

252
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,371
She's Afzal.

253
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:52,798
She's Afzal in his absence.

254
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:50,166
She's my daughter.

255
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,774
Enough...

256
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:58,129
My hand is drenched with your tears...

257
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,864
What happened?

258
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:03,483
Nothing.

259
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:05,457
Just --

260
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,926
You scared us all.

261
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,530
Scared her too?

262
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:12,284
No.

263
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:14,088
Not her.

264
00:27:14,856 --> 00:27:16,650
Kept saying,

265
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,350
'Molvi Sahab's not hollow-hearted'.

266
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:22,961
She has her own way to reason...

267
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:25,805
Says anything...

268
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:30,232
And God smiles on hearing it...

269
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,240
Who's the one he was calling out to in his sleep?

270
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:36,876
In my sleep?

271
00:27:36,876 --> 00:27:38,924
Who was I calling out to?

272
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,535
Afzal. You mentioned a certain Afzal.

273
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,598
Asleep or unconscious?

274
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,721
I cannot make such a mistake in my sleep...

275
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:52,159
But then there's no power but God's...

276
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:58,323
Where's --?

277
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,036
He's not come, Dad.

278
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,742
He doesn't even know.

279
00:28:02,037 --> 00:28:05,117
I'm not talking about him --

280
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,929
I was asking about your mother.

281
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,600
Please, let her come too...

282
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:19,904
And don't tell her I called out to 'Afzal' in my sleep...

283
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:23,804
Her heart's a bit frail...

284
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,617
Sure, but only for a short while.

285
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,368
Afzal is my son.

286
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,607
Rather unduteous...

287
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:42,042
Which is why I'm cross with him...

288
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:05,913
Yes sir

289
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,960
He's entered Hyderabad.

290
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,830
No sir,

291
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,364
Three cars.

292
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,332
The third one has his guards.

293
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:16,609
Don't worry, sir!

294
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:19,729
Look, Molvi Sahab

295
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:22,345
Who's here.

296
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:28,984
Miss Coconut Biscuits is at your feet.

297
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:35,397
Gotten engaged?

298
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,058
Did you hear that?

299
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:40,496
The first question. Satisfy him.

300
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,088
Tell him she's not gotten engaged.

301
00:29:43,452 --> 00:29:45,614
The engagement can wait.

302
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,648
Get well soon and come home. Then, we'll fix the date.

303
00:29:53,754 --> 00:29:54,907
There now.

304
00:29:54,907 --> 00:29:56,674
Look at his happiness.

305
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:02,466
He's saying he's not happy.

306
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:06,029
Would've been better if she'd gotten engaged.

307
00:30:13,674 --> 00:30:14,832
Look -

308
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:17,066
The groom's here too.

309
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:22,596
He's been here all the time.

310
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,549
Ready as if

311
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:27,829
He'd go forth with the wedding on this very day.

312
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,820
What do you know, son,

313
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:34,188
He's one who'd not let his son get engaged.

314
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,107
Who are you?

315
00:30:37,594 --> 00:30:39,738
He's the one who'll put the ring on me.

316
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,390
I'm adamant over this.

317
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:44,621
You're clashing with God's man.

318
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:45,918
You'll pay for it later.

319
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:49,326
What are you saying, Ruqaiyya?

320
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,740
Look at the gloom on her face...

321
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:00,949
We know whom we're clashing with.

322
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:04,832
We'll pay for it if we have to, but make no complaints.

323
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,510
Excuse me for a while; I'll leave them home.

324
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,754
No -- no,

325
00:31:15,754 --> 00:31:17,925
There's no need to come...

326
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:19,444
I'm fine now...

327
00:31:19,673 --> 00:31:22,458
I'll come for my rightful reward.

328
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:26,111
At this age, one has to struggle to win it.

329
00:31:27,356 --> 00:31:29,786
Come, my child.

330
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,518
I'll bring you breakfast tomorrow.

331
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,318
Good be with ye.

332
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,775
I'm leaving Sibtain here.

333
00:31:42,493 --> 00:31:46,726
Why are you troubling me, my good man?

334
00:31:48,627 --> 00:31:50,721
Sorry, son...

335
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:53,581
You're trapped here for nothing.

336
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,828
Not at all, Molvi Uncle,

337
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,047
No one's trapped me.

338
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:58,537
I told Dad I'd stay here.

339
00:32:01,913 --> 00:32:04,116
Alright, goodbye.

340
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:05,748
Goodbye.

341
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,555
Did you see, Ruqaiyya?

342
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:17,917
The world owes a lot to people like them.

343
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,072
Else the horn [of Doomsday] would long have been blown...

344
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:57,497
Peace be upon you.

345
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,087
Is Dad alright?

346
00:33:00,574 --> 00:33:02,454
Yes, he's alright.

347
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:33,585
Got engaged?

348
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:47,275
Next time, we'll not invite Molvi Uncle to my engagement.

349
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,498
Yasmin?

350
00:35:21,791 --> 00:35:24,211
She's so sweet!

351
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,342
Where's Dad?

352
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,479
Upstairs in a room.

353
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:34,499
Wait, Afzal.

354
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,752
He's just regained consciousness.

355
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:44,122
He called out to you as he was unconscious.

356
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,729
As he came to,

357
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,439
He got angry at the mention of your name.

358
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:57,443
Take it slowly.

359
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,982
Meet Mum first,

360
00:36:00,517 --> 00:36:02,954
And ask her to let you meet Dad.

361
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,058
He'd left at odds with Dad's orders.

362
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,386
It's as if he'd broken him...

363
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:22,701
Now --

364
00:36:22,701 --> 00:36:25,463
Making amends will take ten or so minutes...

365
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:29,234
But don't worry.

366
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:33,608
He'll meet you the moment he comes to know.

367
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,137
I'll call Mum.

368
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,220
Afzal's here?

369
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,300
