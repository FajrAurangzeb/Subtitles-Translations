1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,759
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,629
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:24,019
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:30,360
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:35,900
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,509
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,100
Here's your tea.

8
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:28,059
Listen!

9
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,520
Yes?

10
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,200
Did he pray at daybreak?

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,250
I went to wake him up. Smiled in his sleep as he glimpsed me.

12
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,120
I thought he was dreaming, so I thought I'd let him.

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,500
I'll wake him up at daybreak tomorrow.

14
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:51,028
I'll get you admitted to the University this time.

15
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:57,347
Ask him when admissions open when he's back from office.

16
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:58,777
But what about

17
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:00,687
Co-education?

18
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,787
So what if it's co-education?

19
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:06,597
Maintaining one's decency is in one's own hands.

20
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:11,127
You come across men even in the markets.

21
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:13,207
Thinking like that,

22
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,917
That's co-education too.

23
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,210
Dad!

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,430
I know when admissions open.

25
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,126
When?

26
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:23,696
The 25th of the next month.

27
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:25,276
Right.

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,719
Would you serve some food? I'm starving.

29
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:05,930
Where's Mum?

30
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,901
Sleeping in her room. Shall I rouse her?

31
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,010
No.

32
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,450
Let her sleep.

33
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,445
Who's calling you repeatedly?

34
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:17,851
No idea.

35
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:19,007
It's an unknown number.

36
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:23,030
Calls again if I disconnect. He's called me some 10 times since the morning.

37
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,912
Talk to him.

38
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,706
I will for real.

39
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,362
So what?

40
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:42,112
Do you feel like insulting someone?

41
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:44,803
Hello?

42
00:03:44,803 --> 00:03:46,005
Where's Farah?

43
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,352
Why isn't she answering the phone?

44
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,712
Who's on the line?

45
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:51,883
You forgot me? Didn't even recognise my voice...

46
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:55,253
Will you keep on with this blather or tell who you are?

47
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,559
It's Mehtab, Lubna...

48
00:03:58,193 --> 00:04:01,242
Oh, Mehtab...

49
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:03,523
Where's Farah?

50
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,282
I've been trying her number. She's not answering.

51
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,914
She keeps her phone on silent mode at the University.

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,574
Want to talk to her?
-Yes, please.

53
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:15,746
I thought she'd have called me by the time I reached Karachi.

54
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,885
Right here, Farah. Mehtab wants to talk.

55
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:23,899
Hello.

56
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,286
It's Mehtab here, Farah.

57
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,066
I've come to know.

58
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,706
You didn't remember me?

59
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:32,346
I did remember you.

60
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:35,445
But I couldn't figure how I'd talk to Dad.

61
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,459
Talk?

62
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,817
To Dad?

63
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,846
What?

64
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,270
You'll know within minutes when I've talked to him.

65
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:45,466
You're the one Dad will call first.

66
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:46,486
So tell me,

67
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,466
How go the preparations for the wedding?

68
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,426
Whose wedding?

69
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,917
Very funny.

70
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,066
I like this one.

71
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,346
Ain't no joke.

72
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,006
I'm seriously asking you -

73
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,706
Whose wedding are you talking about?

74
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,487
Ours, dear, of course!

75
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,506
I find it awkward to answer such a question.

76
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,926
Ohh...

77
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:10,006
The one planned for the 15th of December...

78
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,516
You're talking about it, right?

79
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,326
Again, very funny.

80
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:17,507
You're angry because I didn't call you when I got here?

81
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,797
Ask, for once, why I didn't.

82
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:23,306
I was waiting that you would --
-Look, Mehtab.

83
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,886
It would hurt you to know,

84
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:26,946
But let me be very honest with you -

85
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:28,796
This marriage is unacceptable!

86
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:31,203
The 15th of December you're talking about,

87
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,886
That December will never come!

88
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:36,386
Or that December won't have a 15th!

89
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:38,527
Such fury!

90
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,006
Forgive me.

91
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,476
I was wrong.

92
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,827
What mistake?

93
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:44,277
I made a mistake!

94
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,828
I should've told you before you'd left.

95
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:49,387
But it's alright. I'll tell you now.

96
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,379
Our second meeting on the terrace

97
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:54,679
Was our last meeting.

98
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:56,858
L -- Last meeting?

99
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,987
La finale!

100
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,420
Did Mehtab say something [wrong]?

101
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:17,578
No.

102
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:20,668
I said something.
-Go on.

103
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,701
I told him I'm not marrying him.

104
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,647
That this marriage is unacceptable!

105
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,597
No matter the cost!

106
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,317
Then suffer the consequences.

107
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:30,528
What consequences?

108
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,607
An earful from Dad,

109
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:34,788
And you won't be able to bring yourself to watch Mum's ululation!

110
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,750
I don't worry so much about Mum...

111
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:40,019
But Dad --
-Dad may even slap you!

112
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:42,147
Oh God!

113
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:45,098
What have I done?

114
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:47,258
What if he draws his gun?

115
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,338
Gun?

116
00:06:49,338 --> 00:06:50,511
Don't you remember?

117
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,835
He'd drawn his gun when Aunt...

118
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,121
And fired too.

119
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,510
That's another thing it didn't hit anyone.

120
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,225
But it can't be every single time

121
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,365
That a bullet is fired but does not hit anyone.

122
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:07,435
Where are you going?

123
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,245
To my room.

124
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,935
Stay hidden in my room.

125
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:12,255
What'll hiding do?

126
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,562
Going before them is dangerous.

127
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,122
A bullet can strike

128
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,532
Where a second hit won't be necessary.

129
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:38,904
Afzal!

130
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,965
Afzal!

131
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,354
Come here. Get in.

132
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:51,688
Whose car is this?

133
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,326
My brother's.

134
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:54,466
Get in, quick.

135
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:56,576
Don't go on asking questions.

136
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,146
No.

137
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,426
I'm fine.

138
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:01,336
I'll walk. Thank you.

139
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,226
Why are you saying 'Thank you'?

140
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:05,806
C'mon, get in!

141
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:11,340
I've decided to ride a car home

142
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,586
Only when I've purchased my own.

143
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,156
How will you purchase one?

144
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:18,638
Clerks don't get to own cars.

145
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:38,137
[Call to prayer]

146
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,964
Farah

147
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,884
Don't you think you're taking it for granted?

148
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,053
As, say, with a wedding.

149
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,721
When you're invited to one,

150
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:46,340
You accept it with delight.

151
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,440
And then think,

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,251
'I'll attend if I can spare time',

153
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:53,903
'Otherwise, I'll call and say, 'Sorry, mate, I had some work to do'.'

154
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:55,443
And, as it happens,

155
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:57,533
You're done for.

156
00:09:57,604 --> 00:10:00,833
Don't remind me my mistakes!

157
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:07,028
I'm no Mehtab Chawla

158
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:12,335
To think we have an understanding if you scold me.

159
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,045
Please, Lubna,

160
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,634
I've realised my mistakes.

161
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,967
I should've rejected the proposal before they left.

162
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,964
And if I could not,

163
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,114
Then I shouldn't have phoned Mehtab and said,

164
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,795
'This marriage is unacceptable'!

165
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,997
You're regretting what you did?

166
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:30,185
Obviously.

167
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:33,081
I should've talked to Mum instead of Mehtab Chawla.

168
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,681
No, Madame, you should've talked to Dad.

169
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:36,991
What?

170
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,971
Talking to Mum will get you nowhere.

171
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,241
She'll just say,

172
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,153
'Monseigneur, this girl will drag you through the mire'!

173
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:46,706
If I talk to Dad, he'll actually drag me through a mire!

174
00:10:46,694 --> 00:10:49,274
No way. Dad's not like that.

175
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,139
He'll be a little furious when he hears it.

176
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:52,744
But then ask stenly,

177
00:10:52,744 --> 00:10:54,857
Is that your final decision?

178
00:10:55,214 --> 00:10:56,683
Sure?

179
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:57,964
Be positive!

180
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,884
Just think as if that's going to happen.

181
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,273
Show some sensibility,

182
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:02,764
And when he asks

183
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,184
If this is your final decision,

184
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,493
Say firmly:

185
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,194
'Yes, Dad. It's my final decision'.

186
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,853
He won't slap me?

187
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,823
Good fathers don't slap their young daughters.

188
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,986
Surely he'll ask the reason?

189
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:20,339
Reason?
-He'll surely ask what Mehtab's fault had been.

190
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:21,879
And if there was a fault,

191
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,649
Why I'd not mentioned it before the date was decided upon or before he left?

192
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,119
That's right...

193
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,793
He'll ask that for sure.

194
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,060
What'll you say?

195
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,450
You tell me.

196
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,341
I'm totally blank. I don't know.

197
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh yes!

198
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:55,490
Say the same you did to Mehtab!

199
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:57,581
What did I say to Mehtab?

200
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:01,030
'I love someone else for so long',

201
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,158
'We used to write letters to each other and now talk for hours over the phone'.

202
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,718
I'd say this to Dad?

203
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,642
No. Say this to Mum.

204
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,183
What about the mire, then?

205
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:10,648
Not at all!

206
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:13,979
You'd be deep in the mire by then.

207
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:15,546
I mean

208
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:18,547
You'd have said to Dad that you don't want to marry Mehtab.

209
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:19,726
He'll ask why.

210
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:22,536
Tell him you'd only tell that to Mum.

211
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,880
Yes. That's possible.

212
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,998
But when do I say this?

213
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:31,380
Before he watches the news.

214
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,798
Is there any logical reason?

215
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,190
Of course.

216
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,647
Dad will get to hear all sorts of bad news on the TV,

217
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,817
With your news as the icing on the cake.

218
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:42,267
God, he'll think you're Kamikaze attacking him.

219
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,757
Mademoiselle Farah,

220
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:45,877
Yes?

221
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:48,227
Monseigneur wants you downstairs.

222
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,600
Yes, Dad?

223
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,910
Sit.

224
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,136
Yes, Dad?

225
00:13:57,626 --> 00:14:00,226
You talked to Mehtab today?

226
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,456
Yes, Dad.

227
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:05,476
He called.

228
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:08,316
What did you say when he mentioned the marriage?

229
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,330
Tell me. What did you say?

230
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,069
I -- said

231
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:21,649
That this marriage is unacceptable.

232
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,690
Did he say something wrong?

233
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,864
Not at all -- he just wanted to talk.

234
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:38,950
If you'd much rather that he not call you before the marriage,

235
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,640
I can ask him not to.

236
00:14:41,237 --> 00:14:43,197
It's not that, Dad...

237
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,207
What is it, then?

238
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,927
The fact is --

239
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:51,519
The fault -- was mine.

240
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,770
I should've --

241
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,177
Told you earlier.

242
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,427
What is it that you

243
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,877
Should've told me earlier?

244
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,799
That I --

245
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,457
I don't want to marry Mehtab.
-Couldn't you remember to say it before the date was decided?

246
00:15:19,457 --> 00:15:21,919
Are you bent upon dragging us through the mire?

247
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,359
Don't worry about that.

248
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,516
Just tell me the reason.

249
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,079
I'll tell Mum the reason...

250
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,379
Come with me, then.

251
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,440
What did she say?

252
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,669
She will not marry Mehtab.

253
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,859
Call Mehtab and convey this rejection.

254
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,839
Say that it's not possible now.

255
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:19,800
Why is it not possible?

256
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,639
Because she loves someone else.

257
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,170
Who is he?

258
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:32,900
Should I ask her this too?

259
00:17:32,949 --> 00:17:34,480
Yes.

260
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,292
This isn't something I can ask.

261
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,666
Get all the details from her.

262
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:49,081
Who he is, what he does,

263
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,630
Where does he live,

264
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,648
What his family background is.

265
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,719
What do you mean?

266
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,189
Try to understand, Irsa Begum.

267
00:17:59,189 --> 00:18:01,529
This isn't 1992

268
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,799
That I could try to impose my decision at gunpoint.

269
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,829
If she does not want to marry Mehtab,

270
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:10,689
Alright.

271
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,719
I will decline the proposal.

272
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:18,684
But first, get to know very well from her who he is.

273
00:18:18,684 --> 00:18:21,439
What's his status, family background, and character like?

274
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:25,569
A tad here or there in rank and status is fine by me.

275
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,479
But I shall not compromise

276
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,222
On family background and character.

277
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:51,878
Go to sleep.

278
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:53,418
How do I fall asleep?

279
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,718
Then get ready

280
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:56,858
For you'll be asked in a while

281
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,278
Who it is you love.

282
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,418
Who's the boy,

283
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:00,638
What's his status and rank,

284
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:01,688
What does he do,

285
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:03,913
What's his character like?

286
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,770
Bolt the door.

287
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,250
Bolt the door, please.

288
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,310
And if anyone asks about me,

289
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,891
Say, 'She died the moment the entered'!

290
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,586
It's time for dinner.

291
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:43,166
Have yours.

292
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:45,163
I mean -- Serve everyone.

293
00:19:45,163 --> 00:19:47,123
Farah's not hungry.

294
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:49,183
You're not hungry either?

295
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,674
Why are you asking questions?

296
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:53,654
Go and say that Lubna's not having dinner either.

297
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:08,221
Why don't you go?

298
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,040
Go and see how everything is going on!

299
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,210
Don't be crazy,

300
00:20:11,273 --> 00:20:12,769
Sleep on quietly.

301
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:14,849
I'll say you took sleeping pills if anyone asks.

302
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,409
What'll that do?

303
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:18,690
Buy some time!

304
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,080
Think about his name, address, family, and character.

305
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,660
If there's no one,

306
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,040
Imagine there is.

307
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,099
Name him,

308
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,410
Think about his family

309
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,899
And take it for a given

310
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:32,447
That his character's applauded in all of Hyderabad.

311
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:34,380
If I keep on lying like this,

312
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,550
What'll happen to my character?

313
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,543
Then there's just one way.

314
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,394
Tell me.

315
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:42,531
Tell the truth and marry Mehtab.

316
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:43,754
No way!

317
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:46,471
Then let untruth be your master and say anything you like.

318
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:49,860
It'll ruin your life to worry about your character.

319
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:55,701
Shall we go to the terrace?

320
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:56,701
What's on the terrace?

321
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:57,771
You just have to lie.

322
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:59,251
Sit here and prepare yourself.

323
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:02,692
If you gad about everywhere, you'd be caught before you're prepared.

324
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,541
I'll face whatever comes my way.

325
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,810
Do you know how happy Dad was today?

326
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:46,946
I know.

327
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,606
You don't know.

328
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:52,326
He said, 'Apply to a University'.

329
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,002
What?

330
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:56,491
No way --

331
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:58,190
I swear by you.

332
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,971
It's a golden opportunity, Afzal.

333
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,250
Yes.

334
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,060
Surely, apply.

335
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,640
I'll pay your fees.

336
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,375
I'm not talking about admissions and fees.

337
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,701
Then?

338
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:12,536
Tell me about her.

339
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,299
Who?

340
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,529
The girl who writes letters to you.

341
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:26,459
Just mention her name and address.

342
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,930
I'll talk to Dad.

343
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,899
What'll you talk about?

344
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,839
Won't you marry her?

345
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,772
I'll ask Dad to go and talk to her family.

346
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,230
Ask, first

347
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,369
Will she marry me?

348
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:54,089
Does she write letters to you just for fun?

349
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,900
Just think she does.

350
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:01,241
My marriage to her isn't possible.

351
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:03,300
So,

352
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:06,042
Promise me

353
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,399
You'll never mention her again

354
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:12,556
Nor will you ask her name.

355
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
Just think as if

356
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,190
There is no girl.

357
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,139
There's no name.

358
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,241
Just a dream...

359
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:27,393
That delights me when I imagine it.

360
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:30,140
And if this isn't acceptable either,

361
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,369
Go and ask for Dad's opinion on it.

362
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,079
Ask him

363
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:40,432
If delighting myself with a dream is sinful,

364
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:43,409
I will henceforth not.

365
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,856
Are you friends with anyone from your University?

366
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,906
Shut up!

367
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,696
Do I ever make friends with anyone?

368
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:03,206
Any class fellow

369
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:06,006
Who could be taken into confidence and asked for help?

370
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:08,116
Don't even think about it!

371
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,639
Farhad!

372
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,650
Aunt Mahjabeen's son?
-Yes!

373
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,460
He'll agree in an instant!

374
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,020
That's what we want!

375
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,540
Are you touched in the head?

376
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,440
If I name someone from the family,

377
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,821
I'd have to get married to him.

378
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,610
God forgive

379
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,496
But he's worse than Mehtab!

380
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,620
Don't put up a blank face, missy, find a way out!

381
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,373
Who's talking about his face?

382
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,790
Here I name him,

383
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,930
And there Aunt sets up camp at our place!

384
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:41,977
He should be the type

385
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,007
Who stands firm for four months,

386
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,727
And vanishes within minutes as the moment of the marriage approaches.

387
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:49,567
Oh God, very filmy!

388
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,797
So what if it is filmy?

389
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,317
I'm not marrying Mehtab.

390
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:55,337
No.

391
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:57,317
My heart doesn't agree to it.

392
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,938
In fact, it isn't just about the heart.

393
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:01,537
My mind asks me to be wary!

394
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:05,149
Alright, think about Aunt Mehru's Jamil Akhtar!

395
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:06,901
You're officially gone barmy!

396
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:08,888
Don't even talk about anyone from the family.

397
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:10,172
What, then?

398
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,468
You're not on speaking terms with anyone outside,

399
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:14,608
You've not got eyes for anyone in the family,

400
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,278
Then you've got no option except Barack Obama.

401
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:18,749
What can that poor fellow do?

402
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:23,869
Launch a drone attack on Mehtab's house and resolve the entire matter in a flash.

403
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:25,758
Where are you off to now?

404
00:25:26,918 --> 00:25:28,029
Where would I go?

405
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,579
I'm just checking why Aunt hasn't come yet.

406
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,820
Why would she come?

407
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,770
Splendid.

408
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,180
She's going to come and tell you that Dad's calling you.

409
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:57,598
Over there.

410
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,729
Here he comes.

411
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,796
The Molvi's son.

412
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,278
The bugger's turned into a Molvi himself!

413
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,030
You bugger!

414
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,909
What am I hearing?

415
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:10,957
I'm getting late for work,

416
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:12,577
We'll talk when we meet later.

417
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:14,237
When will we meet?

418
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:17,237
You're giving the thumbs down to your friends

419
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:19,957
For some twopenny-halfpenny job?

420
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:21,227
It's not like that,

421
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:23,069
I promise we'll meet tonight.

422
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:24,357
He's lying!

423
00:26:24,357 --> 00:26:25,537
He's not coming!

424
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:29,197
His Dad's had him swear that he'll never meet Timmy and Sajid!

425
00:26:29,197 --> 00:26:30,009
Innit?

426
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:31,350
That's the matter, right?

427
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,837
No. That's not what it's like.

428
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:36,487
You've got to change yourself to do a job.

429
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:39,057
I've heard you've stopped playing matches.

430
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,208
I'll play.

431
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:43,147
But I'll not gamble on it.

432
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:45,948
Why don't you just say you've been ensnared in your Dad's sermons!

433
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:47,977
I've been ensnared in Dad's sermons!

434
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:51,977
Seeing what I do brought tears to his eyes!

435
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,757
I can't bear to see his tears.

436
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,037
I'm wicked,

437
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,757
But not flagitious.

438
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,922
The sun's come up!

439
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,270
It's 9 already!

440
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,125
Oh my God...

441
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,930
Thank God!

442
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,881
You'll be thrown out of the University!

443
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,970
Get ready quick, Farah! Double time!

444
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,129
I'm thankful it ended there!

445
00:27:58,186 --> 00:28:00,050
Mum must've explained everything.

446
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,849
And Dad must've decided, too

447
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,290
'Even if she loves someone',

448
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,249
'We'll talk some other day'.

449
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:09,630
I'll offer two additional prayers when I'm back

450
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,570
In fact, I'll offer all my prayers!

451
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,319
What are you looking at?

452
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,829
Go to your room and get ready, quick!

453
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,020
I'm going!

454
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,760
I know I'm late!

455
00:28:26,786 --> 00:28:28,226
Good morning!

456
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:29,573
Good morning!

457
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,490
I've called to apologise.

458
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,300
Mum called and told me

459
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,417
I was left screaming in horror; after all, it's between us; we'll resolve it together.

460
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,487
Where's your Mum?

461
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:41,978
No --

462
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:44,598
I swear, it's not Mum's fault either.

463
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,188
It's just she talked to a friend, and --

464
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:49,198
She suggested it.

465
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:51,878
Where's your Mum's friend?

466
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,177
Hey!

467
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:55,888
You don't even know her.

468
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:56,807
Besides,

469
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,418
What will you say to her?

470
00:28:58,418 --> 00:29:00,048
I'll thank her.

471
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:01,607
Say a big 'Thank you' to her.

472
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:02,698
And

473
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:04,748
Thank you very much too!

474
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:08,948
I was growing anxious how I could talk about it to Mum and Dad.

475
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,768
So sweet of you!

476
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,558
Alright, disconnect now.

477
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:14,608
I'm getting late for my classes!

478
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,290
Peace be upon you.

479
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:46,381
Please sign this photocopy

480
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:47,804
And confirm the receipt of this letter.

481
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:48,831
Letter?

482
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:50,501
It's a memo.

483
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:51,615
What's a memo?

484
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:54,004
You'll find out when you read it.

485
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,326
Read it after you've signed this.

486
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,350
Please don't talk to me about anything!

487
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,811
Talk to me!

488
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,951
I've signed the memo.

489
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,866
What's this you've written?

490
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:34,676
That I t -- tease Miss Rosy, I --

491
00:30:34,676 --> 00:30:37,556
Pester her, harrass her?

492
00:30:37,556 --> 00:30:39,206
Can you see this?

493
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,590
Miss Rosy has complained against you.

494
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:48,606
Look at me, mate!

495
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:51,745
I've been easy on you when writing that.

496
00:30:51,745 --> 00:30:53,406
Miss Rosy had also mentioned

497
00:30:53,406 --> 00:30:56,206
That she fears for her honour in your presence!

498
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:57,816
In my presence?

499
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,029
Over here!

500
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,509
I've even come to know the thing about the injury.

501
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,089
Be thankful

502
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:13,340
I did not write this Fescennine story in the memo!

503
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,876
Fescennine story?

504
00:31:14,876 --> 00:31:16,260
The thing about the injury --

505
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,209
What about the injury?

506
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,319
Have some shame.

507
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,710
You thumb a lift from a girl,

508
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:26,273
And try to assault her?

509
00:31:26,356 --> 00:31:28,356
I'm ashamed to think of it!

510
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:30,316
You're the son of a priest.

511
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:34,036
Look at your father's dignity and honour, and fear for yourself!

512
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,657
Yes?

513
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:39,769
Yes sir.

514
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:41,407
Coming, sir.

515
00:31:43,357 --> 00:31:44,486
Come.

516
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,717
Where?

517
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,627
Monseigneur has called you.

518
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:48,823
And beware!

519
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,334
Don't try to lie before him!

520
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:52,717
Come.

521
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,380
Listen, Farah.

522
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,220
Come here.

523
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:21,706
Yes, Mum?

524
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,836
Tell him to come and meet your father.

525
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:26,036
Who?

526
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,727
What's his name?

527
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,046
Name?

528
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,239
Don't be afraid.

529
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:36,017
Your father has said that if he's from a good family and of good character, he has no problem.

530
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:40,146
A tad here or there in rank and status is fine by him.

531
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,850
I told you, you've nothing to fear.

532
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,509
Call him here.

533
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,369
You don't believe me?

534
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,820
Alright,

535
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,360
Go to the University for now; call me when you believe me and tell me when he'll be coming.

536
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,320
It

537
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,491
Would be better if he came in the evening.

538
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:10,280
Get a move on!

539
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:23,378
What is all of this?

540
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:25,387
It's all a lie, sir.

541
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,028
Get the girl here, Mr Chengezi.

542
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:29,468
Please wait, sir...

543
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:33,205
Why are you calling her here?

544
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,106
So that she can say all of this to my face?

545
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:38,267
I accept that she'd have said it.

546
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:42,795
And I accept that Mr Chengezi reported it to you because she'd said it.

547
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:45,545
But I want to ask one thing, sir.

548
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:48,875
If what that girl has said is given to be true, why is what I say necessarily a lie?

549
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:52,485
I saw you get in the car with her with my own eyes.

550
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:55,545
And that bandage on her head - she's shown me the wound.

551
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:57,955
A wound half an inch wide!

552
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,895
Is this proof that I'm lying, sir?

553
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:02,835
Do you know where you're standing?

554
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:04,595
And whom you're blabbing before?

555
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,330
I've come to realise today where I stand, sir.

556
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,310
I have nothing to say but that I'm not the culprit.

557
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,313
You may pronounce whatever decision you see fit.

558
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:19,009
I have great respect for your father.

559
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:21,853
He leads my prayers.

560
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,218
I'd given you this job on his request.

561
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:30,378
And do you know what he'd said when he recommended you?

562
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:33,038
He'd have said, 'My son is not virtuous, sir'.

563
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:37,509
'He gambles on matches, smokes weed with his vagabond friends'.

564
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:43,799
But he wouldn't have said, 'My son does not respect the dignity and honour of women'.

565
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,609
That's the one vice I don't have, sir.

566
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:54,551
Perhaps, trusting my inculpability from this transgression, my father used to forgive every trespass of mine.

567
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,659
I hereby resign from this job, sir.

568
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:03,026
For the first time, I am not the offender.

569
00:35:03,026 --> 00:35:06,916
But I've got a feeling I am.

570
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:11,436
Please do mention this crime of mine when you meet Dad.

571
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:15,989
I, too, want to see, sir,

572
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:20,160
How much Dad distrusts me.

573
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,930
With peace, sir.

574
00:35:26,536 --> 00:35:28,546
He's just being dramatic, sir.

575
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:07,076
Did you

576
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,895
Wake him up at daybreak?

577
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:10,217
I didn't need to!

578
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:12,186
He was praying when I entered his room.

579
00:36:12,186 --> 00:36:13,706
He's awakened now, Dad.

580
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:17,207
There's no need to knock and wake him up now.

581
00:36:17,796 --> 00:36:19,796
Do you

582
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:22,720
Remember Hazrat Sahib?

583
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,076
Of course.

584
00:36:24,076 --> 00:36:26,296
When he was young,

585
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:29,426
He used to seat him in his lap.

586
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:32,016
He loved him so much.

587
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,686
He would turn his gaze to me and say,

588
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:37,407
'Remember, Subhanallah',

589
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:40,216
'He'll grow to become a great man one day'.

590
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:43,237
Take him to his grave someday

591
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,456
And say to him, 'Bless you'.

592
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:47,596
'What you said has come true'.

593
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,016
With blessings, your son has become a clerk.

594
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:53,206
What do you say, Ruqaiyya Begum?

595
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:55,736
That's how everything starts.

596
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:58,746
A tree does not grow tall in one day.

597
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,686
Take me, for example.

598
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,536
When I got married to you,

599
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,126
What was I?

600
00:37:04,126 --> 00:37:06,426
And what are you now?

601
00:37:08,016 --> 00:37:10,826
You just became a Molvi, Molvi Sahab.

602
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:13,766
You couldn't become a great man.

603
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:18,466
There is no other power [but God's]!

604
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:21,926
Hello?

605
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:22,920
Hello!

606
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,956
How are you, sire?

607
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:25,656
How goes your job?

608
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:26,516
Good!

609
00:38:26,516 --> 00:38:27,516
Very good!

610
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,136
Ohh...

611
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:32,797
You're speaking English to proclaim your majesty!

612
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:37,091
My dear, show your majesty through your work. Many can speak English 'round here.

613
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:40,109
I'm doing a lot of work...

614
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,490
What's that noise?

615
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,600
Noise --?

616
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,529
The TV's on.

617
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,189
Mr Chengezi has a thing for the matches.

618
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:52,849
So he's like you!

619
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:53,879
Yes.

620
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,360
When's the break?

621
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,470
Break?

622
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,910
I mean when do you have your lunch?

623
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,669
Why don't you ask straight away?

624
00:39:01,669 --> 00:39:04,340
I have my lunch when I'm hungry.

625
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,110
Hey? It's 2 p.m!

626
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,313
You're not feeling hungry?

627
00:39:07,313 --> 00:39:08,549
Oh?

628
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:09,949
It's 2?

629
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,939
Alright. Quickly now, have your lunch.

630
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:14,477
I know you've got a lot of work. Keep on doing it.

631
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,440
But take care of your health.

632
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,799
I'll eat in a while.

633
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:20,560
And remember to offer your middle prayers.

634
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,359
Dad feels good to hear about it.

635
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:25,869
I will.

636
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:26,849
Alright.

637
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:28,949
I'll disconnect then.

638
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
