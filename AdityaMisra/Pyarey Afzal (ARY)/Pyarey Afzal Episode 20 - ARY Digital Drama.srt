1
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:13,677
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:18,881
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:24,009
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,448
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:35,877
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:40,580
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,945
I'm afraid.

8
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,407
That's good.

9
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,997
What do you mean?

10
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:26,429
You're saying it's good that I'm afraid?

11
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:28,565
Do you know why I'm afraid?

12
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,587
I do.

13
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:35,280
You're afraid he's married the Farah from the letters,

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,366
And you think he'd come back from Karachi

15
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:41,840
With two of his kids.

16
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:45,210
And you're also afraid

17
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,146
That the kids would recognise you instantly,

18
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:49,981
And, calling you 'Aunt', embrace you.

19
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,665
Why would they embrace me?

20
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:56,270
And how can they recognise me?

21
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,682
Farah,

22
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:01,140
One never forgets

23
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,852
The one who wounds him.

24
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:05,276
So, your name would be mentioned often

25
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:09,570
Before Farah and the kids.

26
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,466
There!

27
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,351
You're getting goosebumps, aren't you?

28
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:14,700
Do you know what that means?

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,214
What does it mean?

30
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:16,801
Well,

31
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,493
You know what it means, too.

32
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:23,200
You're wishing that you die before seeing that day.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,283
Which day?

34
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:24,960
C'mon, mate,

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,399
Don't act so innocent.

36
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,917
One gets the chills when one's so perturbed.

37
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:29,953
God forgive...

38
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,770
However did you even think that

39
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,870
He'd marry the Farah from the letters,

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,350
And he'd have two kids who'd - God forbid -

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,630
Call you 'Aunt' the moment they see you?

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,482
Get out.

43
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,288
Think again,

44
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:41,323
I'd actually leave.

45
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:44,644
Remember how you'd pleaded with me to get me here?

46
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:47,186
I'm not my problem; you are!

47
00:02:47,186 --> 00:02:50,272
I'm going to the psychiatrist in the morning because of you.

48
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:54,073
Dad's booked an appointment in the evening. He's seeing the same doctor.

49
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,021
What happened to him?

50
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:57,350
I'd told you...

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,870
He thinks his brain's been french fried.

52
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,445
That's a problem with his English.

53
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:04,209
Otherwise, he's alright.

54
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,205
You're laughing, aren't you?

55
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:08,838
Wait,

56
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,937
I may just curse you!

57
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,064
Hey!

58
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:12,774
I'll say,

59
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:14,670
'May you be in my condition',

60
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,190
'Stumbling around restlessly',

61
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,450
'Living, but not alive',

62
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,473
'Mortified, but not quite dead'!

63
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:21,634
Oh...

64
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:25,170
So that's how you're feeling...

65
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,810
And

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,640
You didn't say a word.

67
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,968
I'm telling you now.

68
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,824
I'm cursing you, too.

69
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,557
Thank you, Farah.

70
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,993
You're thanking me now,

71
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:36,060
But you'll get your deserts later.

72
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,243
That's what they all say,

73
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,201
'You'll get your deserts when you fall in love'.

74
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:41,701
But this knave called 'love' never got me!

75
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,830
Who's talking about love?

76
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,042
You're dancing around as love itself,

77
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,800
And you're asking who's talking about love!

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,350
By the Lord, you lassie,

79
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,172
However do I tell you I don't love him!

80
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm even feeling sad

81
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,530
Over why I didn't marry Mehtab.

82
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,680
I dragged principles in for no reason,

83
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Otherwise, he was right -

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,180
Who goes to London to study after getting married?

85
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,670
Should I call him?

86
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,700
Mehtab?

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,763
Of course.

88
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,306
The poor lad would've gotten up.

89
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,957
He'd be shivering right now.

90
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,797
May the Lord keep him happy.

91
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:19,678
Hey!

92
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,091
Why are you throwing your responsibility onto the Lord?

93
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,643
If you've realised your mistake, just call for once.

94
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,779
Marry him, take him along to London, and keep him happy.

95
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,330
I'll meet him when I'd go to Karachi.

96
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,579
Oh...

97
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,322
So you're going to Karachi?

98
00:04:33,322 --> 00:04:35,332
I might as well.

99
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:37,095
If I understood what Mehtab said,

100
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:40,057
I'd definitely go to Karachi.

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,748
Why are you laughing?

102
00:04:45,748 --> 00:04:47,339
For God's sake, Farah,

103
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,800
You'd go to Rawalpindi, too, if only Afzal went there.

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,054
Just look at how

105
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,757
You've started respecting Mehtab for him.

106
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:55,685
Lubna!

107
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,074
You'd better leave.

108
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:58,449
Leave it be.

109
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:00,978
You'd be left afraid and alone here if I went away.

110
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:03,650
I won't be afraid.

111
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Think over it, Farah Ibrahim,

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,270
You're taking a risk.

113
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,819
I know fully well

114
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,180
That lost love becomes a ghost

115
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,375
That presents itself here or there.

116
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,370
Who?

117
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,768
Afzal, of course.

118
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:20,488
C'mon,

119
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,010
Get out!

120
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,079
Okay, fine.

121
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,655
Close the doors and windows.

122
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,990
Although doors and windows do little to deter ghosts,

123
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,060
It just satisfies one's heart.

124
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,840
Okay?

125
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,866
Good night.
-[Call to the morning prayer]

126
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,582
[Call to the morning prayer]
-Oh, sorry...

127
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,561
[Call to the morning prayer]
-Good morning.

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:56,560
[Call to the morning prayer]

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,590
You've kept God busy, Ruqaiyya Begum.

130
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,658
He

131
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:17,421
Looks after everyone's children.

132
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,420
He will take care of your son, too.

133
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,937
Don't worry.

134
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,626
He'd better.

135
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,430
There's no power but God's!

136
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,610
This thing about 'He'd better' isn't exactly

137
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,806
Proper.

138
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,582
Your coming between the Lord and me is not proper either, Molvi Sahab.

139
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,932
Please be kind enough

140
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,870
As to leave the Lord with His woman,

141
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,300
Beyond the Molvi's control.

142
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,357
Whatever are you

143
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,980
Saying, Ruqaiyya Begum?

144
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,480
What could I do, Molvi Sahab?

145
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,640
A mother's courage is most unlike that of the Lord.

146
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,830
Nothing that is His ever gets lost,

147
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,543
But mothers' sons do get lost.

148
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,100
That's why I've been chanting requests -

149
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,320
'If You remember Your love for Your creation',

150
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,400
'Don't ever forget a mother's love for her son'.
-God forgive!

151
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,570
Does He ever forget?

152
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,760
That's it.

153
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,810
That's what I'm asking.

154
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,470
'Did You forget it when it was my turn'?

155
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,180
Your mother's saying words of disbelief!

156
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,020
There's never disbelief in a mother's words, Dad.

157
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,889
The one who gives birth to children is talking to the one who gave birth to all of creation.

158
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,451
She'd know how to talk.

159
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,705
Is it that the two of you leave me speechless now,

160
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:31,060
Or is it that the one who's left

161
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,980
Has taken my words with him?

162
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,830
But remember, Ruqaiyya Begum,

163
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,240
If there's so much as a speck on the honour of God's own,

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,496
Miracles happen.

165
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,980
Listen, Molvi Sahab,

166
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,370
Mothers pray for miracles in their helplessness.

167
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,660
It's an obligation on God's own to do something worth showing Him.

168
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,970
Then save your prayers.

169
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,040
Every day, to do something worth showing,

170
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,300
I go to watch cricket.

171
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,740
I spend the entire afternoon there,

172
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,372
At the playground where your Afzal

173
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:17,329
Used to play matches he'd gamble over.

174
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:20,359
If I got wind of his whereabouts,

175
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,926
I'd be at his doorstep one of these days.

176
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,100
And

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't be so selfish in your sorrow

178
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,870
As for forget the pain of Afzal's father.

179
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,960
Just think

180
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,050
You're tormented in one way,

181
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,482
And I'm tormented in another.

182
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,666
Arifa!

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,370
Come and shut the door.

184
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,226
The Molvi

185
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:03,283
Is going to fulfil his fatherly duties.

186
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,220
What --

187
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,550
What's up with the people?

188
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,060
Why are they saluting me?

189
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,570
Why are they calling me 'Afzal Bhai'?
-The cowards are so helpless --

190
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,290
Peace be upon you, Afzal Bhai!

191
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,270
How are you, sir? Would you like to have some tea, sir? A cold drink?
-I'm fine.

192
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,860
No, thank you very much.

193
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,792
Okay, sir.

194
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,400
They refer to their oul fella as 'Bhai'.

195
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,420
Whatever does that mean?

196
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,380
Why are you so tensed? If they salute you, just greet them back.
-But --

197
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,010
Why are they greeting and saluting me now? They never used to.

198
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,390
And I didn't quite get this one about the oul fella and 'Bhai'.

199
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,030
Alright, come. I'll tell you.

200
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,776
How are you?
-I'm fine.

201
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:07,196
Greetings, sir! How are you?

202
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,929
Go on.

203
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,782
Tell me.

204
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,480
What do these sudden salutes mean?

205
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,130
Why were they calling me 'Afzal Bhai'?

206
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,900
Sit.

207
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,332
Cripes, mate...

208
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,310
Be done with this chapter of 'sit', 'stand up', 'I'll tell you at home'.

209
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,110
Just get to the point.

210
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,320
How tall are you?

211
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,270
You're asking about my height?

212
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,861
Just tell me how tall you are; I'll answer your question.

213
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,416
5' 11".

214
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,518
5' 11"...

215
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,519
Weight?

216
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,877
Again?

217
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:52,667
Tell me your weight.

218
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:54,940
81 kg.

219
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,270
Now, look around and tell me how many lads

220
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,610
Are above 5' 11"

221
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,838
And 81 kg.

222
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:10,326
You'd find more than a handful.

223
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,300
And when all of these lived here

224
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,923
Even before you came,

225
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,970
Why would girls have to fear for their honour

226
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,834
Before a 5' 11" hoodlum like yourself?

227
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:30,280
Because measuring one's height and weight does not tell anything about how much courage a man's got.

228
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,810
Hoodlums are not made by their capabilities,

229
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,080
But by the fear and cowardice in the hearts of people.

230
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,664
The one whom people fear

231
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:44,920
Becomes a hoodlum.

232
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:51,460
Tell me about the salutes.

233
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,370
Why were they saluting me?

234
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,845
The people have begun to fear you because they think you're a bigger hoodlum than Wali.

235
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,942
What?

236
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,622
One surprised 'What' isn't going to change the ways of the city.
-Here.

237
00:14:05,622 --> 00:14:08,740
Here's your lunch.

238
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,260
So much?

239
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,650
It's not so much.

240
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,330
There's just many dishes.

241
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,020
What've you got?

242
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,830
Potato, meat, chicken ginger, and mixed vegetable.

243
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,741
Why are you looking at each other like that?

244
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,997
Sit and have some, and tell me how it is.

245
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,150
I've cooked the chicken ginger.

246
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,010
Yes, it's good. Good.

247
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,340
You're saying without even tasting!

248
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,947
No, it looks good.

249
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,520
When did you see it?

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,870
There's a lid on the top.

251
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,955
Looking at your face, one can tell that the chicken ginger you've cooked is delicious!
-There, now!

252
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,100
And what are you doing, looking at me like that?

253
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,450
Just a spot of lipstick's got you stunned!

254
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,380
Well,

255
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,900
That isn't something I could say myself.

256
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,542
Mam's told me not to.

257
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,470
How say you tell me -

258
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,732
How does this lipstick look?

259
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:16,326
It -- I -- It's good.

260
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,310
So you think

261
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,170
You've been sent

262
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,120
Here as part of a conspiracy against you,

263
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,680
And you're otherwise perfectly normal.

264
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,027
Of course.

265
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,062
Know what,

266
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:46,390
I'm the first girl in my family

267
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,560
Who's seeing a psychiatrist for her treatment.

268
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,861
Do you know why?

269
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:52,190
Why?

270
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,430
Because they think of psychiatrists as aliénistes in my family.

271
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,190
Aye?

272
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,040
'Aye' as in?

273
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,550
Is it right?

274
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,881
Naw at all!

275
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,470
So,

276
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,950
You were saying

277
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,860
That Lubna's your younger sister?

278
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,670
Yes.

279
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,130
And who's this Afzal?

280
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,660
Afzal?

281
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,550
I didn't even mention his name.

282
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,350
I get it!

283
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,120
You've been briefed before I came here.

284
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,450
Naw at all, you've named him five times in twenty minutes.

285
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,930
How could that be?

286
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,570
I shut up even so much as a thought of him.

287
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:33,160
Why do you think of him?

288
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,960
I mean, who is he to you?

289
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,940
Hold your horses, Monsieur le Docteur!

290
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,000
He's nobody to me!

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,850
Lubna's best friend is Arifa,

292
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,120
And he's her brother.

293
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,860
An ace loafer and wastrel.

294
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,020
Just last month

295
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,580
He gambled one last time

296
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,670
And ran away from the city.

297
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,730
Oh!

298
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,980
Where'd he go?

299
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,140
No idea.

300
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,460
But I've heard he's gone to Karachi.

301
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,360
I also know why he would've gone there.

302
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,737
Why would he have gone there?

303
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,883
Don't you think it's

304
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:07,270
Something I have nothing to do with?

305
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,784
Aye, right, you don't,

306
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:09,940
But...

307
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,480
I thought I might as well ask

308
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,537
Now that you've mentioned it.

309
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,526
He's having an affair with a girl.

310
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:19,766
He's eloped with her.

311
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:22,316
Do you want to know the girl's name?

312
00:17:22,316 --> 00:17:23,841
Please.

313
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,921
You'd laugh.

314
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:26,724
Naw,

315
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,163
I promise.

316
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,630
Farah!

317
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,590
That blighter's name is Farah, too!

318
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,030
His parents are very sad...

319
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,730
It pains me to see them.

320
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,700
So, you pay them a visit now and then?

321
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,320
No, Monsieur le Docteur!

322
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,900
It's nothing like that.

323
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,070
I just felt, for once,

324
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,730
That I'm partly to blame for his leaving, too.

325
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,920
So, I went over to give them some comfort.

326
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,550
Why did you feel so?

327
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,380
I mean, if you shut up so much as a thought of him,

328
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,510
How could you be responsible for his leaving?

329
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,410
Leave it be, Monsieur le Docteur.

330
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,440
It's a long story...

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,020
I have no problems; I can listen to long stories.

332
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,680
I think

333
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,364
It's quite personal.

334
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,890
Look,

335
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,770
Nothing's personal when seeing a psychiatrist.

336
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,260
Everything the patient tells is strictly confidential.

337
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,440
'Patient'?

338
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,150
You're calling me your patient?

339
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,110
Uh -- Naw -- It was a slip of the tongue...

340
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,380
I meant,

341
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,760
We call those who consult us for advice our patients.

342
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,590
Oh...

343
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,920
But you won't call me your patient now.

344
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,140
Sure.

345
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,870
Right.

346
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,810
The story begins

347
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,770
With Mum getting me engaged to one Mehtab.

348
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,140
The lad's an ace bounder.

349
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,730
I'd agreed to it in the beginning,

350
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,330
But when I interviewed him after the engagement,

351
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,630
I realised

352
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,230
That --

353
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,450
His intentions aren't right!

354
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,970
What were his intentions?

355
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,300
Well,

356
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,410
I won't tell you everything.

357
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,910
Just think

358
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,740
That he had no intention to work even after getting married.

359
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,210
However would he get his two square meals if he didn't work?

360
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,070
He has no issues with that.

361
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,860
He's got millions lying in the bank,

362
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,520
And he gets his share from that.

363
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
But I

364
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,600
Curse a lad like that,

365
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,490
Who'd keep millions in a vault

366
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,860
And make a show of having a jolly good time before the poorer ones!

367
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,180
Seeing you, one can't possibly tell you're among the 'poorer ones'.

368
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,410
Monsieur le Docteur, what are you saying?

369
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,650
If only my Dad wanted to,

370
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,800
He could buy the likes of Mehtab in a moment.

371
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Okay, okay.

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,220
Please, go on.

373
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,390
What happened next

374
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,660
Has brought me before you.

375
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,890
Just think

376
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,655
As if I've made one foolish mistake.

377
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,220
Peace be upon you, Dad.

378
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,544
And upon you, peace. Where are you?

379
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:02,620
At the psychiatrist's clinic.

380
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,500
So you actually went there!

381
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,407
I couldn't believe it when your Mum told me.

382
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,020
Where is she?

383
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,250
She's with the doctor. It's been an hour.

384
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,280
She was alright, wasn't she?

385
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,850
She was, Dad.

386
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,710
Seeing the patients at the clinic, she said,

387
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,520
'I can't see a single mad man here'.

388
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,610
Tell her to talk to me when she comes back.

389
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,990
I will, sure.

390
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,040
But...

391
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,580
But what?

392
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,840
She isn't going to get cured.

393
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,090
Are you alright?

394
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,000
She went there just casually; otherwise, whatever is wrong with her?

395
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,650
Nothing's wrong with her, Dad.

396
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:41,020
But she isn't ready to be cured yet.

397
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,160
What's this logic, mate?

398
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,200
Do you know what you're saying?

399
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,730
I'm telling the truth, Dad.

400
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,700
She's come to the psychiatrist because she, too, knows that she's --
-The psychiatrist will help her with her condition.

401
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,320
I've heard he's a very intelligent doctor.

402
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,398
He listens for hours to what the patient says, and solves it within moments.

403
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:04,011
Let's hope for the best.

404
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:05,915
Okay, Dad,

405
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:07,524
Bye.

406
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:09,082
Okay.

407
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,070
There was such a scene

408
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,760
When he brought his family along for the engagement.

409
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,670
And guess what,

410
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,880
They even had the engagement ring with them!

411
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,490
His Dad took it out from his pocket and showed it.

412
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,475
And, Monsieur le Docteur, it was the bleeding limit

413
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:31,760
That my Mum and Dad were chuffed, too!

414
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,934
They didn't even think

415
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,325
How a girl like Farah

416
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:37,691
Could ever even think about a wastrel like Afzal!

417
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,049
What happened, then?

418
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,311
What could've happened?

419
00:21:40,311 --> 00:21:42,445
As if I'm meek as a lamb,

420
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:44,871
And I'd go along with him, bleating!

421
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,172
Right at the time of the engagement,

422
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,676
I exposed him!

423
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:51,640
I shoved the engagement ring in his face.

424
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,450
As in, right in his face?

425
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,614
No.

426
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,660
As in, refused to get engaged.

427
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,737
I showed him his place right there and then.

428
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:00,643
So, to speak,

429
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:03,020
'Shoved the ring in his face'.

430
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,710
Oh, so you were saying it just as an idiom...

431
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,650
Of course...

432
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:10,350
He'd be hiding his face in shame, then?

433
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:12,090
No, Monsieur le Docteur.

434
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,650
He left Hyderabad after that.

435
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,320
And honestly?

436
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,060
I did feel sorrow at his leaving.

437
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,460
Why did you feel sorrow?

438
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,250
I mean,

439
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,550
Why would you feel sorrow for such a man?

440
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,040
His family's missing him a lot.

441
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,520
Looking at them,

442
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,590
I torment in pain, too.

443
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,880
That's strange...

444
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,940
He's having a ball in Karachi,

445
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,710
And people are tormented here for him.

446
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,950
Please, Monsieur le Docteur,

447
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,130
Don't say that.

448
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,290
Don't say what?

449
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,980
That he's having a ball in Karachi.

450
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,930
That's not what Dad thinks.

451
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,510
Forget about Daddy, tell me what you think.

452
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,190
The thing is,

453
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,820
Seeing him, one doesn't really feel he'd be that type.

454
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,100
Besides his habit of gambling,

455
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,470
There isn't any other vice he has, really.

456
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,460
He'd even been acquitted in the case with Rosy.

457
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,990
Who's Rosy?

458
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,340
She was a blighter.

459
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,710
It came up later

460
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,020
That she was drooling over him.

461
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,360
Dad ousted her.

462
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,300
Oh...

463
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,970
So she worked for you.

464
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,460
Interesting story,

465
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,065
And funny as well...

466
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:17,284
Innit?

467
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:18,615
Alright, tell me,

468
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:22,040
Are you in the same condition now?

469
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,894
What condition?

470
00:23:23,894 --> 00:23:27,354
The same - you shutting up even so much as a thought of him.

471
00:23:27,354 --> 00:23:29,560
Do you shut it up even now?

472
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,090
No.

473
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,530
If he comes to my mind,

474
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,030
I think about him...

475
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:39,040
What, for example, do you think?

476
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,240
That he should come back to Hyderabad now.

477
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,000
It's better if he live here.

478
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,240
Why is it better for you?

479
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,550
I'm not talking about myself, Monsieur le Docteur.

480
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,998
If he stayed before his parents' eyes,

481
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,070
It'd give them peace.

482
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,173
How noble your thoughts are...

483
00:23:54,173 --> 00:23:56,850
He ought to come back now.

484
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,400
But what if he didn't?

485
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,990
He'd have to, Monsieur le Docteur!

486
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,850
Molvi Subhanallah's prayers won't go to waste!

487
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,733
And with his Mum having the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties] recited,

488
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,527
How much longer could he keep running away?

489
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,895
Plus, I've vowed to offer 100 additional prayers.

490
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:15,010
You don't know, Monsieur le Docteur,

491
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,889
My wish gets fulfilled

492
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:20,490
Just after I offer 12 of them.

493
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,190
At least tell me what the doctor said.

494
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,643
I will,

495
00:24:58,643 --> 00:25:00,600
But promise me

496
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,299
That if you ever had such a problem,

497
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,110
You'd never go to a psychiatrist.

498
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,320
Why? What happened?

499
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,991
These psychiatrists are right wizards,

500
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:15,721
They even ask things one wouldn't even tell one's Mum and Dad.

501
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,180
So he asked you everything?

502
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,907
Yes...

503
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:21,790
And you told everything?

504
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,180
Quickly.

505
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,984
Then?

506
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:26,254
What did he tell you about the treatment?

507
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:27,614
Treatment?

508
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:30,011
So you think I'd gone there to get treated?

509
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:30,706
Do you know,

510
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:33,086
He called me a 'patient' by mistake.

511
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:36,540
He apologised for it.

512
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,112
So that means going there didn't help at all.

513
00:25:39,112 --> 00:25:40,981
No, it did help.

514
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:43,188
He's told me not to silence any thought of him.

515
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:45,239
He said there's nothing wrong about it.

516
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:47,024
This reasoning is right, too.

517
00:25:47,024 --> 00:25:49,109
He said you need to let his thoughts enter before getting them to exit.

518
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:51,630
How would they get out if you never let them in?

519
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,052
Whose thoughts?

520
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,800
Of Afzal, of course.

521
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,275
So you told him that you think about Afzal?

522
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,374
I don't think about him.

523
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,910
I just have an occasional thought of him.

524
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,660
Blimey...

525
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,638
Is there anything wrong with that?

526
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:09,610
No.

527
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,341
There's nothing wrong with it.

528
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:14,238
But tell me, what would you tell Mum and Dad?

529
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:16,220
What would I say to them?

530
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,120
Dad called me when I was there.

531
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,520
He asked me to call when leaving the clinic.

532
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,170
Mum's asked thrice, too,

533
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,620
'Why is it taking so long'?

534
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,820
I said, 'The treatment's taking time'.

535
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,892
'Treatment'?

536
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:27,745
Yes --

537
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:30,740
I said whatever came to my mind.

538
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,580
But be prepared with your answer.

539
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,270
Think of what you'd say when Mum and Dad would ask.

540
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,710
Would you tell the truth or lie?

541
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,510
What do I tell them if I tell them the truth?

542
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,685
Just say that

543
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:43,480
You think of Afzal.

544
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,844
I'd never tell that!

545
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:49,519
Well, you never told me about that either.

546
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,979
By the way, what kind of thoughts do you have?

547
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,000
Romantic, or

548
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,662
The bland desi type [South Asian, unsophisticated]?

549
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:59,184
As if I'd romance Afzal!

550
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,566
You wouldn't, sure, but thoughts come as they please.

551
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:05,520
Who knows, you may have had one one day, in a romantic mood?

552
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,249
Shut up!

553
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,963
Honestly, though, Farah,

554
00:27:08,963 --> 00:27:12,730
It is about time you brought out the sly lass hiding behind your veil of innocence,

555
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,940
And say openly, 'I won't leave anyone in peace until I've found peace myself'.

556
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,560
What does this mean?

557
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,816
You crazy lass,

558
00:27:20,816 --> 00:27:22,300
Why are you toying with yourself?

559
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,200
If you love Afzal, just say that you love him.

560
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Nobody will say anything to you.

561
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,550
For God's sake, Lubna,

562
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,280
I don't love Afzal!

563
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,510
At least think before you say something!

564
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,390
Matching me with Afzal --

565
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,540
No!

566
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,659
Never!

567
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,277
What happened?

568
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:53,078
Can't you believe it?

569
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,500
Not one bit.

570
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,066
Am I lying?

571
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,360
You're not lying,

572
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,430
But you don't know the truth.

573
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,810
And it pains me to say

574
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,740
That the day you come to know the truth

575
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,420
Would be the day I'd say,

576
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,221
'You're lying'.

577
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,228
In that case, why don't you get this mirror out of here?

578
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:54,562
Here's your tea.

579
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,760
If my eyes fall on it while passing by, I take a look.

580
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,916
I'll say it straight, Mam,

581
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:05,050
Who doesn't like a pretty face?

582
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,183
Have your tea.

583
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,320
He's over 25 for sure.

584
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,980
At this age, a man with a fair face has already found a girl for himself.

585
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,980
What would you do if he told you that he's found one for himself?

586
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,578
He may have.

587
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:27,240
As if I bother!

588
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,927
Your bothered self

589
00:29:28,927 --> 00:29:32,360
Would be visible in the mirror, then.

590
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,530
You wouldn't say, then,

591
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,990
'Get this mirror out, Mam'.

592
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,130
You'd say, 'Destroy this mirror'.

593
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,424
Have your tea.

594
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,618
Give me one, too.

595
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,751
A cigarette?

596
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,401
Yes.

597
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:11,404
Why?

598
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:12,271
Nothing, really.

599
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,800
Just feel like smoking.

600
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,870
Just get to the point and tell me what's in your heart.

601
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,050
The job as a security guard, you know...

602
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,730
I've agreed to do that.

603
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,640
As in,

604
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,300
We'd go to your friend tomorrow.

605
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,980
I'd apologise to him, and you can talk about the job.

606
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,584
But tell him I won't have my hair cut.

607
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:36,580
Are you enlisting in the army that you'd have your hair cut?

608
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,690
Don't worry; I'll talk to him.

609
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,469
May --

610
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:43,089
May I sleep?

611
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,180
Sure.

612
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,510
Go to sleep.

613
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,057
She won't come by herself,

614
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:09,227
You could've climbed up the stairs and asked her.

615
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, she'd only lie to me.

616
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,510
Who taught her to lie?

617
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,073
Only girls who conceal their heart's secrets from their mothers

618
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:20,030
Go to see psychiatrists.

619
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,850
Brilliant. That was rather well put.

620
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,760
But even in this is an insult to you.

621
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,180
Just think

622
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,500
Why the daughter is concealing her heart's secrets from her mother.

623
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,490
There seems to be a communication gap.

624
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,550
I mean,

625
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,840
She fears

626
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,920
That you'd tell me whatever she told you.

627
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,980
Who else could I tell?

628
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,120
Why do you even need to tell anyone?

629
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,990
Listen to her, and tell me your decision.

630
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,844
Just what to do.

631
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,112
So would you do

632
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:56,566
As I say?

633
00:31:56,566 --> 00:31:59,500
Of course, I will.

634
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,660
But think over your decision carefully before telling me.

635
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,940
May I compliment you?

636
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,481
Why, right now.

637
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,920
You're the watermelon that's red on the inside.
-Hey!

638
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,150
Thank you.

639
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,640
Thank you very much.

640
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,500
So you're sleeping in my room today?

641
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,783
No?

642
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:43,760
You aren't afraid, are you?

643
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,804
Not at all?

644
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm in no mood to talk.

645
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,855
I'm very sleepy.

646
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:54,340
You'd have to listen to one thing.

647
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,842
Done.

648
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:57,993
You'd have to reply, too.

649
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:59,820
I'm always ready with my reply.

650
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,611
Just ask.

651
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:02,800
Tell me,

652
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,925
What do I have to do to show you

653
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,349
That would make you believe that I don't love Afzal?

654
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,024
What are your options?

655
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:12,327
You'd give me the options, right?

656
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:14,395
Even if you ask me to die,

657
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,662
I'd rather die.

658
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:16,732
Hey!

659
00:33:16,732 --> 00:33:18,235
So you hate him so much!

660
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,010
I don't hate him.

661
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,390
But I don't love him.

662
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,880
You still don't believe it?

663
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,340
Pray tell,

664
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,862
Don't you have options either?

665
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,550
I do have an option.

666
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,050
It'd shock you if you heard it.

667
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,030
It's even possible that you may kill me, standing right here.

668
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,610
I promise you,

669
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,569
I'd do whatever you ask me to.

670
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:50,340
Put killing aside; I wouldn't even touch you.

671
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,809
May I say it?

672
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:52,430
Yes.

673
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,649
Say it.

674
00:33:53,649 --> 00:33:56,141
It may kill you to hear it.

675
00:33:56,141 --> 00:33:57,345
Put a sock in it!

676
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,062
My name's Farah Ibrahim.

677
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:03,625
I'm made of the same mettle as the mighty boulders.

678
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,563
Allow me, then,

679
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:10,354
I'd marry Afzal.

680
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,660
Good morning!

681
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,670
Oh!

682
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,633
Good morning.

683
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,900
I've brought bed tea for you.

684
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,700
You'd get it for free from now on.

685
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,010
Where's Babu Hamid?

686
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,844
Babu Hamid's

687
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:24,600
Gone to get

688
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,892
Some milk and tea leaves.

689
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:29,840
Isn't this

690
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,157
Too much of a formality?

691
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,833
I'd have to have the second cup now.

692
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,934
So, I thought I'd have it here.

693
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,622
It'd give you company, too.

694
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,304
Right...

695
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,274
Sit.

696
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,370
What's your wife's name?

697
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,051
Wife?

698
00:35:57,051 --> 00:36:00,265
Haven't you gotten married yet?

699
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:01,944
No.

700
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,000
I got it.

701
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,276
What do you get?

702
00:36:11,276 --> 00:36:13,147
You're having an affair.

703
00:36:13,147 --> 00:36:14,870
Innit?

704
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,865
No, I don't.

705
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:16,858
Oh, shoot!

706
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,650
You're lying to Yasmin?

707
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,380
You're hiding it from me, right?

708
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,340
I don't lie.

709
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,560
Or, I lie to those I fear.

710
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,470
So you fear someone, too!

711
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,830
Splendid.

712
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,010
Who would that be?

713
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,650
Arifa.

714
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,970
My sister...

715
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,070
Molvi Subhanallah.

716
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,450
My Dad...

717
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,750
Why didn't you name your Mam?

718
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,760
I don't lie to Mum.

719
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,223
If I'm about to lie, I quieten.

720
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,190
What've you come to Karachi for?

721
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,930
No idea.

722
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,636
But why are you asking?

723
00:36:58,636 --> 00:36:59,500
Nothing, really.

724
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,688
Just a pastime.

725
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,507
Do you know how to read palms?

726
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,250
I do.

727
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,640
I can find out one's love line quickly!

728
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,674
Show me your hand.

729
00:37:17,674 --> 00:37:19,128
No --

730
00:37:19,128 --> 00:37:22,620
I don't believe in these things.

731
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,900
Dad starts saying 'No power but God's' if he sees it.

732
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,269
Such childish talk!

733
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:28,988
Is Dad around, watching?

734
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:29,855
The thing is,

735
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:31,631
I don't like it either.

736
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:38,050
Is it that you don't like it, or do you feel that you'd get caught if you showed me your hand?

737
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,460
There's a line of love on my palm.

738
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,980
It's very long.

739
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,160
But I don't know where it leads.

740
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,640
Just show me the line.

741
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,723
I'll show it the way.

742
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,914
Good joke.

743
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,010
Nice tea.

744
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,719
Thank you.

745
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,374
Mam has her fanciful suspicions about you.

746
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:09,699
Oh?

747
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,731
What kind of suspicions?

748
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:14,041
She thinks you're married,

749
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,500
Or you've got a girl after you.

750
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,410
But it isn't quite possible, really...

751
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,856
You're educated,

752
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:21,715
You look lush, too.

753
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:25,180
Surely, a couple of lasses would be ready to die for you.

754
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,620
Someone's called me 'educated' for the first time!

755
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,370
You look like a hoodlum,

756
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,580
That's why everyone must think you're not.

757
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,816
But you just said I look lush?

758
00:38:34,816 --> 00:38:35,819
It is, yes,

759
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:39,120
But it's one like a hoodlum's.

760
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,410
When you beat Wali, I thought you're an ace at it.

761
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:49,736
I beat Wali for you, and you're calling me a hoodlum?

762
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:52,610
Why did you beat him for me?

763
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,023
Who am I to you?

764
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:08,470
Say it straight, 'Yasmin, I'd lost my heart to you',

765
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,460
'So, I didn't like it that a hoodlum like Wali should boss over you'.

766
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,760
You're a Molvi's son,

767
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,562
At least be honest.

768
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,097
Well, now, it's better if you don't be honest.

769
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:26,600
A tenant falling in love with the landlord's daughter is a classic.

770
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't even believe in such things.

771
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
