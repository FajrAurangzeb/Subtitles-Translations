1
00:00:07,813 --> 00:00:13,635
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:18,856
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:23,996
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:30,172
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:35,902
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:40,563
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:09,197
Whatever happens to you every now and then?

8
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,726
Blowing hot and cold like that!

9
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:12,986
Mind your temperature, would you?

10
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:17,359
I can't look Dad in the eyes...

11
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:20,927
I feel as if I've committed a grave mistake.

12
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:24,997
Instead of making a right bags of it, I should've taken Mum into confidence

13
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:27,217
And told her I'll not marry Mehtab.

14
00:02:27,217 --> 00:02:28,787
I'll not marry anyone!

15
00:02:28,787 --> 00:02:31,067
I will go to London and pursue my MPhil.

16
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,506
What could be done now?

17
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:33,776
Why not?

18
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:37,027
Dad could be saved from this sorrow called Afzal by telling the truth!

19
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:39,667
Dad won't trust you for the rest of your life!

20
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:41,397
He'll think you lie openly,

21
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,927
And I back you up with false statements!

22
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:45,227
What's my fault?

23
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:48,370
Why are you besmirching my image?
-You're concerned about your image?

24
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,860
And it's killing me to see Dad's woe!

25
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,509
Woe will engulf him anyhow

26
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,069
Whether you decline Mehtab,

27
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,539
Or stay adamant about Afzal.

28
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:01,009
I've heard Dad had made yours and Mehtab's match in your childhood.

29
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:03,050
Thank God his Dad's no more,

30
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,739
Or he'd be at our doorstep, creating a ruckus,

31
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:07,619
Telling everyone

32
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,949
'Ibrahim is not true to his words'!

33
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:25,756
Idea!

34
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,869
Have you ever slipped in a swamp?

35
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,510
Yes, once...

36
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,879
Don't you remember --
-I do.

37
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,104
Don't remind me.

38
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:39,430
Just remember that those who trip don't get ideas.

39
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,750
Then

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,790
Should I remain firm?

41
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,310
You'll have to.

42
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,999
Don't try to disgrace me in Dad's eyes!

43
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,583
Call Afzal.

44
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,234
What do I say to him?

45
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:52,235
What should you say?

46
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,454
Fix a meeting for tomorrow!

47
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,794
So why don't you call him?

48
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,475
Ask him to meet come before the news bulletin.

49
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:00,905
If you'll meet him before the news bulletin, when will he meet Dad?

50
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,465
Why would I meet him?

51
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:04,008
You'll have to.

52
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,805
Sit with him and explain what he has to wear tomorrow

53
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,725
How he will comport himself, behave, and talk,

54
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:11,275
And how, when Dad stares at him,

55
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:13,225
He will look back!

56
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:14,705
How will he look back?

57
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:15,675
As if --

58
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,250
He's cadging!

59
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:18,475
Cadging?

60
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,986
Cadging, as in...

61
00:04:19,986 --> 00:04:22,345
Obsecrating, pleading.

62
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,415
Right, so...

63
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:26,326
How about you meet him?

64
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:29,146
Tell him everything one by one!

65
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,065
For God's sake, Farah,

66
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:33,685
Talk to him for once.

67
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:34,925
He, too, should know

68
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,235
That the one he 'loves'

69
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,435
Is easily accessible.

70
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,325
Accessible?

71
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:44,625
Or else he'll start stammering before Dad at the mention of your name!

72
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,216
Alright.

73
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,680
I'll tell you everything now.

74
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,528
He loves someone else.

75
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,631
She, too, writes to him twice a week.

76
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,678
It's an old love story.

77
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:06,628
So?

78
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:08,427
Try to understand, Farah.

79
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:14,180
To get such a connatural lover to feign love for another girl is not easy.

80
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,368
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

81
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,627
What was there to mention?

82
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,017
Besides, for the amount you're offering,

83
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:26,838
Any indigent artist would agree to give his best performance!

84
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:29,008
He's my friend's brother,

85
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,567
And he's got no job these days,

86
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,317
I thought he'd earn something this way.

87
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,346
Where do I meet him?

88
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,736
At the same restaurant.

89
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:41,896
You'll see.

90
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,946
He'll die of greed.

91
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:46,007
If his girlfriend found out

92
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,507
You'll see what she does to him!

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,100
Call him.

94
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,441
Wait.

95
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,270
I'll get my phone.

96
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,310
He'll be coming to meet me tomorrow.

97
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,707
I'll say it flatly,

98
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:20,719
'Take your one million',

99
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,647
'And spare our lives'!

100
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,308
Don't say such a thing.

101
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,477
Why?

102
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,627
As if I have anything to fear from him!

103
00:06:27,627 --> 00:06:29,177
I fear him.

104
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,317
He's not that type.

105
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,927
I don't know what you've seen in him.

106
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,127
It was just yesterday when he used to gamble on matches!

107
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,147
He'd win some and lose some.

108
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,707
But he's certain to win here.

109
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,301
Say yes,

110
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,427
Take his one million,

111
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,757
And make himself scarce.

112
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,595
Alright, satisfy yourself.

113
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,345
But please,

114
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,114
Stay quiet if he says anything back.

115
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:53,424
Don't let him go.

116
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:55,944
Should I have him stay if he turns rude?

117
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,014
He won't turn rude.

118
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:01,214
Just ask him not to leave before meeting me.

119
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,963
Hello?

120
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:34,153
This is Farah speaking.

121
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,483
Hello?

122
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:42,534
You listening?

123
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,820
He's not even listening!

124
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,025
I'm listening.

125
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,494
Say it clearly that you are!

126
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,480
Yes?

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,823
We'll meet tomorrow at the same restaurant

128
00:07:59,823 --> 00:08:02,010
At 1 in the afternoon.

129
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,459
You're meeting Dad tomorrow

130
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:05,885
No --

131
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,385
You'll meet Mum first.

132
00:08:08,602 --> 00:08:10,412
We'll go to the boutique from there,

133
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,582
And purchase a fine suit for you.

134
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,754
And listen to this carefully,

135
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:18,497
Mum is even more inflamed at the sound of your name than Dad!

136
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:20,952
Come with your parts thoroughly rehearsed.

137
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:23,373
You'll be heading for our place from there.

138
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:24,902
Okay?

139
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:29,800
At least say okay!

140
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,679
He's not saying it...

141
00:08:39,776 --> 00:08:40,950
Are you there?

142
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,726
Lubna speaking.

143
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,556
I recognised your voice.

144
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,636
Do you understand it?

145
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,506
Understand what?

146
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,537
Farah just told you about the meeting tomorrow.

147
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,096
I heard it.

148
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:57,050
When will you come?

149
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,147
Where?

150
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,626
To the restaurant, of course!

151
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,618
Tell me, when should I come?

152
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,117
At one.

153
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:06,960
In the afternoon.

154
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,907
Obviously,

155
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,507
She won't meet me at 1.00 a.m.

156
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,147
Don't worry.

157
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:14,464
I'll be there.

158
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,524
Do you remember that you're meeting Mum tomorrow?

159
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,074
I'll meet anyone after her.

160
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,234
No problem.

161
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,314
Alright. I'll disconnect.

162
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,954
Listen.

163
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,124
Pray tell!

164
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:29,125
The thing is --

165
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:32,254
Farah had called me before you did.

166
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:35,925
Said 'Hello', told me her name, and disconnected the call.

167
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,514
Oh God...

168
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,569
Why are you saying 'Oh God'?

169
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:42,739
Just...

170
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:44,409
'By the way'.

171
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,459
Will she be coming tomorrow too?

172
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,660
She'll be coming; I'll just accompany her.

173
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,490
I'll pay for dinner then.

174
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,880
Why?

175
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,870
Just 'by the way'.

176
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,827
What happened?

177
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:06,486
Mum will devour him like a bonne bouche!

178
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,906
Oh God...

179
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,100
Yes...

180
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,889
Yes,

181
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:53,554
I'd told you earlier!

182
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,167
Dad,

183
00:11:00,474 --> 00:11:02,299
May you live long.

184
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,513
Why hasn't he

185
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,873
Taken his lunch box today?

186
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,197
He has a working lunch today at his office.

187
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,947
Oh.

188
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:22,287
You still suspect him?

189
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:27,629
A father's questions are not a mark of suspicion, my dear.

190
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:30,669
They are a mark of care and prudence.

191
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,359
Who brought this English newspaper?

192
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,909
He's brought it.

193
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,149
He's been reading it for two days!

194
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,079
Oh...

195
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,969
Somebody must've thrown him a jibe over his English...

196
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,440
Listen,

197
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,180
Ruqaiyya!

198
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,961
I'll be attending a congregation,

199
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,080
And heading to the Mosque on the way back.

200
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,460
Alright.

201
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,671
Alright, my dear. Goodbye.

202
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:02,470
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

203
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,801
It was Molvi Sahab,

204
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,471
He's attending a congregation.

205
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:10,991
No, he has not the slightest interest in politics.

206
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:13,460
His 'congregations' are not congregations, really.

207
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,461
It's a congregation for him wherever

208
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:21,131
A handful of pious people gather to listen to his sermons.

209
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:40,536
Sir,

210
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:42,646
Would you like to have some tea?

211
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,255
Yes, please.

212
00:12:44,255 --> 00:12:45,197
Okay, sir.

213
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,963
Listen!
-Yes, sir?

214
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:48,723
I hope you remember.

215
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,143
What, sir?

216
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,613
Come here.

217
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,696
I'll pay the bill.

218
00:12:53,696 --> 00:12:55,443
I do remember, sir.

219
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:56,603
Alright.

220
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:58,043
Okay, sir.

221
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,636
Why are you laughing?

222
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:54,364
I thought I'd put on this cream because I don't have any aftershave.

223
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:55,415
And

224
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,114
It isn't yours.

225
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:59,745
Where'd you get this cream?

226
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:01,005
I purchased it.

227
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,505
When? You didn't step out of the house.

228
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,915
I bought it on my way back

229
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:06,976
From the office yesterday.

230
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,569
You wouldn't have seen it.

231
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,416
You're brilliant.

232
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,916
When you could go and purchase it,

233
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,616
Why didn't you get some aftershave?

234
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,956
It costs 450!

235
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,466
And this one costs 120.

236
00:14:18,706 --> 00:14:20,497
Does this satisfy you?

237
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,610
Where is he?

238
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,469
Right over there.

239
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,439
Hi!

240
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:07,593
Hi!

241
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,075
Please, sit.

242
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:18,435
Yes.

243
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:25,074
How long have you been here?

244
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,884
Since 9.30.

245
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,694
9.30?

246
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,664
But we asked you to come at 1.00?

247
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:35,381
I leave for my office at 9.

248
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:38,861
I've not told my family that I've left the job.

249
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,391
What would you like to have?

250
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:48,081
You're feeling hungry?

251
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:49,981
No.

252
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,441
That's great.

253
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,622
My very life is at risk here,

254
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,231
And you're asking me what I'll have?

255
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,311
I've not had a cup of tea since the morning!

256
00:15:56,311 --> 00:15:57,671
Now, I'll only have something

257
00:15:57,671 --> 00:15:59,981
When you've won this round.

258
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,783
Round?

259
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,110
This thing about the round is a new one.

260
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,731
You didn't mention this.

261
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,441
You're meeting Mum at 5.

262
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:12,940
I remember that.

263
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:15,081
That's a round, so to speak.

264
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,280
Oh...

265
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,422
She'll be talking rough and coarse.

266
00:16:18,422 --> 00:16:22,110
But you'll reply to her jovially and listen quietly.

267
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,172
You understand 'jovially', don't you?

268
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,950
I do.

269
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,109
But

270
00:16:28,109 --> 00:16:30,642
It'd be better if you explain.

271
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:33,396
Even if she uses an expletive, keep smiling.

272
00:16:33,396 --> 00:16:34,895
She'd use expletives?

273
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:36,890
No. She won't.

274
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,558
But she'll definitely say something

275
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,427
That'll be as acerbic.

276
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:42,775
Don't worry.

277
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:45,326
I'll listen to it jovially!

278
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,547
What would you like to have, sir?

279
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:49,836
What would I have --?

280
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:52,677
I mean, what would you like to eat?

281
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,660
You --

282
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,930
You're bothered about food, old chap?

283
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,386
Okay, sir...

284
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,320
What else do I tell him?

285
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:07,497
Right.

286
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:08,567
When you stand before Mum,

287
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,457
Don't stand there like a servant.

288
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:15,987
Here.

289
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:16,998
Like this.

290
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:19,927
Stand with both your hands at the back.

291
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:23,046
Sure, I'll do exactly like that.

292
00:17:23,046 --> 00:17:28,046
And be sure to get your hands out of the way when you sit.
-But obviously, I will.

293
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,986
Get to the point quick when you talk,

294
00:17:29,986 --> 00:17:31,633
Even if you utter a lie,

295
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,556
Stick to it.

296
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:35,166
You can think I've stuck to it.

297
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,436
And if something enrages you, make sure it can be seen on your face.

298
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,746
I will.

299
00:17:40,746 --> 00:17:42,166
Exempli gratia,

300
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,294
If she talks about your status,

301
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,546
If she asks you,

302
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,466
'Look at your status'!

303
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,966
'How dare you love Farah'?

304
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:52,053
Then?

305
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,257
What would be your reaction?

306
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,063
Don't worry.

307
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,490
A 'Don't worry' won't do.

308
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,200
Act it out.

309
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,888
I'll tell you.

310
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:07,150
Put the tea cup back on the table,

311
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,820
And sit irefully.

312
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,532
I was thinking of the same.

313
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:11,539
But --

314
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,500
Under these conditions -- Would she offer me tea?

315
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,909
We even offer tea to our enemies!

316
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:20,251
Leave the rest to me.

317
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,781
I'd have had my breakfast if I could leave the rest to you!

318
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,461
Please, have some tea.

319
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,341
God willing, I'll win this round.

320
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:29,841
Waiter!

321
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:32,431
I'd like half a set of tea --

322
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,580
Three separate teas.

323
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,120
Yes, I'd like to ask for Ibrahim Cottons' contact number.

324
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,988
Alright, thank you.

325
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,840
Hello?

326
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,430
Peace be upon you. Am I through to Ibrahim Cottons?

327
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,134
Get me through to Accounts.

328
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:04,198
And yes,

329
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:05,466
One more thing.

330
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:06,496
If she asks,

331
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,216
'Has Farah been writing you letters'?

332
00:20:08,216 --> 00:20:09,796
Say it strongly,

333
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,726
'Yes, she has been'.

334
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,176
She may even say,

335
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,046
'Alright',

336
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,176
'Show me her letters'.

337
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
I will show her.

338
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,320
I will show her all of them.

339
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,230
All of them?

340
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,201
I mean, I'll ask her as many as she wants to see.

341
00:20:24,201 --> 00:20:26,201
For God's sake, my good man!

342
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,900
You never show your sweetheart's letters to her parents!

343
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,581
Oh...

344
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,682
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:36,331
So, what would you say then?

346
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:43,266
I'll say, 'These heartfelt words are treasures in the possession of largehearted lovers;'

347
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:47,346
'It is not comme il faut to reave this treasure'.

348
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,409
Wow...

349
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,769
Now you're suckin' diesel!

350
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:56,489
Was it good?

351
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,389
What are you talking about?

352
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:00,799
This answer will gag Mum.

353
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,339
She won't ever mention the letters again.

354
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:05,732
Which cell phone do you have?

355
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:08,362
No --

356
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:10,110
I keep it in my pocket.

357
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:12,001
Are you nuts?

358
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,279
You'd wear a suit,

359
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,901
And keep your cell phone in your trouser pocket?

360
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,198
It's --

361
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:19,539
Not the type to keep it out in the open.

362
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,369
It's dirt cheap.

363
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:25,321
It's ringing.

364
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,983
Excuse me.

365
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,423
Arifa's calling me.

366
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,191
She --

367
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,661
Calls me around break time to ask if I've had something to eat.

368
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:40,216
Yes, Arifa?

369
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,456
Where are you?

370
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,738
At my office. Where else would I be?
-You're lying, aren't you?

371
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,169
Lying?

372
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,826
No -- You must --

373
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,896
Have a feeling I'm not at the office today.

374
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,312
I'd told you I have a working lunch at the office today.

375
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,539
So --

376
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,259
I'm at this restaurant right now.

377
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,569
With my colleagues.

378
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,106
Alright.

379
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:09,030
When will you be back?

380
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,369
The usual.

381
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,649
No --

382
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:13,541
I'll be late.

383
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:16,349
I have a meeting with the boss.

384
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:18,686
A rather long one at that!

385
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,850
Alright,

386
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,710
I'll disconnect...

387
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,749
I'm a bit busy.

388
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:38,776
Thank you.

389
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:46,066
I don't know what's the matter...

390
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:49,256
I'm not afraid at all lying to Dad,

391
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:52,809
But it scares me to lie to Arifa.

392
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,739
If you think

393
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,869
I'm lying under my oath by you,

394
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:30,276
Then I'm not wicked,

395
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,736
I'm the most vile and dastardly.

396
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:34,186
I said call him here.

397
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:38,016
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

398
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,076
Strange.

399
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,916
He's fearing me

400
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,733
And I him...

401
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:17,061
It'll be raining soon...

402
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,566
It will, sure.

403
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:20,756
Mehtab's wails rumble the skies,

404
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:23,113
And his late father's curses thunder down...

405
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:23,966
Shut up!

406
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,876
Knock the door to the trial room.

407
00:24:25,876 --> 00:24:28,016
It's been 20 minutes.

408
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,300
He must've started admiring his self in a suit!

409
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,600
So be it!

410
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,640
I wonder how he'd look after 5.

411
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:16,216
That's fine!

412
00:25:16,277 --> 00:25:17,746
Keep it on.

413
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,548
I'm paying the bill and leaving.

414
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:22,467
Come at 5 o'clock sharp!

415
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,710
Come.

416
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,520
Give it to me.

417
00:25:49,623 --> 00:25:51,570
When will he come here?

418
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,251
Five o'clock.

419
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:55,668
Five, as in...?

420
00:25:55,668 --> 00:25:57,380
Five o'clock sharp!

421
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,110
Did you tell him whom he'll be meeting first?

422
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,189
Yes, I did.

423
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,670
Alright, go.

424
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,699
And yes,

425
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:08,450
Remember

426
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,268
Neither of you will be coming downstairs

427
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,950
Until the meeting's over.

428
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:21,708
Hajira!

429
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:23,424
Hajira!

430
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,050
Yes, Madame?

431
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:37,257
Get some snacks to serve with the tea.

432
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,807
Alright.

433
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,520
Peace be upon you, Dad.
-And upon you, peace.

434
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,089
By the Lord!

435
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,119
We used to crave for rains,

436
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,969
And now it rains twice a week!

437
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:52,859
God is the Greatest indeed!

438
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:56,416
God forgive...

439
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,073
Where's your mother?

440
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:07,252
She's

441
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:09,474
Getting the clothes from the terrace.

442
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,257
Oh.

443
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:14,453
Here.

444
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:17,529
This is completely drenched.

445
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,339
Get me some tea

446
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,920
And I'll forgive every one of Ruqaiyya's inanities!

447
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,250
Sure.

448
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,216
Dad,

449
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:36,476
Does Lubna's father come for his morning prayers?

450
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:38,427
Not at all!

451
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:41,896
Ever since he [Afzal]'s started working,

452
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:45,696
He [Ibrahim]'s not set foot in the Mosque.

453
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,956
But why are you asking this?

454
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,987
Did you talk to Lubna?

455
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,637
He's alright, isn't he?

456
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,447
That's why I was asking you.

457
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:59,996
I'll ask Lubna how he is when I call her.

458
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,410
Alright.

459
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,499
Come downstairs; I'm back!

460
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:10,460
I hope the silly lady doesn't get all drenched!

461
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,420
Yes, sir?

462
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,319
Tell me

463
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:26,140
I wouldn't get wet in the rickshaw, would I?

464
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,744
No, sir, you won't if you sit at the centre.

465
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,600
Come!

466
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:39,569
Where do you want to go?

467
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,353
Mohalla Naqshbandi.

468
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,830
Alright.

469
00:28:58,756 --> 00:29:00,646
You're worried, aren't you?

470
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,926
I'm waiting for five o'clock.

471
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:06,826
I'm very worried, Farah.

472
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:08,196
Don't worry.

473
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:10,536
He'll stand firm in this round.

474
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,359
You've begun to trust him already?

475
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,071
Only after I've met him today.

476
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:20,810
He was bungling every now and then,

477
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:23,400
But one line struck me.

478
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,119
When he said,

479
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:29,359
'These heartfelt words are treasures in the possession of largehearted lovers'.

480
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,389
I was awed to hear that.

481
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:35,288
That a tongue-tied imbecile would say such big words...

482
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:37,959
I'd never thought of this.

483
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:47,866
Alright, stop here.

484
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:50,223
What's the fare?

485
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,432
300 Rupees, sir.

486
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:54,783
300 Rupees?

487
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:55,932
Isn't it a bit too much?
-Sir,

488
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,983
It doesn't suit someone wearing such a suit

489
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:01,833
To say something like this.

490
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,463
Alright.

491
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:09,610
Here.

492
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,550
Go now.

493
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,070
He's here!

494
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:31,391
Wait.

495
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:34,483
Where are you going?

496
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,091
Someone's outside.

497
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,652
Mademoiselle Lubna had told me

498
00:30:37,652 --> 00:30:40,124
That someone was expected at five.

499
00:30:40,124 --> 00:30:41,871
Alright, then,

500
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:44,891
Just ask his name; don't let him inside at first.

501
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,891
Alright.
-Go.

502
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:01,849
It's me, Afzal.

503
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,170
Wait.

504
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,650
It's Afzal, Madame.

505
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,470
Molvi Sahab's son, you know.

506
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:26,959
Alright.

507
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,335
He isn't getting drenched?

508
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:30,349
He's half-drenched already!

509
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,350
Look at the ferocity of this downpour...

510
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,880
God forgive...

511
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:39,057
Where's the driver?

512
00:31:39,306 --> 00:31:40,701
In his quarters.

513
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:42,336
Shall I get him?

514
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,741
No.

515
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,004
Then?

516
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,419
What are you looking at? Go.

517
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,832
Get him inside and have him sit in the drawing room.

518
00:31:53,832 --> 00:31:54,933
Go.

519
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,748
What is it?

520
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:44,951
Molvi Sahab's son has come.

521
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:47,149
Why are you dying of a shocker if he's here?

522
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:50,718
I've just come to tell you that he's not in a good condition.

523
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,279
I know.

524
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,151
But don't think about others

525
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,728
For you're not in a good condition either.

526
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,748
You're not quite getting it...

527
00:32:58,748 --> 00:33:00,748
Explain quickly, then.

528
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:03,796
Look at the downpour outside!

529
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,892
You'd come to explain this?

530
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:08,202
He's all drenched!

531
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,009
And if I'd opened the door on time,

532
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:15,559
He wouldn't be all soaked in water like this.

533
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,389
Why didn't you open the door on time?

534
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:20,265
Your mother had stopped me.

535
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,929
What?

536
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:24,462
Stopped me in my tracks

537
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:27,430
Started talking about the rains and the thunder...

538
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,729
Then?

539
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,490
The rain went on pouring,

540
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,720
And he kept on getting drenched in it.

541
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,377
And when she ordered me to call him inside,

542
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:38,187
He was drenched from head to toe.

543
00:33:38,187 --> 00:33:42,377
His boots would splash water around as he walked.

544
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:16,016
Please, sit.

545
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,591
Do you need a towel?

546
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,131
No.

547
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,522
Do you feel cold?

548
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,349
I do.

549
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,520
But I won't have tea.

550
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,196
I'd come to meet Farah's mother.

551
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:36,786
She'd wanted to meet at 5, but it's half past 5 already.

552
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,506
She's coming.

553
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,506
Thank you.

554
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,750
Please, come inside.

555
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,086
Mum!

556
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:18,136
I'd told you that neither of you will be coming downstairs before the meeting's over.

557
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,186
But why isn't the meeting starting, Mum?

558
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,756
It's almost 6!

559
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,986
He's come all drenched in the rain,

560
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:25,942
I thought he'd settle down a bit

561
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:27,789
Have some tea and all.

562
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,411
He's settled down.

563
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:31,646
Please, go on with the meeting.

564
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:33,657
Go upstairs. Both of you!

565
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:36,956
Go!

566
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,178
Whom are you serving this?

567
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:53,628
You.

568
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:54,668
Please don't.

569
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:56,922
I don't want to have tea.

570
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:03,530
Sit.

571
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,400
You may leave.

572
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,950
Peace be upon you.

573
00:36:09,078 --> 00:36:10,966
And upon you, peace.

574
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:13,706
I figure it took a while for the gate to be opened

575
00:36:13,706 --> 00:36:15,766
And you got drenched.

576
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,286
Yes.

577
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,940
It's quite the downpour, really...

578
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,470
And would you look at the lightning!

579
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,598
All of Thor's fury...

580
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes.

581
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,883
Our elders used to say,

582
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:31,657
'When there's lightning',

583
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,727
'You don't go out in a black suit'.

584
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:38,688
I stood at the gate for ten minutes in this lightning.

585
00:36:38,688 --> 00:36:40,537
Nothing happened to me.

586
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:42,457
You don't fear anything

587
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:45,017
Because nothing's ever happened to you.

588
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:46,286
Yes?

589
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:48,867
You haven't had your tea.

590
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:50,217
No...

591
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:52,007
I no longer need tea.

592
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:54,579
Have a cup; you're shivering.

593
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,233
No, thank you.

594
00:36:56,384 --> 00:36:58,149
I'm shivering because

595
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,650
I'm a bit afraid.

596
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,560
You're afraid of me?

597
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:05,317
I fear those whom I immensely respect.

598
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:07,847
I fear my Dad, too.

599
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,897
Where did you work?

600
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:13,641
I was a clerk at your factory.

601
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:16,052
I left the job after two days.

602
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:17,907
I know.

603
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:19,982
I also know why.

604
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,070
What are you doing these days?

605
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,940
I've started working on a new project

606
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,930
That earns me 200,000.

607
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,090
I'll work for four months on it.

608
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,009
Why only four months?

609
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:35,710
Besides, who's foolish enough to offer a third division BA like you

610
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,600
A job that would earn 200,000?

611
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,540
Dad says,

612
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,886
'Always seek association with the enlightened'.

613
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,899
'And if you have to look for someone enlightened',

614
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:50,649
'It means the world has far more who are ignorant'.

615
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,690
And as for these four months,

616
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,319
It is unfortunate that the project will only take four months.

617
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,709
It'll end in December.

618
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,399
How much do you love her?

619
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:05,323
That's a good question.

620
00:38:06,143 --> 00:38:09,613
Please, then, answer it if it's indeed a good question.

621
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,070
How much do you love her?

622
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,679
I'm her mother.

623
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,119
Who doesn't know the love of a mother?

624
00:38:18,066 --> 00:38:21,249
Who does know my love!

625
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:24,197
What do you think?

626
00:38:24,197 --> 00:38:27,457
Someone like you would fall for Farah,

627
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:29,876
And we'd give away our Farah

628
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:32,417
To him like a benefaction!

629
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:34,457
Not at all.

630
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,702
What did you think, coming here?

631
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,059
I've thought of nothing.

632
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,210
Farah told me you'd called me,

633
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,740
So, I came.

634
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,697
But now that I'm here,

635
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:48,566
I'll only leave after I've talked about everything.

636
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,656
'Everything'?

637
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:55,971
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:58,999
Yes,

639
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,833
So what's 'everything'?

640
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:02,490
I wanted to say that

641
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:06,510
It is not meet, considering my status, that I love Farah,

642
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,129
But I have a right to love Farah.

643
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,709
Oh?

644
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,669
Who bestowed this right upon you?

645
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:16,179
No...

646
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,029
Nobody bestows this right,

647
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:19,730
Nor does anyone ask for it.

648
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,209
Or else, one would have to take permission before falling in love.

649
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,620
This would make a complete haymes of it all.

650
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,663
A complete haymes, as in?

651
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:30,940
As in, asking permission

652
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,290
Of the one you love first.

653
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,821
Mention your status,

654
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:36,229
And ask,

655
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:38,682
'May I love you'?

656
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:44,356
What would you take to just love her?

657
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:46,666
Another good question.

658
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:50,536
I've asked you something.

659
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,478
How much money would you take to spare her life?

660
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,868
The thing is, I've promised on oath to Dad I'd never gamble again.

661
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:04,848
I'm not talking about gambling.

662
00:40:04,848 --> 00:40:06,868
You are talking about gambling.

663
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:09,339
But it seems you do not understand gambling.

664
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:11,541
My friend, Babloo,

665
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:15,128
He says, 'Win the match, and the money's all yours'.

666
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:20,498
And you're saying, 'Lose the match, and the money's all yours'.

667
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
