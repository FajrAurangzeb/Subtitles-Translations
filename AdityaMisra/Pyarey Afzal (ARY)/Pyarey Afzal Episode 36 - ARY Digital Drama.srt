1
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:13,428
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:18,528
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:23,839
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,919
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:35,606
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:40,656
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,966
Oh God!

8
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,506
She's suddenly taken to praying!

9
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:04,009
Pray quickly and tell me what's wrong this time!

10
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:07,366
God knows what she's praying for!

11
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,526
I was praying that this Sunday not fall on the 27th.

12
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,866
Or that the 27th not be a Sunday.

13
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,646
Are you touched in the head?

14
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:20,437
I'm getting married this Sunday, you blighter!

15
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:21,626
You'll not get married.

16
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,436
I've wished for this in my prayers!

17
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,136
You're envying your own sister?

18
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,523
Do you remember

19
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:34,103
How you said that you are making this marriage possible?

20
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,333
I'd said that I made this engagement possible.

21
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:39,863
But you've taken a shortcut from the engagement to the marriage!

22
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:42,053
What can be done now?

23
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:45,273
When Farah thinks of something, her decision is final.

24
00:02:45,273 --> 00:02:47,243
You don't need to think anything.

25
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:49,713
What you thought to be an engagement was no engagement!

26
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:52,263
That was a part of your treatment!

27
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,622
What?

28
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:59,172
You mean --

29
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:03,402
That bleeding psychiatrist was treating me?

30
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:07,261
We were both of the opinion that you'd need a different kind of shock therapy.

31
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:09,104
You love someone else

32
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:11,404
And you're not ready to admit it.

33
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,842
And that blighter was saying with complete confidence,

34
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:15,482
That the moment it'd come to marrying him,

35
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:17,092
You'd shriek,

36
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:20,591
'No way, I can't marry Sibtain'!

37
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,373
So he wasn't in love?

38
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:26,419
He was conniving!

39
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:29,389
You weren't in love either.

40
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,790
You, too, were conniving!

41
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,989
You were exacting your revenge over Afzal's engagement.

42
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,419
Afzal again?

43
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:37,046
Tell me, who is he?

44
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:39,246
Whose is this Afzal?

45
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:41,456
First with that Farah who wrote him letters,

46
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,686
Then with you,

47
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,578
And then with that blighter Yasmin --

48
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,436
Well,

49
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,926
Yasmin is my friend now;

50
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:51,996
I won't call her a blighter.

51
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,846
I was never with him, Farah.

52
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:56,276
I was lying.

53
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,667
Lying?

54
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,386
I mean I was just putting up a show.

55
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:01,266
Because of this doltish Sibtain.

56
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,716
The blighter read a bunch of his books

57
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:08,156
And said, 'When Afzal's name comes next to yours, she'll say with evident agony -'

58
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:09,207
''Shut up, Lubna'!'

59
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,846
''Don't even think about Afzal'!'

60
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,457
He was right in saying that.

61
00:04:14,984 --> 00:04:17,135
Don't you remember I'd slapped you and said,

62
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,094
'Don't even think about Afzal'!

63
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:21,946
But you didn't say anything beyond that!

64
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,345
What should've I said beyond that?

65
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:26,224
The same thing you are unable to utter;

66
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,224
The same thing that unfortunate bloke couldn't muster the courage to say.

67
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:31,425
You've killed each other,

68
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:35,485
Too reluctant to accept that you love each other.

69
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:40,134
I've said it a hundred times over and will say it a thousand times more,

70
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,034
I don't love Afzal!

71
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:44,554
I don't love Afzal!

72
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:01,888
Sit down.

73
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:11,014
Here are all those letters

74
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,920
Besides the one in your possession.

75
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,284
These are not letters, Yasmin.

76
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,617
These are an unsung chronicle of love.

77
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,641
This chronicle ended when

78
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,100
I got engaged to you.

79
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,220
Take this

80
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,760
And torch these with your own hands.

81
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:44,197
Just think as if

82
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:48,067
Afzal had a dream since his childhood days;

83
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:54,017
His dream unfulfilled, he felt too ashamed to even disclose what his dream was.

84
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:57,137
Don't look at me;

85
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,967
I'll never mention who wrote these letters.

86
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,170
Will you torch these, or should I?

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,360
No one will torch them, Afzal.

88
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,550
Letters written in love are not to be burnt.

89
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,709
One kisses and lifts them to the eyes,

90
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:43,860
And holds on to them like a book of Divine Revelation that touches the heart.

91
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,239
You are under my oath, Afzal -

92
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:51,381
Burn all you want in the flames of her searing remembrance,

93
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,959
But never burn these.

94
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:23,019
Arifa, I want to meet Farah.

95
00:07:24,176 --> 00:07:25,207
Right now?

96
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:26,776
Right now.

97
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:28,696
Have you asked him?

98
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:30,916
I won't ask him.

99
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,429
I'll tell him when I'm back.

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,554
Does she retire by 11?

101
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,209
I don't know.

102
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,210
Then call her

103
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,209
Tell her

104
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,620
That it's important that I meet her.

105
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,859
Tell me

106
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:50,079
What will you say to her when you meet her?

107
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:51,749
Nothing, really.

108
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,949
I've got a few questions in my heart.

109
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,169
It'll satisfy me when I've asked her.

110
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,949
I'll talk to Lubna.

111
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,010
Hello, Arifa!

112
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,589
How are you?

113
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,641
I don't know.

114
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:24,619
Hey?

115
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:25,529
What happened?

116
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,479
To be honest, I'm furious!

117
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,949
I feel like murdering that chuffing Farah!

118
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,091
She's getting married this Sunday.

119
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,920
Why do you need to murder her now?

120
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,020
She hasn't rejected the marriage, has she?

121
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,222
No.

122
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,114
She's not rejecting it this time!

123
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:47,970
She's firm on Sunday.

124
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,140
Alright; by the way

125
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,519
Yasmin wants to meet her.

126
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,132
Everything alright?

127
00:08:56,132 --> 00:08:57,740
I don't know.

128
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,449
She said that she wants to meet right now.

129
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,330
Tell her to come over.

130
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,570
But how will she come?

131
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,799
Tell her to get ready.

132
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,880
I'll send a car.

133
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,219
Thank you.

134
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,140
Shut up, mate.

135
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,769
The car will be there in ten minutes.

136
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,769
Okay.
-Bye.

137
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:52,931
Would you look at that, Ruqaiyya Begum?

138
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:56,901
He's massaging my feet to sweeten me up!

139
00:09:56,901 --> 00:10:01,501
I'm also looking at how you're not sweetening up!

140
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,471
You could say

141
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:11,253
That there's not that old warmth now...

142
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:17,269
There's this knot in my heart now.

143
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:20,819
Keep on massaging.

144
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,691
It'll untie this knot.

145
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:31,209
Do you remember, when I'd had the heart attack, you'd said,

146
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,397
'The Molvi has been overcome by the father'?

147
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,186
You were right.

148
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:44,906
You were right.

149
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,019
If a Molvi is more fatherly,

150
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,029
He may succumb to a weakness of honour.

151
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:01,656
I mean, it's not as if I've been dishonoured,

152
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:05,286
But, still,

153
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:09,396
I am in no position to avouch.

154
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,050
Why are you laughing?

155
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,620
I'm feeling sleepy,

156
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,479
And

157
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:25,169
It's without having to take any sleeping pills!

158
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:34,333
Is everything alright?

159
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,054
Nothing's alright.

160
00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:39,164
It's something or the other since the day I've come here.

161
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,604
Where is she?

162
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,281
She's sleeping.

163
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,991
You'll see. She'll wake up today.

164
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,261
Upstairs?

165
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,561
Yes.

166
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,255
Stay here.

167
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:53,993
Just tell me where her room is.

168
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,540
Hers is the first room on the left when you climb upstairs and turn right.

169
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:45,400
Open your eyes!

170
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,547
I'm actually by your side!

171
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,759
I don't believe this.

172
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,246
Is everything alright?

173
00:12:57,246 --> 00:13:00,340
Wake up and we'll talk.

174
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,761
I'm awake.

175
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:05,370
What is it?

176
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,760
I've got a few questions, Farah.

177
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,980
Will you answer them?

178
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,419
Ask away.

179
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,049
Do you know Miss Mary?

180
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,219
Miss Marry, who?

181
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:19,359
No, I don't know her.

182
00:13:19,359 --> 00:13:20,979
The year was 2007.

183
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:23,310
Where were you studying back then?

184
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,230
I was doing my O-Levels back then...

185
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,311
Oh, yes -- Just a minute.

186
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:33,933
Miss Mary D'Souza was a teacher at my school.

187
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:36,173
She was so stern!

188
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:40,073
She used to get angry a lot; perhaps it's because she was a divorcee...

189
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:42,963
How did you find out about her?

190
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,883
I don't think even Lubna remembers her name.

191
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:49,612
You'd written it in a letter to him.

192
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:51,623
You'd warned him,

193
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:56,421
'If you stood in wait in front of the school or looked at me here or there, I'll have you caught'.

194
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,253
To whom did I write this?

195
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,175
Afzal.

196
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:06,247
I've got the letter in my bag if you want to read it.

197
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:08,040
I don't need to read it.

198
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,310
I know that a girl writes him letters.

199
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,771
Her name is Farah.

200
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:15,221
And I'm getting a bad name because of her.

201
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:17,451
There's just one way now, Yasmin.

202
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,171
Grab Afzal by the collar and ask him,

203
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:20,132
'Tell me'

204
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:21,401
'Who is this Farah'?

205
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:24,292
Why shouldn't one ask you before asking Afzal?

206
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:28,702
Why is the name of that Farah's teacher Mary D'Souza?

207
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,329
Perhaps this is why you're marrying a psychiatrist.

208
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,609
You know, deep inside, that you're ailing.

209
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,760
If he's not willing to tell me,

210
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,750
You're not willing to admit it either.

211
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,379
You wrote these letter, Farah.

212
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,000
It's possible

213
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,250
That you fell in love with him sometime

214
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,628
And afflicted with that love, you wrote those letters.

215
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,529
But you realised later on

216
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,933
That he's not your class!

217
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,010
This is why you hide your face in shame,

218
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,147
Lie to everyone,

219
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:05,503
And tell everyone that the Farah who wrote him letters is someone else.

220
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,583
You're getting married this Sunday, aren't you?

221
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,839
That's it.

222
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,280
It's just a problem until your marriage.

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,359
You'll be cured,

224
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,980
As will he be.

225
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:24,120
He holds on to your letters even now.

226
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,776
He's forgotten everything else he should've held on to.

227
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,927
Wake up, Farah.

228
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,458
Don't ever sleep in peace

229
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:37,227
With the knowledge that you've given many others sleepless nights.

230
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,840
Ask the driver to leave me home.

231
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,130
Come.

232
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:18,977
I've given her such a slosh she'll be left wondering.

233
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:21,557
What'll she be left wondering?

234
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:22,807
Just

235
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,507
What this Yasmin is made of!

236
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:26,809
Tell me,

237
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:28,359
What are you made of?

238
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:30,388
I've said it clearly to her,

239
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:32,210
'You used to write letters to Afzal'.

240
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,998
Why did you say that?

241
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:35,626
This Miss Mary D'Souza

242
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,069
Was a teacher at her school.

243
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:38,265
Tell me, then,

244
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,115
If it's her teacher who's mentioned,

245
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,629
She's the one who wrote those letters, isn't she?

246
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,787
She's not admitted it yet.

247
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,855
But now, she's within my grasp.

248
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:52,478
I couldn't dare imagine!

249
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,898
For the love of God,

250
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:58,419
How much my brother has been humiliated because of those letters!

251
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,436
I'm here now,

252
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,026
And I'll leave only after I've extracted the truth from her.

253
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,109
Didn't Mum ask you where you had gone?

254
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,630
She didn't ask but she was staring at me quietly.

255
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,600
What's this?

256
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,209
Afzal's diary.

257
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:24,197
He used to write it everyday up to his FA [A-Level] days.

258
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:27,567
There's another one from after he'd completed his FA [A-Levels].

259
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,718
I've read both of them

260
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,607
But found no clue.

261
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:33,237
May I read this?

262
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,587
Let me see what he used to write.

263
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,108
Go on.

264
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,850
'If love were a cricket match, I would've won'.

265
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,711
'I gambled for the first time today'.

266
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,800
'Won 500 Rupees'.

267
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,461
'I gave them all to Arifa',

268
00:17:55,461 --> 00:18:00,441
'And Arifa is the kind who gave me a right scolding, asking where I'd got them from'.

269
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,540
'What could I do'?

270
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,691
'I lied to her, seeing her anger'.

271
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,754
What's the matter?

272
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:37,835
Just a second.

273
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,860
What is it in that letter?

274
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,139
She's got wind of who wrote those letters.

275
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,550
And the clue lies in the very letter she's got in her bag.

276
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,510
Why is she doing this, Ruqaiyya?

277
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,380
Searching and probing like this, she

278
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,450
Will lose something which is hers.

279
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,733
Where is she?

280
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,439
Call her here.

281
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,479
I will talk to her.

282
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,420
Come in, my dear.

283
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,089
She was outside, waiting for you to call her.

284
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,834
What is all of this, my dear?

285
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,411
You're remembering the one

286
00:20:41,411 --> 00:20:44,492
Who should've been forgotten?

287
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:47,565
And you're reminding him, too?

288
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:49,361
No way.

289
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,691
Give me that letter.

290
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,530
In fact, bring me the rest of them too.

291
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,739
We'll consider it a sacrificial offering

292
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,081
To mark your engagement when we burn those letters.

293
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:04,244
Whom will you serve those coconut biscuits?

294
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,279
Whom will you see and say, 'When she comes, it feels as if Afzal has come'?

295
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:16,029
I do not need such consolations, my dear.

296
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,949
Afzal is here.

297
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,320
If she gets married this Sunday,

298
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,260
Afzal will be gone again.

299
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,640
Was she the one who used to write those letters?

300
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:38,919
Yes.

301
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,549
No.

302
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,930
That's completely wrong.

303
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,839
That can't be.

304
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,431
She didn't write those letters -- She --

305
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:48,849
She was ready to swear on the Holy Qur'an.

306
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,990
She was telling the truth.

307
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,523
She wasn't lying one bit!

308
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:01,310
She wasn't lying one bit, yes.

309
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,709
But she'll admit it today

310
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:05,602
That she wrote the letters.

311
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:08,959
You should admit it too. Please.

312
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,259
The car's here.

313
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:20,959
Car?

314
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:23,709
I'm going to meet Farah.

315
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:30,825
Allow me, please.

316
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,180
You've met her last night too.

317
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,360
You didn't ask for my permission last night.

318
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,199
I thought you'd stop me because it was late.

319
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:46,130
And I feared that I'd go regardless.

320
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:49,699
I didn't ask for permission so that I don't show disrespect.

321
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,439
What'll you do today?

322
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,759
I won't allow you today either.

323
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,119
Today, too, I'll go regardless.

324
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,210
For now, I'm obligated to disrespect this command.

325
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,956
What did she just say, Ruqaiyya?

326
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,506
How respectfully has she said

327
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,676
That she'd disrespect my command!

328
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,020
She's pronounced her judgement as she left, Molvi Sahab.

329
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:44,217
She's decided she won't live under the same roof as Afzal.

330
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,749
What happened?

331
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,489
Who was there in the car?

332
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:15,660
Yasmin.

333
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:45,051
Try as much as you like, Yasmin, she'll not admit it.

334
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:47,014
She will, today.

335
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:50,332
The circumstances and evidence have changed.

336
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:55,071
She'll be saying to you in a while that she's written the letters.

337
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,511
Where is she?

338
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,231
In her room as usual.

339
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,161
She's suddenly started offering additional prayers.

340
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,023
Go up, turn right, first room on the left, right?

341
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,241
Yes.

342
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,050
Don't come upstairs today.

343
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,620
Seriously.

344
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,160
Don't.

345
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,387
Hold it there!

346
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,350
Offer the rest of your prayers after I've left.

347
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,957
I dropped in again, didn't I?

348
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,016
Sorry, Farah, but I had no option.

349
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:05,426
I've sworn I'd leave only after having you admit it.

350
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:08,036
Admit what?

351
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:10,983
Sit.

352
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,430
Say that you're the Farah who wrote those letters.

353
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:31,046
I swear by God --
-Don't swear!

354
00:26:31,046 --> 00:26:33,116
Just say it for someone's sake.

355
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,946
Why should I say it, mate?

356
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:38,546
Because the Farah who wrote those letters isn't anyone else.

357
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,499
What?

358
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:41,556
What do you mean?

359
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,356
Alright, remember:

360
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:48,799
You'd see him outside school sometimes,

361
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,517
And sometimes, at the gates of your college.

362
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,560
Yes, I used to see him.

363
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:56,334
In fact, I used to see him outside the college very often.

364
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:58,604
Because Arifa used to study there.

365
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:01,224
He used to come to pick her up.

366
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:06,616
He came to see you, Farah.

367
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,251
He used to glimpse you, secretly.

368
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,679
You, the daughter of the owner of Ibrahim Cottons,

369
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,240
And he, the son of a poor Molvi.

370
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,219
That is why he never mustered the courage to say anything or talk to you.

371
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:25,619
So?

372
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,209
And when he felt

373
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:30,319
That he'd never be able to talk to you,

374
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,309
To tell you that he loves you,

375
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:37,499
So, he took the other route to his love.

376
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,359
What has he done?

377
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,329
He started writing letters from you to Afzal.

378
00:27:49,282 --> 00:27:52,330
That which he had wanted to tell you,

379
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,310
He believed he had,

380
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,740
And that which he wanted to hear from you

381
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,240
He wrote in his letters which he'd read to his friends.

382
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,735
He believed in his mind

383
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:11,507
That you loved him,

384
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:13,985
But also accepted

385
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:16,777
That you can never be his.

386
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:19,365
I feel sorry for him...

387
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,226
Yes.

388
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:23,985
I feel sorry for him too.

389
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,499
He's admitted it?

390
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:32,872
Obviously,

391
00:28:32,872 --> 00:28:35,020
He'd have admitted it now that he's been caught.

392
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,940
He's been caught, Farah.

393
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,129
But he's not admitted it

394
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:43,917
Because I never asked him to admit it.

395
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,762
That's your fault, then.

396
00:28:45,762 --> 00:28:47,573
He's your fiancé.

397
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:49,592
You should've grabbed his collar and said,

398
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:50,602
'Hey Mister'!

399
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:52,543
'What's this business'?

400
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:55,047
Did this start today?

401
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:59,350
And will this end with tomorrow?

402
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:05,256
This will go on until he dies, Farah,

403
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:08,906
Or love itself dies.

404
00:29:08,951 --> 00:29:10,836
Interesting...

405
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,336
So, now you want

406
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,686
That I forgive him.

407
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,396
No, Farah.

408
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:36,836
Now, I want that you confess it.

409
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:40,796
Admit it that you love Afzal

410
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:48,426
And admit it

411
00:29:48,426 --> 00:29:51,964
That you had written all those letters.

412
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,270
Very funny.

413
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:59,277
I don't think I'm crazy like you!

414
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:01,137
Honestly,

415
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:02,887
Are you actually his fiancée

416
00:30:02,887 --> 00:30:05,781
Or just say it to terrorise us?

417
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,133
You could think it's just like that...

418
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:13,287
I just say it to terrorise you.

419
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:17,177
The blighter had terrorised me when he first met me.

420
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:19,787
Said, 'I'll throw you out'!

421
00:30:21,494 --> 00:30:22,779
No!

422
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,399
He didn't throw me out.

423
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,049
Just

424
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:28,660
Said it for the sake of saying.

425
00:30:30,136 --> 00:30:33,447
He doesn't know how to talk to girls.

426
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,309
He'll learn when he talks to you.

427
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:42,447
But now that he's been with me for a few days,

428
00:30:42,447 --> 00:30:43,746
He's learnt something.

429
00:30:43,746 --> 00:30:45,886
Said it very politely when he came for the engagement,

430
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,886
'Will you get engaged to me'?

431
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:50,856
It felt as if --

432
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,210
As if --

433
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,850
He'd cursed me!

434
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,490
Cursed?

435
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,160
Who says, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

436
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,620
If he loved me, he'd have said,

437
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,290
'Will you marry me'?

438
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:12,361
I swear by you,

439
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,848
I would never have thought who writes him letters then!

440
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:18,277
Whether you're the Farah or someone else,

441
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:21,237
I would've trampled her underfoot!

442
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:24,628
He deserved a girl like you

443
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,792
Who'd break others to pieces for his love.

444
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:31,318
He only wanted you

445
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:35,079
Who'd broken him to pieces.

446
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:39,539
He'd come from Hyderabad a broken man.

447
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,009
One who comes broken from Hyderabad

448
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:45,109
Cannot be patched in Karachi.

449
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:48,870
He said to me a day before the engagement, 'Yasmin',

450
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,460
'I don't love you'.

451
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,449
And I'd known he'd say that

452
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,494
Because he never knew love

453
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:59,615
Except for his love.

454
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,490
When he came to talk about the engagement, it felt

455
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,300
Like he'd come to amuse me.

456
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:13,701
You were getting engaged on that day,

457
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,416
So he'd come to give a befitting reply.

458
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:22,571
I, too, thought, 'Get on with the engagement'.

459
00:32:22,571 --> 00:32:24,201
'What's an engagement'?

460
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:27,321
'The moment he'd turn to look back',

461
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,651
'It'd break'.

462
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,030
I'm getting married this Sunday.

463
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,010
It'll all be clear this Sunday.

464
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,528
You'll see,

465
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:49,460
He'll marry you this Sunday.

466
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,568
He'll give the same befitting reply again.

467
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:55,788
Why, Farah?

468
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:59,368
Why must it only be the two of you who play this game of befitting replies?

469
00:32:59,294 --> 00:33:02,668
How say I play my move this time?

470
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:05,680
And when I do, you'll realise,

471
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,670
That one who comes broken from Karachi

472
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,319
Cannot be patched in Hyderabad.

473
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,666
Don't break off your engagement!
-Not at all!

474
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,896
I would never.

475
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:25,770
But what do I do about him?

476
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:29,130
When he startles at the sound of your name,

477
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,599
The engagement breaks.

478
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,400
No -- He's nobody to me;

479
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,330
I know he's Arifa's brother,

480
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,220
Molvi Sahab's son,

481
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,800
And now also that he writes letters to himself under my name...

482
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,789
The blighter!

483
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:48,247
You love this blighter.

484
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:54,898
No?

485
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:57,297
You'd die without him.

486
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:00,308
Very funny.

487
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:05,139
You look for him when you can't find him around,

488
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:08,619
And look for him so that nobody else can ever get him.

489
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,149
Oh -- No, it's nothing like that!

490
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,809
I don't love him!

491
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:14,919
I don't even think about him!

492
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,959
Y -- You can

493
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,590
Have me swear on it!
-Alright.

494
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,430
Swear on it.

495
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:27,811
Swear by God you don't love Afzal.

496
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:31,112
He's watching you right here,

497
00:34:33,632 --> 00:34:35,161
Show Him;

498
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:39,161
Tell Him you don't love Afzal.

499
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,201
She's found out that this Farah had written the letters.

500
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:58,451
How?

501
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,561
How did she find out?

502
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:03,291
Miss Mary D'Souza was a teacher at Farah's school.

503
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,592
She mentioned her name in a letter.

504
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:09,072
The same letter which Yasmin has in her bag.

505
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:18,250
There's just one way left for you.

506
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,919
Swear to God and say

507
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:22,909
That you don't love Farah Ibrahim.

508
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,576
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son.

509
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:33,191
You wouldn't swear to God over a falsehood, would you?

510
00:36:34,173 --> 00:36:35,633
Stop.

511
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,424
What about Yasmin?

512
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,029
She'll be coming back after having her admit it for real.

513
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:48,949
And what if she actually admitted to it?

514
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,489
What about your engagement?

515
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:52,420
It'll break, won't it?

516
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:55,657
Answer me!
-She'll never admit it.

517
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:59,227
She'll swear over it and say she'd not written the letters.

518
00:36:59,227 --> 00:37:02,877
And it is indeed true, Arifa, that she's not written the letters.

519
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:06,236
Then Miss Mary D'Souza -- Her handwriting --?

520
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:07,507
I told you

521
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:10,206
That's not her handwriting.

522
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,829
Don't you feel ashamed to think

523
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:28,282
That she loves you, and she's searching for the one

524
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:30,749
Whom you love?

525
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:35,250
Come.

526
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,250
Come on, mate.

527
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:45,060
You'd started going down the path of God, so where have you ended up?

528
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,019
Nowhere.

529
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:54,446
You'd just left Hyderabad and ended up in Karachi.

530
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:59,386
And here you are, thinking whether

531
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:02,426
You've never left Hyderabad,

532
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:05,454
Or never returned from Karachi.

533
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,780
How are you, Mr Fiancé?

534
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,017
Come inside.

535
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,978
I saw you playing cricket.

536
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:48,548
You're such an ace, mate!

537
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:50,568
Don't say 'mate;' Dad may hear it!

538
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:54,508
These are mere parting discourtesies, my dear;

539
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,247
Then, who knows what may become of me

540
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:58,467
And you?

541
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,535
Tell him to not look at me with such fury!

542
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:15,284
Don't look at her with such fury!

543
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:17,004
Why did you go there?

544
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,635
Eh?

545
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:25,844
For the sake of Molvi Uncle's coconut biscuits.

546
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:28,444
Please agree to what I'm saying!

547
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:34,026
And for your Mum's sake.

548
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:38,096
She sees your image in Farah.

549
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:43,284
