1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,569
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,569 --> 00:00:18,853
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,935
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:30,423
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:35,912
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:40,404
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:33,670
What's the wounded's real name?

8
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,650
Babu Hamid.

9
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,014
Who shot him?

10
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,003
Wali and his hoodlums.

11
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,829
You'd come here before, right?

12
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:43,465
With another wounded

13
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:44,966
Who'd been shot in the leg?

14
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,007
Yes.

15
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:47,779
Who are the two of them to you?

16
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,388
They're our tenants.

17
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,918
Wali had shot him, too?
-Yes.

18
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,105
There!

19
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:55,808
That's what happens when you don't file a complaint.

20
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,626
Is there any guardian or relative with him?

21
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:58,996
There's the two of us.

22
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,494
You're the landlady.

23
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:02,582
What about his family?

24
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,621
He has no family.

25
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:06,426
There!

26
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,668
He's here, too.

27
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,357
Peace be upon you, Uncle.

28
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:13,163
And upon you, peace.

29
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,276
My dear,

30
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,085
How is he now?

31
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:17,415
No idea.

32
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:19,271
They've taken him to the operation theatre,

33
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,806
But they're not telling anything when I ask.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,606
This is Afzal's landlady,

35
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,000
And this is her daughter, Yasmin.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,595
Peace be upon you.

37
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,050
And upon you, peace.

38
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:37,830
Is his condition rather serious?

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,294
He's taken a lot of bullets.

40
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,820
How are you?

41
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,230
I'll be walking by tomorrow.

42
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,160
I've checked,

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,033
I have no difficulty walking.

44
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:02,441
Is any of you a relative of Babu Hamid's?

45
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:06,307
Under whose name would the complaint be filed?

46
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,841
We'll talk after the operation's been done.

47
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:12,915
May we talk about ourselves for now?

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,596
Babu Hamid had come to save me.

49
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,697
Do you know why he was crying buckets?

50
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:57,703
For his friend.

51
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,922
No.

52
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,825
For Yasmin.

53
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,263
He'd be cursing his friend.

54
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:04,135
If he hadn't taken bullets at that very moment,

55
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,869
The two of them would've met today, for sure!

56
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,937
Met?

57
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,198
Well, they couldn't really have met...

58
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,576
We'd dropped in, too.

59
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,675
Please, Farah,

60
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:18,565
His friend's stuck between life and death,

61
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,849
He can't move without a wheelchair,

62
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,959
And you think he'd think of a date at such a moment?

63
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,050
Then, you haven't seen how she's stuck!

64
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,723
Yasmin on one side, and you on the other.

65
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:29,990
I?

66
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,354
You're here, too, aren't you?

67
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,016
Yasmin would've called before coming,

68
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:35,779
And you've come without.

69
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:38,826
He's just hiding his face from you.

70
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:41,588
Even Karachi's water can't have its effect...

71
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:44,493
You're here in the same condition you left in.

72
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:45,471
You're here now, aren't you?

73
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,045
You should drink Karachi's water.

74
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,560
If the Lord wills, it'll kill you off

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
Where there'll not be a drop of relief.

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,689
Why are we standing here?

77
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,700
We could go where the struggle's going on.

78
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,604
Come.

79
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,710
If there's a man with you, please call him.

80
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,430
Yes?

81
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,369
Tell me.

82
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,406
Four bullets had struck him,

83
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:13,585
Three in the stomach,

84
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,087
And one right here by the heart.

85
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:19,832
The one that struck the heart was very dangerous.

86
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,363
He's --

87
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,004
Alright, isn't he?

88
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,083
No.

89
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,555
We couldn't save him.

90
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,420
Would you look at that!

91
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,860
My heart knew

92
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,247
There'd be such a scene going on here.

93
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,119
He's dead, Farah,

94
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:10,921
That's why this 'scene' is going on.

95
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,946
His wounds were bleeding today, too.

96
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:46,424
The poor man.

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,639
He's gotten himself mired in so many troubles ever since he came here.

98
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,018
If he came here with his parents' curses,

99
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:55,588
This was bound to happen.

100
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:56,963
Shut up, Farah!

101
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,677
Parents don't curse.

102
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,111
Maybe not a curse,

103
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:02,982
But their wails do work.

104
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,247
I've seen his parents torment for him.

105
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:08,014
They even feared

106
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:10,389
That he may bolt his room from the inside in his anger.

107
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,795
Someone's died, Farah!

108
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,339
Someone's lost his life.

109
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,286
Don't you feel any sorrow over it?

110
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,635
This has all happened because of him, innit?

111
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:20,367
I heard everything at the mourning.

112
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,803
The poor man

113
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:22,825
Had gone

114
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,079
To save Afzal's beloved from the killer.

115
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,165
And do you know why this had come to be?

116
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,450
Because Afzal

117
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,080
Had beaten Yasmin's cousin before everyone!

118
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,110
Cousin, as in,

119
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,849
The killer.

120
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,371
I've heard everything about him, too.

121
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,318
He's the neighbourhood's ace hoodlum.

122
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:43,169
In fact,

123
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,432
He's got a handful of neighbourhoods under him.

124
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,517
Shut up, Farah.

125
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,834
I'd been quiet for three hours there, hadn't I?

126
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:52,086
I've seen every scene put up by everyone.

127
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,029
Remember

128
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,370
How that Yasmin was getting dizzy?

129
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,721
Would you look at that!

130
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,375
No bond or tie whatsoever -

131
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,783
Does one weep like that

132
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,671
For just a tenant?

133
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:05,048
I understand such weeping very well.

134
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:09,350
She was looking for Afzal's shoulder to cry on.

135
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,539
She'd be thinking

136
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:13,367
Of Afzal's shoulder to cry on as an excuse to wrap herself around him.

137
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,350
You're raving mad.

138
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,293
Who knows what you're talking of!

139
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:18,848
Did I say anything wrong?

140
00:09:18,848 --> 00:09:20,783
If you didn't, tell me,

141
00:09:20,783 --> 00:09:23,120
What's our relation with Afzal?

142
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,062
Why had your Dad come looking for him?

143
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:28,658
And why have we come to take him back?

144
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:31,315
You'll find out when you've seen the world

145
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:34,380
That you won't find any compassion in ties of blood,

146
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,097
And you'd find passions driven by a thirst for blood.

147
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,510
I, too, have come with someone's sorrow as a weight on my heart,

148
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,370
Because I feel that when a mother torments over separation from her son,

149
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,870
It falls on all mothers to torment in her pain.

150
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:00,302
Tormenting in someone's pain, too, is a kind of a tie, Farah.

151
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:06,389
If I'm tormented out of this tie, that girl must be, too.

152
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,021
Try and get this across to her,

153
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:17,223
Or tell her to go to sleep.

154
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,514
What would you get it across to me?

155
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:23,279
I'm doing all of this for you!

156
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,908
Otherwise, she may wrap herself around Afzal

157
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,389
For all I care!

158
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,157
Come.

159
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,524
Sir, this...

160
00:10:47,524 --> 00:10:49,768
This is our house in Karachi.

161
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:50,784
Now,

162
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,152
You'd stay here until your wound's healed.

163
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:59,146
I've talked to the doctors; one of them will check you regularly here.

164
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:03,853
But, sir --
-You've done a lot as you wanted to.

165
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:08,364
Even if you've not made any mistake, it feels as if you have.

166
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:13,351
So, it's not proper that you reply to me with any 'but',

167
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,991
Or want

168
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,520
That you be left to yourself in this condition.

169
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,007
Stay here a few days,

170
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:22,759
And you may go wherever you please once you get better.

171
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,310
Come with me.

172
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,214
Carefully now. Good.

173
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,919
Room #9.

174
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,891
Yes.

175
00:11:41,891 --> 00:11:43,821
Right.

176
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,446
What?

177
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,296
When?

178
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,956
Alright, thanks.

179
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:54,872
Thank you.

180
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,039
Here.

181
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,341
Have something.

182
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,621
How could I have anything, Mam?

183
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:08,717
He's left, too.

184
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:11,100
Who's left?

185
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,496
Afzal...

186
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,740
But this was bound to happen.

187
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,350
The very day she'd come here, looking for him,

188
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,057
Was the day my heart had told me,

189
00:12:23,057 --> 00:12:25,960
'It's a call to Afzal'.

190
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,500
He's not at the hospital?

191
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,349
No.

192
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:34,060
He's left the room.

193
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,260
And those who'd come from Hyderabad, looking for him,

194
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,762
Have taken him along to Hyderabad.

195
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,328
Surely, he wasn't so uncultured?

196
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,413
He's stayed here for three months.

197
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,199
He'd have some shame about our dealings.

198
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,918
Plus, he's a Molvi's son,

199
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:55,250
Surely, he can't be so treacherous!

200
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,730
He'd come here someday to account for his shame.

201
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,275
He'd bring her along.

202
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,928
He'd say,

203
00:13:02,928 --> 00:13:05,233
'She's my wife'.

204
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:11,029
But she said she was nobody to him?

205
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,401
That's how I'd reasoned it out with you.

206
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:18,987
Do you remember what you'd said in reply?

207
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,798
Take the dinner away.

208
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,900
I'll start eating tomorrow.

209
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:36,170
In sorrow, one would rather stay hungry just as a formality, if nothing else...

210
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,363
So he doesn't have a phone with him even now?

211
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,853
That's where he'd been clever!

212
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,730
He neither kept a phone, nor gave me a number.

213
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,159
The blighter would've thought from the outset,

214
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:51,034
'I'd fly away and disappear the moment I feel like'.

215
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,789
Just think that he was a talking parrot.

216
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,410
Enjoyed his treats for a few days,

217
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,030
Talking to us,

218
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,963
And, having engrossed us in his words, flew away.

219
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,807
Good night, Mam.

220
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,559
Hey!

221
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,212
You're here, sleeping!

222
00:14:32,212 --> 00:14:35,108
Do you even know who's come here?

223
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,237
Who?

224
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:38,510
It'll get you wide awake if you heard it.

225
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,220
You'd sit before the mirror, setting your hair right.

226
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,786
Oh...

227
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:48,353
He's staying here tonight.

228
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,084
Who?

229
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,298
The same

230
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:55,026
Who's a watermelon and red on the inside.

231
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:56,230
Watermelon?

232
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,147
Yes.

233
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,352
Dad says,

234
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,900
'To find a gentleman among men'

235
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,651
'Is like finding from a heap of watermelons one'

236
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,089
'That's bright red on the inside'.

237
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:06,990
The rapscallion!

238
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,432
He's red, I give you that!
-Oh, shut up!

239
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:11,577
Who's come?

240
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,090
Not now. I'll tell you in the morning.

241
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,703
He's fallen asleep now.

242
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,898
I opened the door and had a look at him.

243
00:15:16,898 --> 00:15:19,291
He's sleeping peacefully.

244
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,438
Get out.

245
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:23,894
What?

246
00:15:23,894 --> 00:15:25,686
I said get lost!

247
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,032
I'm in no mood to hear a load of guff.

248
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:29,526
I couldn't sleep,

249
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:32,353
So I thought I'd come here and talk to you.

250
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,946
But you're not a good choice.

251
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,631
Now, I'll go and wake him up,

252
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:39,129
And talk about everything with him.

253
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,914
Halt.

254
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,784
Tell me,

255
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,189
Who is it?

256
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,172
Afzal.

257
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,928
Here?

258
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,740
Not here, over there.

259
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,328
In the guests' room below.

260
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,517
Who brought him here?

261
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:01,949
Dad.

262
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:03,543
Hey!

263
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:04,575
The poor man,

264
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,965
He was griefstricken over his friend.

265
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,015
Dad thought

266
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,952
He'd be looked after here,

267
00:16:09,952 --> 00:16:14,110
And comforted, too, if necessary.

268
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,940
Bless you.

269
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,178
Thank you.

270
00:16:17,178 --> 00:16:19,418
Bless you, too.

271
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:20,333
He's

272
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,233
Just limping a little.

273
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,550
Pray that he gets better.

274
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,859
Go.

275
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,691
I've prayed.

276
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:29,759
Know what, Dad said he'd take him

277
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,219
To Hyderabad when he gets better.

278
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:31,976
Just see,

279
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:34,750
I won't let him go away from there, then!

280
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,410
You?

281
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,740
Yes.

282
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,700
He's begun obeying everything I say.

283
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,218
I said,

284
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,060
'Take your medicines',

285
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,321
And he took them instantly.

286
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:49,580
I said, 'Have your soup',

287
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,126
And he had his soup instantly.

288
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,779
And when I said 'Go to sleep',
-He fell asleep instantly?

289
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,200
Obviously.

290
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,125
Wait and watch. I'll go and wake him up,

291
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,062
He'd get up in a moment.

292
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,389
Go, then,

293
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,131
And wake him up.

294
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:05,186
One day, he'd wake you up,

295
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,231
And you'd come to me, crying, saying,

296
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:08,282
'Farah',

297
00:17:08,282 --> 00:17:13,050
'See how long it took me to wake up'!

298
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,031
Good night, Farah.

299
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,061
Are you awake?

300
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,369
Who is it?

301
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,811
It's me, Lubna.

302
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:29,938
Yes...

303
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:32,287
I'm awake?

304
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,219
Awake, as in, I may come in, right?

305
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,929
Easy there, lie down.

306
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:43,429
Hey!

307
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,425
So you have a cellphone, too?

308
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,003
No, it's

309
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,066
My friend's.

310
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,116
Oh...

311
00:17:49,116 --> 00:17:50,522
The poor man.

312
00:17:50,522 --> 00:17:53,861
Call Arifa when it's charged.

313
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,296
No.

314
00:17:56,296 --> 00:17:59,138
I won't call them for a while.

315
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:00,739
I've sworn an oath.

316
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:02,132
Wouldn't you go to Hyderabad?

317
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,970
I will, someday.

318
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,517
What do you mean, 'someday'?

319
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,530
You're going one of these days.

320
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,420
We haven't come to Karachi on a tour.

321
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,396
We'd take you along.

322
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:14,034
I said I'm not going now.

323
00:18:14,034 --> 00:18:18,323
Have you lost your heart to Yasmin?

324
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,808
Why do you lose your heart

325
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:25,620
To a new lass every few months?

326
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,130
What's your star?

327
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,072
Must be Leo.

328
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:31,741
Don't worry, though.

329
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:33,486
If you still feel

330
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,560
That you love Yasmin after going back,

331
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,084
Come over to Karachi with a wedding procession.

332
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:39,950
Look,

333
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,720
Yasmin's a very good girl, but --
-If she's so good, why this 'but'?

334
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,426
Shoot away all your older love stories --

335
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,325
Speaking of shooting,

336
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:52,949
You've taken a bullet for her, too, haven't you?

337
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,424
What would you hide from me, now?

338
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,871
I know everything.

339
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,201
In fact, Farah does, too.

340
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,286
Actually, she's the one who'd told me.

341
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:02,287
When she wrapped herself around you, weeping,

342
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:03,723
Farah had seen that.

343
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:05,157
She said the moment she saw it,

344
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,120
'Would you look at their love'!

345
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,640
I'd seen some of it for myself, too.

346
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,750
She felt dizzy thrice at the mourning,

347
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,781
And she'd looked your way before she got dizzy all three times.

348
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,222
Please, Lubna,

349
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,860
My friend's death is no joke.

350
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,052
You're right there...

351
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:25,898
But the love of those who live is not joke either.

352
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,354
Fleeing Hyderabad like cowards,

353
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:30,427
Two-timing the Farah from the letters,

354
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:32,654
Attempting an engagement with our Farah,

355
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:37,712
And this affair of the heart with Yasmin is no joke either.

356
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:41,033
Your Mum, Dad, and Arifa at home are tormented for you,

357
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:46,618
And you're stumbling around in your love for a new comely lassie?

358
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,012
By the Lord, I don't love Yasmin.

359
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:54,948
Right...

360
00:19:54,948 --> 00:19:57,447
Whose turn is it this time?

361
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,306
It's my turn.

362
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,044
I won't play that gambit this time

363
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:08,800
To win which I'd have to lose my heart.

364
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,027
I've come from Hyderabad, having learnt

365
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:15,950
That love matters to us,

366
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,188
But we don't matter to love.

367
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:25,282
Have you taken your medicines?

368
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:28,046
I have.

369
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,207
Go to sleep, now.

370
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,061
And refrain from talking about love

371
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:36,088
Until the end of your course of medicines.

372
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,953
Good night.

373
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,207
Listen,

374
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:41,977
Give me the phone.

375
00:20:41,977 --> 00:20:43,843
Sure.

376
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,475
Good night.

377
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,071
It's my turn.

378
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,397
I won't play that gambit this time

379
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:29,363
To win which I'd have to lose my heart.

380
00:21:29,363 --> 00:21:32,617
I've come from Hyderabad, having learnt

381
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:36,570
That love matters to us,

382
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,900
But we don't matter to love.

383
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,523
Done with your little chat?

384
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,500
Yes...

385
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,319
I finally asked about Yasmin today.

386
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,728
Doubting someone isn't good, so to speak,

387
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,227
But you'd gotten this doubt into my heart.

388
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,035
I thought I'd ask this

389
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,200
Now that I'm talking about so much.

390
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,758
And he'd have said,

391
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:00,730
'Not at all',

392
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,383
'It's nothing like that'.

393
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:03,432
No.

394
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,287
He didn't say that.

395
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:10,970
He said, 'By the Lord, I don't love Yasmin'.

396
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,933
That means

397
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:17,181
He doesn't love Yasmin.

398
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,850
Good night.

399
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,577
Yasmin!

400
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,273
Get up, Yasmin!

401
00:22:43,273 --> 00:22:45,124
Your phone's ringing.

402
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:46,232
Get up and see

403
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,986
Who it is.

404
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:57,406
Babu Hamid?

405
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:00,956
Don't worry, it'd be him.

406
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:02,933
Afzal.

407
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,459
Hello?

408
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,694
It's Afzal here.

409
00:23:07,694 --> 00:23:08,614
Hey!

410
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:11,059
I thought you'd run away.

411
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,003
Where would I run away to, now?

412
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:14,900
I'd come back any of these days.

413
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,170
You'd stay here, won't you?

414
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,520
I don't know where I'd stay.

415
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,204
But I'd stay in Karachi.

416
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:31,650
Should I get you something to eat, now?

417
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,660
Yes.

418
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,970
No, Uncle Ibrahim, they wouldn't have fallen asleep at all!

419
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,870
The two of them stay awake all night.

420
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,370
Dad!

421
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,048
Dad!
-Yes?

422
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,093
Uncle Ibrahim's calling.
-Oh?

423
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,765
Begin in the Lord's name! [Auspicious beginning]

424
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:51,931
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur!

425
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,571
And upon you, peace.

426
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:54,662
I hope

427
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,430
I've not woken you up?

428
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,389
No, Monseigneur,

429
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:02,005
We've been sleeping for five days, hopeful

430
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,820
That if the Lord wills thus, you would call,

431
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,246
And we'd wake up at the sound of your voice.

432
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,570
Please, wake us up today.

433
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,250
We can't

434
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,422
Pretend to sleep anymore.

435
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:16,610
I've found him.

436
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,580
Praise the Lord!

437
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,425
Monseigneur's found him!

438
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:29,189
May the Lord

439
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:31,820
Give you your due reward for this noble deed, Monseigneur!

440
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,208
May the Lord always keep you happy, Monseigneur!

441
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,770
Where's the rapscallion?
-He's here, with me.

442
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,300
I've brought him over to my place.

443
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,122
Alright.

444
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,626
He'd be nearby, listening?

445
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:48,900
No, he doesn't know I'm talking to you.

446
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,710
Oh?

447
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,765
Get to Karachi tomorrow,

448
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,618
And bring Madame along.

449
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,673
Just

450
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:57,946
Disconnect the call, we'd leave right now.

451
00:24:57,946 --> 00:24:59,480
No, not right now.

452
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,230
Get here tomorrow evening.

453
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,494
Lubna's just told me that he's not ready to go to Hyderabad,

454
00:25:07,494 --> 00:25:12,000
And I don't want either that he should suspect you're coming.

455
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,050
Does he not miss even his mother?

456
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,717
He says, 'I' --

457
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,250
'Won't go back to Hyderabad'.

458
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:20,998
No,

459
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:25,609
Let me talk.
-Jus -- Just a minute, Ruqaiyya.

460
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:28,103
His face --

461
00:25:28,103 --> 00:25:30,893
His appearance is the same, innit?

462
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:33,940
Don't worry, he's the same.

463
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,370
He isn't the same at all, Monseigneur.

464
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,485
The blighter's heart has changed...

465
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,519
Is he sleeping?

466
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,356
Yes.

467
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,641
Your Afzal is sleeping.

468
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:53,411
I'd said it, Ruqaiyya, hadn't I,

469
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:56,520
'We're not dear'

470
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,600
'To our dear son'.

471
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,729
Thank you so much, Monseigneur.

472
00:26:09,729 --> 00:26:11,759
Please give your address

473
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,416
To Arifa.

474
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:16,722
There's no need to give any address.

475
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:19,106
My driver would be there tomorrow evening,

476
00:26:19,106 --> 00:26:21,074
Just get in the car with him and come over.

477
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:24,128
What's the need, Monseigneur?

478
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,669
It's very much needed, Molvi Sahab.

479
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:28,896
Please, don't refuse.

480
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,040
As you command.

481
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,307
God be with ye.

482
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:34,850
May God watch over you.

483
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,020
What does he say?

484
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,612
He says, 'I'll send a car; get in and come over'.

485
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:43,910
And he says he's not coming to Hyderabad?

486
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,425
Let him say if he wants to!

487
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:49,300
I'd plead with him

488
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,870
With folded hands,

489
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,050
I'd take off my turban and place it in his feet,

490
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,105
What could he say, then?

491
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,107
We're

492
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:11,264
Parents, Ruqaiyya,

493
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,371
It's on us to keep trying everything.

494
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:18,450
And she's going along, too!

495
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:20,145
She'd even

496
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:21,605
Grab the unduteous lad

497
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:25,105
By his collar!

498
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,109
He'd come if you call him.

499
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,116
Otherwise, he'd stay in hiding.

500
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:52,314
What'd you do if he came?

501
00:27:52,314 --> 00:27:54,895
What's left to be done?

502
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:57,617
I'd finish this trivial rivalry.

503
00:27:57,617 --> 00:28:00,630
He'd think we want to hand him over to the police.

504
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,990
He won't think that.

505
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,020
He knows that no complaint was filed against him.

506
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,408
He'd think you're afraid of him.

507
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:13,810
He'd seize and take away a scared Yasmin.

508
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,760
That'd happen only when he'd think that I'm afraid of him.

509
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,760
That's what he'd say if you talk about ending this rivalry.

510
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,140
He'd say, 'Give me Yasmin',

511
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,930
'And our rivalry ends'.

512
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:27,240
I've given him Babu Hamid's corpse.

513
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,630
I'll say, 'That's enough'.

514
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,400
You don't know him, Afzal.

515
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,460
He doesn't know me either, Yasmin.

516
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,020
Just call him once,

517
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,660
But don't tell him that I'll be there to meet him, too.

518
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,820
Then I'd say whatever comes to mind.

519
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,480
Sure.

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,343
Say whatever comes to your mind.

521
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,286
Alright, I'll disconnect.

522
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:54,652
I'd await your call.

523
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,954
What is it, Yasmin?

524
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,063
Afzal's afraid of Wali, Mam.

525
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,820
What is this, Arifa?

526
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,324
It's Mum's things and clothes, Dad.

527
00:29:38,324 --> 00:29:40,149
I'm locking the door.

528
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:41,247
Hold on,

529
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,225
Wait, Ruqaiyya.

530
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:46,620
Why are you taking such a large suitcase?

531
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,177
How many days would you stay there?

532
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:50,150
As many days as it takes.

533
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,150
Remember

534
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,073
What Monseigneur had said.

535
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,711
He's not agreeing to come back just yet.

536
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,374
So?

537
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:02,430
So, as long as he stays in Karachi, so will I.

538
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm going along, am I not?

539
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,140
Which means on this very day

540
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll bring him back.

541
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,760
Leave it be, Molvi Sahab.

542
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,820
Our faith does not permit making such claims,

543
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,600
So, get in the car quietly,

544
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,092
And keep praying until we get to Karachi that he agrees to come back.

545
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,450
If he does, alright.

546
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,140
Otherwise, how far is Karachi?

547
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,218
You can come and meet the two of us as and when you please.

548
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,083
Come here,

549
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,231
My good man.

550
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,440
This --

551
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,400
Put this suitcase in the bag.

552
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,310
A son's adamance

553
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:54,360
Is heavier than any suitcase, Molvi Sahab.

554
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,930
Leave it be, good chap.

555
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,255
I'll carry it myself.

556
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:12,850
God sufficeth me. There is no God save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous Throne. [Prayer for strength in times of hardship]

557
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,639
God is the Greatest!

558
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,701
Taking a call?

559
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,234
Lad's the odd sort.

560
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,750
Hello?

561
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,221
It's Afzal speaking.

562
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:44,571
Afzal, you bugger!

563
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,510
Afzal's calling! Afzal!

564
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,390
Where were you, you blighter?

565
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,970
And why

566
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,250
Was your phone switched off?

567
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,330
Do you know

568
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,650
Those who love you weep when the remember you, mate.

569
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,440
I weep when I remember them, too, mate.

570
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,188
But stop crying now.

571
00:32:05,188 --> 00:32:07,400
Bring everyone over here to me.

572
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,050
Where?

573
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,092
Karachi.

574
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,100
Tell them they'd get a job,

575
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,020
And a salary like their stakes.

576
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,610
Who'd give such a job?

577
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,760
I would.

578
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,560
Right,

579
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,700
And what's the job?

580
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,735
You'd have to sacrifice your life for me.

581
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:31,660
He's saying,

582
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,970
'You'd have to sacrifice your life for me'.
-Oh?

583
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,600
What happened, bugger?

584
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
Scared?

585
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:37,970
No --

586
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,200
I was just thinking

587
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,450
That one'd have to get a good salary if one has to sacrifice his life.

588
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,680
What do you say?

589
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,530
Your appointment letter's ready.
-Just take it! Take it!

590
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,841
Alright.

591
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,510
When do we join?

592
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,690
Today.

593
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,630
Right now.

594
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:01,070
Just a minute.

595
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,756
What happened?

596
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,337
What is it?

597
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:08,421
Your family was going

598
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,440
In Monseigneur Ibrahim's car.

599
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,800
Monseigneur, you know?

600
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,880
The mill owner?

601
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,782
With him.

602
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,830
Alright, disconnect the call,

603
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,540
And get here before the evening.

604
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,580
Alright,

605
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,610
We'll be there.

606
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,475
Okay.
-'We'll be there'?

607
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:28,940
Come in, Monsieur le Docteur.

608
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,140
So, how are you?

609
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,275
Now,

610
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:35,698
I've started walking.

611
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:39,408
I'd run away by the evening.

612
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,606
I mean, I'd be running by the evening.

613
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,330
Don't try anything of the sort.

614
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,482
Running isn't good for you.

615
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,803
You've come to collect the rent, haven't you?

616
00:34:50,803 --> 00:34:54,080
You're saying as if you've got the money in your pocket!

617
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,850
That's it.

618
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,450
I have it in my pocket since the morning.

619
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,440
Hold this, will you?

620
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,998
Right here.

621
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,820
I hope it doesn't hurt?

622
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,030
Not much.

623
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,257
Okay.

624
00:35:22,257 --> 00:35:24,641
Here.

625
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:26,144
You can run

626
00:35:26,144 --> 00:35:27,152
After two days.

627
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:28,609
Nothing to worry.

628
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,058
You're taking your medicines, aren't you?

629
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:32,096
Yes.

630
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,756
Have your medicines on time for a few more days.

631
00:35:34,756 --> 00:35:36,198
Sure.

632
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:37,168
Alright,

633
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:37,850
See you.

634
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:40,968
Alright, thank you so much.
-Thank you.

635
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
Listen...

636
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,652
Did you

637
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:50,434
Talk to Arifa?

638
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:51,504
No?

639
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:54,124
Not at all.

640
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:55,116
Surely,

641
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,332
You must be talking now and then?

642
00:35:57,332 --> 00:35:59,470
Yes, I do, sometimes...

643
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,837
How are Mum and Dad?

644
00:36:00,837 --> 00:36:02,560
Only they'd know that...

645
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,370
I've heard that when sons run away from their homes,

646
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,180
One only looks at his Mum and Dad's faces,

647
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,617
One doesn't ask, 'How are you'?

648
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:14,212
Anything else?

649
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,020
No.

650
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,332
Thank you.

651
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,270
May I ask something, now?

652
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,262
Yes?

653
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:22,150
Why do you have this penchant for running?

654
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,290
And if you ran away,

655
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,410
Where'd you go?

656
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,293
To Yasmin?

657
00:36:27,293 --> 00:36:29,340
In that case, give me her number.

658
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,730
I'll call her here.

659
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,861
And if you have any shame left,

660
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:34,467
Don't run away from here.

661
00:36:34,467 --> 00:36:36,770
I understand what you mean very well,

662
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,090
But you'd better understand this nice and clear, too,

663
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:44,851
The hearts of those who hold you dear stop beating when you run away.

664
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,835
Alright,

665
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:05,610
If you marry me, what'd you do to the one sitting at home?

666
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,544
Tell me what I should do.

667
00:37:07,544 --> 00:37:08,720
It's obvious.

668
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,950
Two swords can't share the same sheath.

669
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,960
Oh, she ain't no sword!

670
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,530
You're the sword.

671
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,490
Your very gaze slits throats!

672
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,970
Whatever.

673
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,332
Say it again.

674
00:37:21,332 --> 00:37:22,367
What?

675
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,271
The same.

676
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:24,400
'Whatever'.

677
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,820
You say it so well.

678
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,488
Don't get me busy talking.

679
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:30,390
Send her away if you want to marry me.

680
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,510
I can call her right now if you say.

681
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,710
She'd be gone before the evening.

682
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,523
Get here before the evening.

683
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:38,200
Talk to Mam.

684
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,960
If Mam asks for 500,000 in Mahr [bride price],

685
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,878
Just say, 'Alright'.

686
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:47,210
Don't get all worked up to hear about 500,000. I'm not taking any from you.

687
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,690
Have I turned you down, Yasmin?

688
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:52,720
Forget 500,000, I'd give 1 million.

689
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,950
And if you want, you can have my head along with it.

690
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,850
Say auspicious things.

691
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,467
Auspicious?

692
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:00,364
As in,

693
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,312
At least don't talk about having your head.

694
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:06,970
My late Mam used to say, 'When a girl thinks of someone as her husband',

695
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,740
'One could just as well sacrifice his life for her'.

696
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,370
Just tell me, is it fear or love?

697
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,216
I've fallen in love.

698
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,320
You're lying, sweet wifey.

699
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,040
It is fear, for now.

700
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,894
You'd only begin to love later.

701
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,570
Go and face them,

702
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,820
And tell them you're prepared to die.

703
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,470
I'm not ready to die just yet.

704
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,600
I'm not afraid of dying,

705
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,000
But I want to live on.

706
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
