1
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:13,552
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:18,731
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:23,897
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:30,255
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:35,710
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,029
May I come in, Dad?

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,354
Two minutes; that's all you have.

9
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,774
And, for these two minutes,

10
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:48,135
Stay at an arm's length from me.

11
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:03,042
Go away!

12
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,744
Away!

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,450
Don't touch me.

14
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:16,437
Your mother

15
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:20,373
Had named you.

16
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,810
I'd said back then, 'Ruqaiyya Begum',

17
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,260
'The name's august'.

18
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,998
'It won't be easy'

19
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:36,594
'To live up to and honour it'.

20
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:43,422
Why don't you tell me

21
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:48,020
What kind of an 'Great Person' [Afzal] are you?

22
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,330
Change my name.

23
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:56,851
I don't know who's the greater one around here -

24
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,635
Those who die in their innocence, or the ones whom I've killed,

25
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,481
Who kill 16-something others,

26
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:07,321
And parade around the city fearlessly.

27
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,042
I would've become a great man [Afzal], Dad,

28
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:15,819
If only someone showed me what greatness ought to be like.

29
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,537
You're either at the Mosque, or at home.

30
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,481
With the Lord there, and the Lord's faithful people here.

31
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:29,708
You don't know what's going on here, Dad.

32
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:33,725
A thief who stole 2 billion is bargained with,

33
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:40,326
And another who steals 2,000 is sentenced to two years in prison.

34
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:43,868
It's just that the petty thief is not respected.

35
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:49,866
The greatest of thieves are hailed as the greatest of men.

36
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:53,085
I can't fit in with all of these, Dad,

37
00:03:53,085 --> 00:03:57,460
Which is why I request you to change my name.

38
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,000
Have you convinced your mother?

39
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,275
With my head in her lap,

40
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:19,773
She was running her fingers through my hair.

41
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,697
She's affrighted

42
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,353
That

43
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,947
You may go back.

44
00:04:28,947 --> 00:04:32,387
Tell me, did she say anything?

45
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,576
Did she talk to you --

46
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,496
Any complaint --

47
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,625
Did she carp about you?

48
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,094
No.

49
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,513
Go to her, then,

50
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:45,985
And ask her

51
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,953
To give you a tight slap on your face.

52
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,230
Slapping you

53
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,353
Will build her confidence.

54
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,173
What are you looking at?

55
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,135
Go and give her reason to believe

56
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:14,211
That, even after being slapped, you wouldn't

57
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:18,533
Dare set foot outside the house!

58
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,580
Then, she'd

59
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,548
Talk to you confidently.

60
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:29,211
Otherwise, she'd just keep fearing you.

61
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,866
And you'd do well

62
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:36,969
To fear a mother who's scared, my child.

63
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:56,672
Arifa!

64
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,894
What are you cooking?

65
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:00,848
I think --

66
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:03,677
We can prepare chicken pulao; he enjoys it thoroughly.

67
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,475
And some thin green gram lentil along with it.

68
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:06,320
But no,

69
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,239
I don't know if he'll have that...

70
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,866
Get to work already, what are you looking at? Now --

71
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,180
Get some bread and braised meat ready; I'll prepare whatever he'd like to have.

72
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,710
What would you like, Afzal?

73
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:25,232
I've not been slapped by Mum for so long.

74
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:28,949
I'd like to have that for starters.

75
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,172
May you live long.

76
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:37,658
You've become a great man,

77
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:41,732
But haven't forgotten your mother's silly pastimes.

78
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,480
May you be prosperous, my dear.

79
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:00,710
I'd sworn as I came here

80
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,370
To never go back.

81
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,984
There, now.

82
00:07:03,984 --> 00:07:06,527
What are you talking about?

83
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:10,327
This is your home.

84
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,705
Stay here as long as you like,

85
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:16,577
And leave whenever you want to.

86
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:18,689
You've got a car, now, too.

87
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,222
You need no ticket now,

88
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:24,792
Nor is there the fuss of going to the station.

89
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:29,370
You just have to get in your car and leave.

90
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,625
You're staying here tonight, aren't you?

91
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,762
I'm asking you because if you're staying,

92
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,151
I'll prepare some rice and lentils for you.

93
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:41,949
You used to enjoy it so much.

94
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,440
Won't you forgive me?

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,360
You'll have to, Ruqaiyya Begum.

96
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:57,137
Give him a nice slap and

97
00:07:57,137 --> 00:08:07,984
Settle all scores,

98
00:08:07,984 --> 00:08:12,543
Or I'll be pronouncing a final judgement

99
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,923
And throw him out of the house.

100
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,328
I'll go and see --
-Why would you?

101
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:30,767
If someone rings the bell,

102
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,347
Would your sister go and see, you blighter?

103
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:33,582
Get going!

104
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,332
Go!

105
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:24,379
I've come to meet your wife.

106
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,288
To congratulate her.

107
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,126
In fact,

108
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,625
Congratulations to you, too!

109
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:38,235
You've brought a right comely lassie along from Karachi.

110
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,250
Step aside.

111
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,968
Hey, Arifa!

112
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:00,974
Where are you, mate?

113
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,708
Farah!

114
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,111
Hey!

115
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,353
You've brought flowers!

116
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:08,026
Would you look at that!

117
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:10,618
I've brought these for her.

118
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,869
I'd made friends with her in Karachi.

119
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:15,443
Here.

120
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:17,463
You do remember, don't you?

121
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,520
Yes.

122
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,801
Then embrace me.

123
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:23,620
I've come to congratulate you about your engagement.

124
00:10:26,023 --> 00:10:27,667
Peace be upon you.

125
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,554
And upon you, peace.

126
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:30,820
Molvi Uncle!

127
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,039
Just one prayer has got you hale and hearty!

128
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,102
Do you know what's gotten me hale and hearty?

129
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,356
What?

130
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:42,585
I've gotten used to hearing 'Uncle Molvi'.

131
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,790
I thought

132
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,617
Who'd call me that over there?

133
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,534
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

134
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,005
And upon you, peace.

135
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,347
May you live long.

136
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:58,903
Please, sit.

137
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:01,117
I'll sit with my friends.

138
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,041
Alright.

139
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:02,563
Yes.

140
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:03,799
Go.

141
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:18,544
What are you looking at?

142
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:23,040
She's started a murder spree like you.

143
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,340
She kills

144
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,653
By her mere words.

145
00:11:56,505 --> 00:11:59,257
Alright now, tell me the story.

146
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:02,203
Who said 'I love you' first?

147
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:06,533
Nobody did.

148
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,716
He came to me one day,

149
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:12,467
And said, 'Get engaged to me tomorrow'.

150
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:16,004
Coffee?

151
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:18,058
Yes.

152
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,554
Right,

153
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:26,581
You'd have said yes immediately?

154
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,815
I'd seen it, Yasmin,

155
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,783
I could glimpse him in your eyes.

156
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:34,440
And I could glimpse him in your eyes.

157
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,595
Well,

158
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,519
I didn't say yes immediately either.

159
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,190
I said, 'Why tomorrow'?

160
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,497
'Why don't you talk about the day after'?

161
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,626
As in, you must've just said it as a nicety, so to speak,

162
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,795
As in,

163
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:49,420
Just to feed your own ego.

164
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,474
He didn't let any ego remain.

165
00:12:51,474 --> 00:12:53,297
He said, 'Tomorrow means tomorrow'.

166
00:12:53,297 --> 00:12:55,202
'Neither today, nor the day after'.

167
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:57,476
Why, mate?

168
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,101
May I tell that?

169
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:02,148
Would you rather conceal it even now?

170
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,088
The Farah who wrote the letters was getting engaged that day.

171
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:08,067
He wanted to give her a befitting reply.

172
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,106
No --

173
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:12,874
I was getting engaged that day.

174
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,750
Molvi Uncle had a heart attack at my engagement.

175
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,750
What's the matter?

176
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,935
So you write letters to him?

177
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:35,206
By the Lord, no!

178
00:13:35,206 --> 00:13:35,746
Yes --

179
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:37,659
Her name's Farah, too.

180
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,142
Initially, everyone here suspected it too,

181
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:44,367
But I cleared everything up.

182
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,237
What are you looking at?

183
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,490
Nothing.

184
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,547
That's a right coincidence,

185
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,710
Three engagements on the same day.

186
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,438
Wow...

187
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,839
The two of you weren't even acquainted?

188
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,217
The two of us, as in?

189
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,813
You and Afzal.

190
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:06,182
We were acquainted.

191
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:07,374
He's Arifa's brother,

192
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:08,995
Molvi Uncle's son,

193
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,698
And lives in the neighbourhood,

194
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:13,111
So we were naturally very well acquainted.

195
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:17,265
Then, who's the one who used to write those letters?

196
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:20,637
If she was getting engaged that night, why were you getting engaged that night?

197
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:21,675
What do you mean?

198
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:25,652
I mean, the real coincidence is that both the girls, except for me,

199
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:27,645
Getting engaged that night are named Farah.

200
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,135
Would you think about that!

201
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,550
Why were both of them named Farah?

202
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,092
Why should I think about that?

203
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:34,432
You should.

204
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:37,264
He's your fiancé, after all!

205
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:44,045
I'm his fiancée, Farah,

206
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,737
Not his love.

207
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,030
I'd just

208
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,022
Stepped in to give a befitting reply.

209
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,864
There's nothing to worry about.

210
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,082
These lads have loved at least once or twice before they're married.

211
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:01,352
They might have.

212
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:04,783
But he's only loved once,

213
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:08,952
And as long as he lives, he'll only love her.

214
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:09,776
But then,

215
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,852
Why did you get engaged to him?

216
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:14,821
I'd fallen for him, Farah.

217
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:18,227
The allure of his proposal enticed me.

218
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:21,914
I thought that I deserved at least an engagement to him.

219
00:15:21,914 --> 00:15:24,414
You sound raving mad to me!

220
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,699
You're saying it as if it's not an engagement,

221
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,101
But a temporary arrangement.

222
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,305
The blighter's very handsome.

223
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:36,041
One would lose one's heart to him easily.

224
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:41,021
I'm surprised to wonder why you let him come to Karachi in the first place.

225
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:42,585
I let him?

226
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:44,382
Never mind,

227
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:47,073
Let's talk about you.

228
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:51,505
Don't you think he's handsome?

229
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:54,547
I do.

230
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,546
But he doesn't belong to my class.

231
00:15:56,546 --> 00:15:59,390
He fits in with you nicely.

232
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:04,529
Why are you laughing?

233
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,781
I'm laughing at how you brought class in.

234
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:09,794
I'm remembering the day

235
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,854
When you'd come to our place, looking for him.

236
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,287
Right.

237
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,829
With Dad, right?

238
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,326
'With Dad', so just to speak.

239
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:22,732
It was you who was looking for him.

240
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:32,928
I was just having a look at my cupboard.

241
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,863
You were looking through her letters.

242
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:38,754
Take these and throw them away.

243
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:45,192
You don't need proofs of your previous love to start anew.

244
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:47,193
If you burnt these,

245
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:52,113
It'd ease the poor lassie's searing pain.

246
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,498
You're here until Sunday, aren't you?

247
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:15,766
Yes, perhaps.

248
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:16,640
Alright, then.

249
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,654
We'll have a ball on Sunday.

250
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:20,265
What's on Sunday?

251
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,749
I'm getting married.

252
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,580
Hey!

253
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,049
You've not even been engaged yet.

254
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,909
How can you get married?

255
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,756
Ask Molvi Uncle and tell me,

256
00:18:36,756 --> 00:18:39,149
Is it necessary to get engaged before marriage?

257
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,694
No.

258
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,832
I didn't mean that.

259
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:45,039
I'm just a bit shocked.

260
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,148
So suddenly, so quickly...

261
00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:49,049
I can't believe it.

262
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:51,693
But I can believe now;

263
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:57,048
You, too, have decided to give him a befitting reply!

264
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:00,700
To whom?

265
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,746
That's what nobody can know.

266
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,935
Everyone's giving a befitting reply to someone,

267
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,451
But doesn't tell his name.

268
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:14,376
I'll take my leave.

269
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,662
You'd come just to tell that?

270
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:19,805
No --

271
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,101
I'd come to congratulate you.

272
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:22,836
Would you see that!

273
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,521
I forgot it entirely!

274
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:26,869
Promise me

275
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,394
That you'll stay here until Sunday.

276
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,054
I promise.

277
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:34,661
I won't go even if someone took me away.

278
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:37,174
I'll take you along when I go shopping.

279
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:38,884
Sure.

280
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,988
Mum!

281
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:44,607
Mum!

282
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,307
Are you listening?

283
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:49,923
Farah's getting married this Sunday!

284
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,257
Alright.

285
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,441
God be with ye.

286
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,321
Farah's left?

287
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:29,430
Yes.

288
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,538
What did you say? Who's getting married?

289
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,072
Farah's getting married, Mum.

290
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:36,748
She's getting married this Sunday.

291
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,566
There's no need to smile so broadly.

292
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,256
Where's Uncle?

293
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:50,681
He's watching the news.

294
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,270
And where's your sister?

295
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,286
What's her name --?

296
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,268
Farah Ibrahim?

297
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,704
She's in her room.

298
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,814
Then take me straight to her room.

299
00:21:59,814 --> 00:22:01,096
What?

300
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:06,050
I'll show her today that Sibtain Akhtar Ali is not going to fear any wee lassie out there!

301
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,120
That angry face will be getting a slap.

302
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,751
I'll take it, but will speak my heart out to her face.

303
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:12,830
Put a sock in it!

304
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,323
As if you've got the guts!

305
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:16,634
You --

306
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,257
Just tell me where her room is.

307
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:20,959
The wedding date's been finalised, innit?

308
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,871
I know all of it.

309
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,787
What would you say, then?

310
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,676
I've thought of ten different ways to decline.

311
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:29,551
But your Mum and Dad are overjoyed.

312
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,720
To the dickens with Maw and Paw!

313
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,850
Good Lord!

314
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,178
You're furious!

315
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,209
Nobody's seen my fury yet!

316
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,581
You're under my oath,

317
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:41,328
Show your fury before you leave.

318
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,017
Well, shan, whatever do you want?

319
00:22:49,017 --> 00:22:55,151
There was no danger until the engagement; should I marry her, now?

320
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:57,639
Have you studied science?

321
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:59,901
Then understand it clearly -

322
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:02,794
Marriage is a chemical change.

323
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:09,480
No inducements can bring the substances back to their original states.

324
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,264
Run!

325
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:51,327
Get going.

326
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,079
Now that he's here,

327
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:55,293
He'll be up to more of the same.

328
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:58,873
He's deliberately aimed his shot.

329
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,604
It's me.

330
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,816
Where are you, Monsieur?

331
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:24,338
It's been three days and we haven't the foggiest!

332
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:25,744
I'm in Hyderabad.

333
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,155
But as per the terms of the deal,

334
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:29,978
You cannot leave the town without permission.

335
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:32,022
I just left.

336
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:33,668
What did you leave?

337
00:24:33,668 --> 00:24:35,948
You and your town.

338
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,041
Are you alright?

339
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:41,054
I'm alright, sir.

340
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:43,506
I'm on the streets of my neighbourhood, playing cricket.

341
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:44,444
Surely,

342
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:47,073
You're kidding?

343
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:49,905
I don't know what you understand by 'kidding'.

344
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,709
Look, M. Afzal,

345
00:24:51,709 --> 00:24:53,881
You are needed here.

346
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:57,038
I'm being asked where you are and when you'll be coming.

347
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,724
Tell them I'm not coming.

348
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll be playing cricket on the streets of my neighbourhood,

349
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,789
And live my life with Mum and Dad.

350
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,700
Where are the letters, Arifa?

351
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,075
Which letters?

352
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:56,113
The same

353
00:25:56,113 --> 00:26:00,032
That Farah used to write to him.

354
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,768
They're in Afzal's cupboard.

355
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:05,939
He's kept them safely with him?

356
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,170
Have you read them?

357
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,163
Yes...

358
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,708
Three or four of them.

359
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,004
I will, too.

360
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:27,269
Don't.

361
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,360
It is not proper of you to read them.

362
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,334
Why isn't it?

363
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:33,237
They're not letters, Yasmin,

364
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:36,271
They're chronicles of love.

365
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:39,189
Someone else has written them.

366
00:26:39,189 --> 00:26:40,284
So?

367
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:43,720
Their words will come back to mock you tomorrow if you read them today.

368
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,024
And I will regret it tomorrow, Arifa, if I didn't read them today.

369
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:56,780
I'll never know how much she loves him.

370
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,638
I just want to see

371
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:00,983
If she loves him more than I do.

372
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:02,155
Ask Afzal,

373
00:27:02,155 --> 00:27:03,827
He'd let you read them.

374
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:06,264
He'd never let me read them.

375
00:27:06,264 --> 00:27:11,075
He'd think that I'd feel sad to read them.

376
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,653
Swear to me, then,

377
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:23,310
You won't feel sad.

378
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,232
I'm a girl, Arifa.

379
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:30,387
And girls are the kind who'd beckon to sorrow just like that!

380
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:33,077
How can I swear to you?

381
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,960
Alright,

382
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,814
I'll test my courage.

383
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,945
Girls should not test their courage.

384
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,334
Don't fear.

385
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:09,522
Show me the letters.

386
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:52,810
Over here.

387
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,403
What's the matter?

388
00:28:53,403 --> 00:28:56,340
What is it? Why are you so anxious?

389
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,309
She's in Afzal's room, reading the letters.

390
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,293
'She',

391
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,529
As in Yasmin?

392
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:03,405
Yes.

393
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,794
She's read them?

394
00:29:04,794 --> 00:29:06,872
My heart says she's reading them.

395
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,309
Oh, so it's your heart that's said it.

396
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,129
The news isn't true, so to speak.

397
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,485
Ruqaiyya Subhanallah is my name.

398
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,114
I can read intentions, Molvi Sahab.

399
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:19,872
Alright, you can read intentions...

400
00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:21,935
Then,

401
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:24,834
Pray tell, what is that

402
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,060
Your Afzal is up to?

403
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,810
What is he up to?

404
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,543
Is he talking about going back?

405
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:33,652
When did I say he's talking about going back?

406
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:35,532
You just claimed,

407
00:29:35,532 --> 00:29:37,185
'I can read intentions',

408
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,867
So I thought I'd just as well ask you

409
00:29:39,867 --> 00:29:40,694
What

410
00:29:40,694 --> 00:29:42,616
He would do now.

411
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,538
You're --

412
00:29:44,632 --> 00:29:48,444
You give such a fright, Molvi Sahab.

413
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:51,323
Speaking of which,

414
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,316
Truly, you should fear.

415
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:56,978
He's only been engaged,

416
00:29:56,978 --> 00:30:01,159
And he's sitting with his fiancée before your eyes in his room.

417
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:01,898
This

418
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:03,887
Is not proper.

419
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,187
Which part of it is not proper?

420
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:09,355
And who's ran into his room with his fiancée?

421
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,723
Fear God, Molvi Sahab,

422
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,074
Arifa's with her in the room.

423
00:30:14,074 --> 00:30:17,678
Afzal's gone to meet his friends.

424
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,150
There's no power but God's!

425
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:22,958
Don't exclaim that,

426
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:24,967
Go and knock the door,

427
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:25,553
And

428
00:30:25,553 --> 00:30:27,275
Dissuade her from reading the letters.

429
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:29,233
By the Lord, lady,

430
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,279
Let her read them.

431
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,614
What's the worst that can happen?

432
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:32,538
Oh,

433
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:35,101
You're asking me!

434
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,708
I'd gotten my hands one letter of Fajr's!

435
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:40,808
I remember it line by line to this day,

436
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,999
Just -- what was that song? What were its lyrics --?

437
00:30:43,999 --> 00:30:50,307
'Uhh -- O you who met my gaze and turned away',
-'I have no complaints from you'.

438
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,148
I have told you a hundred times,

439
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:54,756
She'd written this rather sheepishly!

440
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:56,615
Otherwise, unlike your son,

441
00:30:56,615 --> 00:31:01,093
I'm no longer involved in such exchanges of letters! Right?

442
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,435
Who's this Miss Mary?

443
00:31:13,435 --> 00:31:15,534
Miss Mary?

444
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:19,539
This letter speaks of a certain Miss Mary.

445
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:22,852
She'd seen Afzal.

446
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:25,383
Seen, as in?

447
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,898
Outside the school.

448
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,123
Wow!

449
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,484
This is love from good old childhood days, Arifa.

450
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:36,827
It's been going on since schooldays.

451
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:40,720
That's enough, put these letters away.

452
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,142
Don't read any further.

453
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:44,142
Take all the letters except this one.

454
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:46,019
I'll keep this one with me.

455
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,049
Why?

456
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:48,690
What'd you do with it?

457
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,351
Just --

458
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:55,846
It feels as if there's something in this letter.

459
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,347
Don't worry.

460
00:31:57,347 --> 00:31:59,501
I'm not keeping it forever.

461
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,040
I'll give it back to you in a couple of days.

462
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,701
Where are you going?

463
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:06,557
To your room.

464
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,316
I'll read it a few times,

465
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:09,940
Research over it,

466
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,095
And you'll see,

467
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,923
I'll dig up something interesting!

468
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,546
It's not about the elephant, Monseigneur,

469
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,267
But about the scallywag.

470
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:34,094
He's afraid of sitting on an elephant.

471
00:32:34,094 --> 00:32:38,173
Gone are the days, Monsieur, when grooms would ride an elephant.

472
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:40,048
Just have him ride a horse.

473
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:41,452
I said the same to him,

474
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:44,109
But he flared up at the mention of a horse.

475
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:44,909
He says,

476
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:46,453
'I don't trust it'!

477
00:32:46,453 --> 00:32:50,377
'Who knows what it could do if it decided to gallop'!

478
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:01,368
Let me talk to Madame.

479
00:33:01,368 --> 00:33:03,690
Sure, I will.

480
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,178
Here. Talk to him.

481
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,609
Hello?

482
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,672
Where's our daughter-in-law?

483
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,311
She's just come back, Monsieur,

484
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:14,829
She'd gone to give her friends

485
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:18,156
From the University cards for her wedding.

486
00:33:18,156 --> 00:33:19,532
Yes.

487
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:21,625
That's alright.

488
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:22,897
Saturday

489
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:23,992
9 p.m.

490
00:33:23,992 --> 00:33:25,464
After the news?

491
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:28,132
Alright, bring the henna.

492
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,470
God be with ye.

493
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:56,624
What's up with you?

494
00:33:56,624 --> 00:33:58,103
What's up?

495
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,978
It appears you've been traumatised.

496
00:33:59,978 --> 00:34:02,432
You're suddenly all worked up!

497
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:04,102
Not at all --

498
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:05,861
No way.

499
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,447
I just -- Thought when I heard of the elephant,

500
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,768
That if he rode an elephant,

501
00:34:09,768 --> 00:34:11,852
Won't it stall all the traffic?

502
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,541
Ah, right.

503
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:15,449
I'd never thought of that.

504
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,342
Leave it be.

505
00:34:16,342 --> 00:34:17,484
Don't think of it.

506
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:19,736
Let him ride an elephant if he wishes to.

507
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:23,415
Whoever cares about the traffic here?

508
00:34:27,884 --> 00:34:29,696
But

509
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:32,945
Why am I anxious, Farah?

510
00:34:34,556 --> 00:34:36,334
What are you anxious about?

511
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,444
Everything's been decided now.

512
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,907
I've agreed, too,

513
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,212
And I'm as firm as a boulder on my intentions.

514
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,142
Why are you anxious, then?

515
00:34:44,142 --> 00:34:45,652
Please, don't be.

516
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,377
I won't step back.

517
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,319
That's the problem!

518
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:51,690
Problem, as in?

519
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,096
I mean, you won't step back.

520
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:58,635
What if he stepped back, though?

521
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,615
I have a hunch, Farah,

522
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:02,889
He'll not be coming.

523
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:05,175
He'll vanish on the wedding day.

524
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,472
I'm feeling the same.

525
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:10,558
It must've burnt right through him, this news.

526
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,885
That's what I want, too.

527
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:15,213
He should burn in agony for one day.

528
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,902
He may vanish, then, if he wants!

529
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:18,903
Grab his sweet Yasmin's hand quietly,

530
00:35:18,903 --> 00:35:20,549
And leave for Karachi.

531
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,028
You're talking about Afzal?

532
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:24,517
Obviously.

533
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:27,326
I'm talking about Sibtain Akhtar Ali, Sherlock!

534
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,715
What?

535
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:31,217
So you think he'll vanish on the wedding day?

536
00:35:31,217 --> 00:35:31,903
Yes.

537
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:33,636
That's what I feel.

538
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:39,109
Dad will throw him under the elephant's foot and kill him!

539
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,694
Look,

540
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,960
I can't exactly tell you, Farah,

541
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,741
But he doesn't want to marry you.

542
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:50,107
He doesn't want to marry me?

543
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,398
That blighter, the twopenny-halfpenny psychiatrist?

544
00:35:52,398 --> 00:35:53,516
No.

545
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:55,131
I don't believe this.

546
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,054
He loves me!

547
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,584
He doesn't love you, Farah.

548
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:01,279
You're saying that

549
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:03,617
As if you've gotten your hands on his diary,

550
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:06,898
Or you've caught him red-handed.

551
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,171
Alright, tell me,

552
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,958
If he doesn't love me,

553
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,375
Whom does he love?

554
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,726
Do you, by any chance, fear God at all?

555
00:36:14,726 --> 00:36:17,002
Sibtain's Mum and Dad will be downstairs any moment,

556
00:36:17,002 --> 00:36:19,711
And you're up with this quiz game up here.

557
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,820
Pray tell,

558
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,587
Who loves whom?

559
00:36:22,587 --> 00:36:24,307
Are you talking about Salman Khan?

560
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,431
Or Aamir Khan?

561
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,274
Irrfan Khan.

562
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:29,290
There!

563
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,305
Now is that too big for his boots!

564
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:33,977
That twit's into these affaires de cœur!

565
00:36:33,977 --> 00:36:35,054
Anyway,

566
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,086
You can tell me with whom later.

567
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:40,086
For now, come downstairs.

568
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:42,189
This Irrfan Khan is the same, isn't he,

569
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:43,155
Spindly,

570
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:43,905
Dark-complexioned,

571
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,906
Puffy-eyed?

572
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:10,427
Afzal, just tell me one thing, mate,

573
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:13,443
Does she no longer write you letters?

574
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:14,929
I mean,

575
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:17,474
You haven't read out a new one for seven months.

576
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:20,459
I've gotten engaged, mate.

577
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,067
She won't write me anything now.

578
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,010
You got engaged just a few days ago.

579
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,881
I'm talking about the time before the engagement.

580
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:27,836
Leave it, mate.

581
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:30,194
I've gotten engaged, intentions changed,

582
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:33,524
Just think that the girl who used to write letters has changed, too.
-The bugger's lying.

583
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:36,822
You're afraid of Yasmin, aren't you?

584
00:37:36,822 --> 00:37:38,832
Yes.

585
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:43,305
I'm afraid of everyone who loves me, Babloo.

586
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,810
Very afraid.

587
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,226
This fear has brought me back to Hyderabad.

588
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,389
She loved you too.

589
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:53,509
Weren't you afraid when getting engaged?

590
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:55,571
I didn't.

591
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:56,710
Ask why.

592
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,430
Why?

593
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:02,121
All fear of her had vanished.

594
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:05,153
She was getting engaged on the same day.

595
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:09,281
And now, I've heard she's getting married, too.

596
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:11,906
I'll get going, mate.

597
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:15,921
The call to the night prayer will be heard any moment.

598
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,740
Everything's alright, innit?

599
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,585
Yes.

600
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:35,214
Ev --

601
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,493
Everything's alright.

602
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:40,001
Nothing's alright.

603
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,955
And if something's still alright,

604
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,125
It won't be now.

605
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,219
What happened?

606
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:48,621
She's reading your letters.

607
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:50,777
Letters?

608
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:56,110
Don't ask who gave her.

609
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:01,791
Can Arifa turn down an order of our daughter-in-law's?

610
00:39:02,894 --> 00:39:04,659
Don't look at her.

611
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:05,945
Focus your eyes

612
00:39:05,945 --> 00:39:07,286
On what's to come.

613
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,708
She thought she'd just glance over them and put them back in the cupboard,

614
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,988
But I've heard she's reading them as if

615
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,503
Preparing for an exam.

616
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,932
And she's taken such a liking to one of those letters

617
00:39:17,932 --> 00:39:19,597
That she clenched it in her hand and ran away.

618
00:39:19,597 --> 00:39:21,832
She says she'd 'research' over it.

619
00:39:21,832 --> 00:39:24,144
Where is she?

620
00:39:24,144 --> 00:39:26,852
In my room.

621
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,994
Hey!

622
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:36,105
You don't have the right to go into her room.

623
00:39:36,105 --> 00:39:38,528
She's still an outsider to you.

624
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:41,834
I won't go into her room, Mum.

625
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:46,088
I'll knock on the door and say, 'Give the letter back'.

626
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,552
Yes.

627
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,048
That's fine.

628
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:54,906
But still, take Arifa along.

629
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:56,546
Come.

630
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:58,443
And listen,

631
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,693
Request her.

632
00:40:00,693 --> 00:40:04,586
Don't show your anger, okay?

633
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,830
Alright.

634
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
