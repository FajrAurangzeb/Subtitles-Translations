1
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:13,677
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:18,838
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:24,017
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:30,267
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:35,957
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:40,761
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,627
Have you thought of a name?

8
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,556
What good will that be?

9
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:28,556
Who'll come to meet my family?

10
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,526
Pick one so we know whom to talk to.

11
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,916
Shut up.

12
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,496
What's it to me? I'll shut up.

13
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:35,886
But what'll you do about Mum?

14
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,886
She'll ask you when he's coming the moment you reach home.

15
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,232
I've thought of an answer.

16
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,401
Tell me.

17
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,281
I'll say he's out of town.

18
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,988
He's gone to Karachi.

19
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,051
Right...

20
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,632
That's a fine answer.

21
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:52,044
But then, Dad will ask for his mobile number to talk to him.

22
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,359
I feel like crashing into a wall!

23
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:56,688
If you want to crash into a wall,

24
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,798
Is Mehtab too bad a choice?

25
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,760
Marry him and think as if you've crashed into a wall.

26
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:05,430
Not Karachi.

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,561
America.

28
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,700
Don't drag America into this.

29
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
It's aready got its hands full with its own share of quandaries!

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,820
Try to understand the situation.

31
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,526
I'll say he's gone to America.

32
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,100
He'll be back in a few days.

33
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,459
And if he doesn't come for a few days?

34
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,500
I can find anyone in a few days.

35
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
She'll also ask why you didn't take the driver along.

36
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,310
Think of an answer to that too.

37
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:40,319
It's him, isn't it?

38
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,632
Arifa's brother?

39
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:42,780
You're right...

40
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,300
But what is he doing here?

41
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,789
He should be at the office right now.

42
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,487
He's an A1 loafer.

43
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:53,327
Must've found an excuse to skive off work.

44
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,870
You left the driver here when you left?

45
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,420
I, too, remembered on the way that --

46
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,950
I'd left the driver at home...

47
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,467
You've not mentioned when he'll be coming.

48
00:04:53,606 --> 00:04:55,696
It'll be sometime after the evening.

49
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,926
But he won't come for a couple of days.

50
00:04:57,926 --> 00:04:59,507
Why not?

51
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:02,449
He's -- Out of the country.

52
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,277
Where is he?

53
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,879
I don't know --

54
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,190
He had a few options...

55
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,640
He'll tell me where he went once he's arrived.

56
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,706
At the very least, we can talk over the phone.

57
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:17,716
It'll be alright once your father is satisfied.

58
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,476
He's not slept peacefully all night.

59
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:22,037
Turning from one side to another,

60
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,566
He'd say with visible fear

61
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:24,856
As he glimpsed the gun,

62
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:26,996
'Get this gun off the wall'!

63
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,656
Get it off then...

64
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,566
It's not about the gun.

65
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,876
Your Dad is unsettled.

66
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:36,606
He was asking the boy's name over breakfast.

67
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,099
What could I say?

68
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,617
You've not even told me his name.

69
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:44,767
He was mumbling over it as he smoked his cigar in the morning,

70
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:48,539
Saying repeatedly, 'A boy whose name is unknown to me'

71
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,287
'Is going to become my son-in-law'.

72
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:52,957
It's just a couple of days, Mum...

73
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:55,397
Everybody will come to know who he is.

74
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,176
I -- I'm not hungry at all.

75
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,907
Ask Aunt not to knock on our door.

76
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,486
Wait!

77
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,596
At least tell me his name.

78
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,897
I'll tell your father instantly when he'd ask at night.

79
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:08,286
I'll say, 'Make do with just the name for now',

80
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,096
'You'll get to know the rest later'.

81
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,440
Tell me. What's his name?

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,190
Afzal...

83
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,241
You didn't mention what happened to her...

84
00:06:58,241 --> 00:06:59,617
It's nothing.

85
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:00,948
Nothing?

86
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:04,450
Why is she unconscious for so long if nothing's happened to her?
-It's a shock.

87
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,448
Perhaps she's suddenly heard some news, or...

88
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:08,894
Or?

89
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:13,264
Are you, by any chance, getting her married to someone she doesn't want to marry?

90
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:14,564
You can find this out too?

91
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:16,067
I can't find it out,

92
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:19,346
But I'm a family doctor. This is why I'm asking.

93
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,924
Yes, it was planned...

94
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,680
We'd fixed the date too,

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,317
But then found out she's not happy with it.

96
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,094
What did you do?

97
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,819
That which a good father should do.

98
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,963
I'll call to decline today.

99
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:35,340
Good.

100
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,959
Tell your family not to utter his name before her.

101
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,962
By the way, what's his name?

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,509
Mehtab.

103
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:44,960
What a nice name!

104
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,169
Anyway, she'll come to soon.

105
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,119
Don't meet her before she's stable.

106
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,580
Why?

107
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,753
In such cases, every honourable girl fears her father.

108
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:00,396
Okay.

109
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,296
I won't meet her.

110
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:05,796
Who's this Afzal, Lubna?

111
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,216
What's she asking?

112
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:14,876
She's asking who Afzal is.

113
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:18,486
Why is she asking instead of telling?

114
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,296
The truth is

115
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,516
It's gotten into her mind

116
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,216
That I didn't mention his full name

117
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,577
Is Afzal not his full name?

118
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:40,066
No.

119
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,606
In fact, Afzal isn't his name at all.

120
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,489
I meant --

121
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,877
'Afzal'

122
00:08:45,877 --> 00:08:47,706
'As in the best'.

123
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:49,676
What do you mean?

124
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,516
I'm not talking about his name.

125
00:08:51,516 --> 00:08:53,986
I meant his character.

126
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,696
He's the best in character.

127
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,846
There's no one like him, so to say!

128
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,647
Anyway...

129
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,737
I can understand that.

130
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,689
By God, I thought for a while

131
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,461
You're talking about Molvi Subhanallah's son.

132
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,619
God forgive!

133
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:22,733
God is the Greatest

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,070
Farah!

135
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,130
Farah, wake up!

136
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,119
Get up! Mum's left!

137
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,390
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you...

138
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:30,758
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you...

139
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,980
God forgive all my sins...

140
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:31,610
O our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the hell fire.

141
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,706
Who's this Afzal?

142
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:49,906
That blighter?

143
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,957
Molvi Subhanallah's son?

144
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,757
The loafer, the vagrant!

145
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:57,335
You named him and said I love him!

146
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:59,546
That's what you think about me!

147
00:11:59,546 --> 00:12:02,698
You thought you'd name someone like that,

148
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,316
And I'd stay quiet!

149
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:06,116
Just because I'm in the soup?

150
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,306
To the dickens with it!

151
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:10,476
It's better that I'm in the soup

152
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,657
Than out of it with the help of that loafer extraordinaire!

153
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:14,726
But if you mention his name again,

154
00:12:14,726 --> 00:12:17,046
I'll claw your face apart!

155
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,087
Listen to me, Farah.

156
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:21,556
I changed my statement.

157
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:26,204
Mum, too, had thought I was talking about Molvi Subhanallah's son.

158
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,314
So?

159
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,264
Who were you talking about?

160
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:31,494
I was saying that he had the best character.

161
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:34,904
Unrivalled and unlike any other!

162
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,259
Oh my God...

163
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,134
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,790
I'm so wicked, am I not?

165
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,910
I slapped you so hard...

166
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,140
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,300
Please...

168
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,766
Hey!

169
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,017
What took you so long?

170
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:19,366
Greetings, Mum!

171
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,839
That's great!

172
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,285
You've finished your lunch.

173
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,119
Hold on.

174
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:34,590
What's the matter?

175
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,844
Why aren't you saying anything?

176
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,591
We'd asked you to become a good man.

177
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:43,252
Don't become so good that we start fearing you.

178
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,790
I'm going to look for my degrees and certificates.

179
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:47,672
I don't know where I kept them.

180
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:49,653
Why do you need them now?

181
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,272
I've gotten a job on Dad's recommendation,

182
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:55,945
But that can't prove I've earned a BA.

183
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,145
Oh...

184
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:00,162
May I go and look for them now?

185
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:01,919
Don't.

186
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,309
All those documents are in Dad's cupboard.

187
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:06,119
I'll get you those in a short while.

188
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,890
Get me some tea.

189
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,370
Right away!

190
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:07,796
Come, Monseigneur. It's time for the 9 p.m. news bulletin.

191
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,396
I know.

192
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:11,386
Switch it off, will you?

193
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,357
What's the matter, Monseigneur?

194
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,637
Something bothering you?

195
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:28,796
Nothing wrong as such,

196
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:32,426
But it weighs on my heart to remember whatever's been said...

197
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,156
She's come to now.

198
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,966
She's had her dinner.

199
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,924
If you have any suspicions or fears,

200
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:41,423
Call her and tell her openly.

201
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,190
I'm not talking about her.

202
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,640
Whom are you talking about?

203
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,591
I mean --

204
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,514
Molvi Subhanallah's son...

205
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:50,751
What's his name?

206
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,870
Afzal?

207
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,151
Yes, Afzal.

208
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,131
No.

209
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:55,631
It's not like that.

210
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,981
Even I'd thought she was talking about that Afzal.

211
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:01,290
But found out later that that

212
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,310
Was a remark about his character.

213
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,297
I'm talking about his character too.

214
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:12,005
I found out today that he was harassing our Accounts Officer.

215
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:16,640
Thumbed a lift from her and tried to assault her in her car!

216
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
The blighter!

217
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,971
Look at him!

218
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,067
This is what the son of a priest is doing!

219
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:25,459
I say, throw him out!

220
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:27,022
I did.

221
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,933
But I'm regretting it.

222
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,942
Is this something you should regret?

223
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,631
Feel good

224
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,329
For you did the right thing.

225
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,990
If Molvi Sahab's reputation is the cause of your regret,

226
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,491
Say to him the moment you meet him,

227
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,608
'This is what your son is like'!

228
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:45,180
That's not what he's like.

229
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,570
I have a feeling now that that's not what he's like.

230
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,499
I've seen that type.

231
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,251
No one like that

232
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:57,532
Speaks before his boss with such firmness.

233
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:02,301
Nor kicks away a job he got mere days before and says, 'Please tell my father'.

234
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:06,569
'I, too, want to see how much my father distrusts me'.

235
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:08,708
I've asked about that girl.

236
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:15,378
Just 15 minutes ago, I got news that she was having dinner with Chengezi at a restaurant.

237
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:18,828
Chengezi is my Chief Accountant.

238
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:21,018
He's the one who'd issued the memo to him.

239
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:24,728
If that's so, why don't you reinstate him?

240
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,809
I would, but I have to know if he will come back.

241
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,006
I don't think so.

242
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:50,964
This is your BA degree,

243
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,939
Your FA [A-Level] certificate,

244
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:01,530
And this one's for your matric [GCSEs],

245
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,149
And your character certificate.

246
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,700
Shall I massage your head?

247
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,411
No.

248
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:14,161
Not today.

249
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:15,741
Why not?

250
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,380
It's this massage

251
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,971
That's got your grey cells working!

252
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:22,334
I need just so much grey cells to work

253
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:25,600
For me to go on like I am.

254
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,839
You're vexed because you're a clerk?

255
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,760
Don't be.

256
00:19:39,226 --> 00:19:42,236
Great men have such beginnings.

257
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,627
Do you know about what Abraham Lincoln was?

258
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:47,457
Or what Edison used to do?

259
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:50,427
Talk about me, Arifa.

260
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:54,456
I'll never become a great man.

261
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,087
So Hazrat Sahab used to tell a lie?

262
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,843
Mum tells me

263
00:19:59,843 --> 00:20:02,520
Hazrat Sahab would seat you in his lap.

264
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,939
And say, 'You'll see, Subhanallah',

265
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:09,119
'He'll grow to become a great man one day'!

266
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,240
Don't laugh like that.

267
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,594
Hazrat Sahab didn't tell a lie.

268
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:20,622
It's gotten into you that you can never become a great man.

269
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,459
Who's this Afzal?

270
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:26,926
That blighter?

271
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:28,986
Molvi Subhanallah's son?

272
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:30,646
The loafer, the vagrant!

273
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:34,216
You named him and said I love him!

274
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,936
That's what you think about me!

275
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:44,920
You thought you'd name someone like that,

276
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,640
And I'd stay quiet!

277
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,470
Just because I'm in the soup?

278
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,459
To the dickens with it!

279
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:52,680
It's better that I'm in the soup

280
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,430
Than out of it with the help of that loafer extraordinaire! But if you mention his name again, I'll claw your face apart!

281
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,330
Who is it?

282
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,369
You're still angry with me?

283
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,300
Okay.

284
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,460
How about you slap me?

285
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,647
Leave that be. What's this?

286
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:44,130
Slap my elder sister?

287
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,730
The one I've taken is enough.

288
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,759
There, now.

289
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,139
Sorry.

290
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,269
I promise. I won't ever slap you again.

291
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:54,159
Leave that be, Farah.

292
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,729
Just tell me

293
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:57,869
Why do you despise Afzal so much?

294
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,630
I don't despise Afzal.

295
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,649
Who is he?

296
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:02,660
He's my best friend's elder brother.

297
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,460
And you know how nice she is.

298
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,769
I also know

299
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,903
That Molvi Sahab is a good man.

300
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:11,022
But what is he?

301
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:15,290
How can the two of us judge what someone is like?

302
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,540
You'll scold me now

303
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
That I'm naming him.

304
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,250
But please, try not to.

305
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,693
Tell me, logically speaking,

306
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,289
How can we know what someone's like

307
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,819
Or what one's like based on what you say, when we hear about them?

308
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,789
I have a simple logic.

309
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,006
He's nobody for me.

310
00:23:30,006 --> 00:23:30,986
Yes,

311
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,237
I found out two days ago

312
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:34,486
That he works at our mill.

313
00:23:34,486 --> 00:23:36,286
Alright, he's our employee.

314
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:37,908
A slacker, at that!

315
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:38,826
Don't you remember?

316
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:42,146
He was out in the grounds watching a cricket match during office hours!

317
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,157
He's no longer our employee, Farah.

318
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,296
Dad ousted him.

319
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:50,161
Miss Rosy filed a complaint against him over harassment.

320
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:56,191
Perturbed over it, Dad was out in the courtyard for an hour.

321
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:57,099
Why?

322
00:23:57,099 --> 00:24:00,319
Because he felt after he came home that he wasn't the culprit after all.

323
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,830
He was cursing himself.

324
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,350
Who told you?

325
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:04,957
Mum.

326
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:07,527
She also told me he didn't have his dinner.

327
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:08,937
Then Dad does not know

328
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:12,157
That I saw him come out of Rosy's car with my own eyes.

329
00:24:12,157 --> 00:24:13,707
The poor girl must've given him a lift,

330
00:24:13,707 --> 00:24:18,207
And he'd have thought he's got her head over heels for him.

331
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,214
Yes...

332
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:20,984
That may have caused the accident.

333
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:23,044
She'd have been defending herself.

334
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,394
Please go and tell Dad.

335
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,643
Alright. I will.

336
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:30,053
And please do listen to anything he says.

337
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:34,602
Hey! What'll he say?
-What could a regretful man say?

338
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:36,894
Mum was saying he'd apologise to him

339
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,844
If he could have his way.

340
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,517
And beg forgiveness of Molvi Subhanallah.

341
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:43,596
If that's so, why not ask him to come back?

342
00:24:43,596 --> 00:24:45,304
Reinstate him?

343
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,584
He's not coming back, Farah.

344
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:48,984
Why won't he?

345
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:51,004
He's Molvi Subhanallah's son.

346
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:54,267
Kicked away the job he'd gotten on recommendation.

347
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:55,974
Do you know

348
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,174
When he used to gamble over matches,

349
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:02,774
Arifa would tell me about it.

350
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:05,223
But she never said,

351
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:09,404
'My brother is the type who cannot respect a woman's honour'.

352
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:11,044
I asked once

353
00:25:11,044 --> 00:25:13,053
That he must have someone he loves.

354
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,553
She said, 'He must be having someone',

355
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:19,526
'But never tells anyone her name'.

356
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:37,550
Where's he gone?

357
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,000
To meet his friends?

358
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,400
He'll just have a chat and come back after a 'See you'.

359
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,479
When will he be back?

360
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,770
Before you go to bed.

361
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:03,496
Meet me somewhere else, my sweeting,

362
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,166
This pauper's presence in this princely concourse is not proper;

363
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:13,691
For souls besotted with love to walk upon

364
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:18,146
These trails etched with the marks of regality is not proper;

365
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:22,526
This meadow on this bank of the Yamuna [holy river], this château

366
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:26,526
These sculptured doors and walls, arches and niches -

367
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:30,166
An Emperor, by the weight of his wealth,

368
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:34,476
Has but made sport of the love of the penurious,

369
00:26:34,476 --> 00:26:35,836
My sweeting,

370
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:38,896
Meet me somewhere else.

371
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,692
No.

372
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,410
I'll not smoke.

373
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,870
I'll have some tea.

374
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,290
Would you look at that!

375
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,119
It's him, isn't it? Arifa's brother?

376
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:42,239
You're right...

377
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:44,119
But what is he doing here?

378
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,099
He's an A1 loafer.

379
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,740
Must've found an excuse to skive off work.

380
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:21,510
It's him!

381
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,080
Who?

382
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,860
Afzal!

383
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:29,921
Stop by the cart.

384
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,760
I'll have some of this roasted corn.

385
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,990
How many?

386
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,150
Get as many as you like!

387
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,879
Look behind us!

388
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:54,969
Is he coming?

389
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,726
Afzal?

390
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes!

391
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,546
No.

392
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:01,036
He will.

393
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,909
Here he comes!

394
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,590
Which way is he going?

395
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,200
Crossing the road over to the other side.

396
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,649
Did you see that?

397
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:19,120
What?
-He's not headed for our office!

398
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,809
Our office is that way.

399
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,918
Listen!

400
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,250
Call him back yourself.

401
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,700
He may come back if you ask him.

402
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,334
Alright, I will call.

403
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:48,731
And if he doesn't, talk to Molvi Sahab in the evening.

404
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:51,340
It'll get this off your heart.

405
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,692
If he doesn't come when I ask him, I'm not talking to Molvi Sahab.

406
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,941
What difference does it make?
-It does make one.

407
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,931
This thing struck me.

408
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:02,791
He'd said it rather confidently,

409
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,860
'Please mention this to my father'.

410
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,130
But now, I don't know what I'd say to his father.

411
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,410
Mr Afzal Subhanallah!

412
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,470
Come.

413
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,230
Afzal...

414
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,180
Subhanallah?

415
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,069
Yes.

416
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,070
Matric [GCSEs]...

417
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,650
FA [A-Levels] and BA...

418
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,810
Third division throughout.

419
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:16,482
But your character certificate is remarkable.

420
00:31:16,482 --> 00:31:18,899
Usually, third division folks...

421
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,119
Aren't so remarkable.

422
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,290
How come you're so good?

423
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,163
Any experience?

424
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:29,409
I've worked two days at Ibrahim Cottons as an accountant.

425
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,273
But the experience wasn't good.

426
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:33,450
For them or for you?

427
00:31:34,164 --> 00:31:35,474
For both of us.

428
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:37,194
Can you speak English?

429
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,140
I can understand what's written.

430
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,089
Speak a little, too.

431
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,950
Narrate the story of the thirsty crow.

432
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:50,890
Sir?

433
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,910
Thirsty crow, my dear chap.

434
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,320
Don't you remember?

435
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,570
'Once upon a time, there was a crow who was very thirsty'.

436
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,414
Do you know English?

437
00:32:00,414 --> 00:32:01,489
What do you mean?

438
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,350
That's what I wanted to say.

439
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,739
'What do you mean'?

440
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:11,980
I'll narrate this one to my friends now,

441
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,488
'There was a crow'

442
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:16,380
'Who was really hungry'.

443
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:40,510
Hello?

444
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,760
Am I talking to Afzal?

445
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,149
Yes?

446
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:44,740
Sheikh Ibrahim here.

447
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,910
Peace be upon you, sir.

448
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,709
And upon you, peace.

449
00:32:48,721 --> 00:32:53,202
Look, my son, I realised later that none of it was your fault.

450
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:56,841
And I regret admonishing you over it.

451
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,989
No, sir.

452
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,914
There's nothing to regret.

453
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:01,009
It's okay.

454
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:04,209
I've called you to ask you to come back.

455
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:06,429
Come and take your place at our office.

456
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:08,069
Thank you, sir.

457
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,520
But forgive me, sir.

458
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,370
It doesn't please me to take up a job on Dad's recommendation.

459
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,080
Perhaps you're --
-No, sir.

460
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,330
No 'perhaps' here.

461
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:23,751
Dad wanted me to get a job so that I could correct my ways.

462
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,613
His desire has been fulfilled.

463
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:27,434
I've corrected my ways.

464
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:29,691
I walk from place to place in search of a job now.

465
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:32,640
It has made me aware of my father's hardships.

466
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,560
And, in all honesty, once one has corrected his ways, he does not take up a job on recommendation.

467
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,550
Thank you very much, sir.

468
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,376
Yes, sir?

469
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,410
How many children do you have?

470
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,710
Three, sir...?

471
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,731
Two sons,

472
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,000
And one daughter.

473
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
What's your daughter's age?

474
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,893
12 years, sir.

475
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:00,681
And Miss Rosy?

476
00:34:00,843 --> 00:34:02,793
How many children does she have?

477
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:03,983
No, sir...

478
00:34:03,983 --> 00:34:05,963
She's not even married.

479
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:10,594
Give Miss Rosy three months' worth of compensation,

480
00:34:10,594 --> 00:34:12,538
And out her.

481
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:13,965
Sir?

482
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:19,765
If you 'Sir' me again over this, I'll issue the same orders for you.

483
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:21,409
Right, sir.

484
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:34,551
Promise me

485
00:35:35,428 --> 00:35:37,928
You'll never mention her again

486
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:41,011
Nor will you ask her name.

487
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:43,258
Just think as if

488
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:45,759
There is no girl.

489
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:48,788
There's no name.

490
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:52,921
Just a dream...

491
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:56,731
That delights me when I imagine it.

492
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,598
And if this isn't acceptable either,

493
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,305
Go and ask for Dad's opinion on it.

494
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:08,311
If delighting myself with a dream is sinful,

495
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,078
I will henceforth not.

496
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,600
Don't go this way.

497
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,641
We head along this route everyday.

498
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:30,131
Turn right, will you?

499
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,361
I know a shortcut.

500
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,699
Right, how's everything?

501
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,089
Fine.

502
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:50,179
Is it time for your break now?

503
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,449
It will be in a couple of minutes...

504
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:54,789
Have your lunch properly.

505
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:56,619
I will.

506
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,039
I've cleaned your room.

507
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,169
Thank you.

508
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:01,489
I

509
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:05,318
Found the key to your cupboard.

510
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:09,502
Key?

511
00:37:10,256 --> 00:37:13,579
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

512
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,285
Where'd you find it?

513
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,645
Don't ask me. I didn't even have to look for it.

514
00:37:19,645 --> 00:37:21,845
That's my treasure in your possession!

515
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:24,738
That is why I stopped short of unlocking it.

516
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:26,074
Stopped?

517
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,345
It occurred to me that I open and read all the letters.

518
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:31,005
But then thought

519
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,486
God is watching.

520
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:33,675
Please

521
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,634
Keep on fearing God.

522
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:40,260
Alright, I'll disconnect.

523
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,066
Have your lunch.

524
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:44,310
I am about to.

525
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:49,647
