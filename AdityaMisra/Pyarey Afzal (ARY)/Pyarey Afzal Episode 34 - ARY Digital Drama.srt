1
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:13,410
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,620
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,241
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:35,630
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,631
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:18,407
Who are you?

8
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,750
What are you looking at?

9
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:33,416
Tell me.

10
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,994
Who are you?

11
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:37,846
Whom do you want to meet?

12
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:41,006
Where do you come from?

13
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,410
Your face looks just like my Afzal's.

14
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,994
But you're not Afzal ['The Great One'].

15
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:00,929
The blighter's on the run, hiding his face from us.

16
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,519
Go away.

17
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,410
Go away -- away!

18
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,530
Get up.

19
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:18,486
I've recognised you.

20
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:26,146
I'm talking to you, remembering only those ties that you left unsevered.

21
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:28,786
You came here to hear about Dad,

22
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:34,206
And you'd left without listening to Dad?

23
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,846
He tripped and fell yesterday

24
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,581
Face-first.

25
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,869
Everyone else saw it yesterday,

26
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:46,040
But I had on that day itself

27
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,729
When you'd dropped him face-first.

28
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,041
His back's hunched now, you twit;

29
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,669
His gait's slowed down.

30
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,030
You left Hyderabad,

31
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,821
He left his priesthood.

32
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,602
You started walking down the path of God,

33
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:13,599
And he came back from the path of God.

34
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,930
Is this the path of God, Afzal?

35
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,842
Does God have one commit murders?

36
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:34,562
Hearing your news,

37
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:39,236
He evades God and starts talking about worldly affairs.

38
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:42,514
Don't say a word about meeting him.

39
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:44,582
Hear it from me,

40
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:48,642
And ask the doctors to satisfy yourself.

41
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:50,422
He's come to now.

42
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:52,712
He's talking,

43
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,562
Smiling,

44
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,672
And eating, now, too.

45
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,264
I'm not leaving without meeting him.

46
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:04,512
And you'd leave once you've met?

47
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,916
Come again the next time

48
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,946
You get the news.

49
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,642
Who's that?

50
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:31,566
Is she with you?

51
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:34,536
There, now!

52
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:37,950
She's Yasmin, isn't she?

53
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:44,706
Come here, will you?

54
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:52,057
Alright now,

55
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,876
That's enough.

56
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,326
However did he chance upon you?

57
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:12,466
He's an ace hoodlum.

58
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:16,716
He may even murder you one day.

59
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:32,681
The blighter had gone to become a great man,

60
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,301
But has come back so low

61
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,876
That I have to search for my son in him.

62
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:41,096
Get aside, will you?

63
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,791
Move aside.

64
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,590
I have to ask your Dad for his judgement on meeting you.

65
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,020
May I come along?

66
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,089
Come.

67
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,712
But don't be too hasty in telling

68
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:05,509
That you're someone to him.

69
00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:35,579
Would you look at

70
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,820
Who's come!

71
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,010
Try to recognise who she is.

72
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,850
She's Yasmin, isn't she?

73
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,730
So you've come to steal all the coconut biscuits!

74
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:00,326
Now,

75
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,546
Will you sit,

76
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,710
Or meet me standing here and leave?

77
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,789
Not at all.

78
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,790
Why would I leave?

79
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,740
I've come here to meet and stay with you.

80
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,190
Did you hear that, Ruqaiyya?

81
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,574
She's

82
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:20,794
Come to stay with us.

83
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,982
Then,

84
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,980
Just stay here with us, will you?

85
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:34,433
He's sitting outside too.

86
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,791
What are your orders for him?

87
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,824
Tell him

88
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:44,004
I'm fine now.

89
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:49,309
He may prepare for his next attack.

90
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,123
He's crying buckets.

91
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:59,380
He says, 'I'm not leaving without meeting him'.

92
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,219
Ties of blood may be stinging him...

93
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:10,877
Our beloved son, Ruqaiyya Begum, is a benefaction bestowed upon us after many ardent prayers.

94
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,959
Whatever he may be like,

95
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,893
He must be in pain.

96
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:22,389
Tell him

97
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:28,150
That he's weeping seven months too late;

98
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,890
We've been weeping for seven months.

99
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,850
Kiss his forehead,

100
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,250
Shower your love on him,

101
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,769
Bless him and bid him goodbye.

102
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:59,883
If the rapscallion came before my eyes,

103
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:05,040
I'll start remembering and missing him again.

104
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:13,040
No, Ruqaiyya Begum,

105
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,339
Please don't take such a risk.

106
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:19,370
And what if he came and fell at your feet?

107
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,209
What would you do?

108
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,679
She's --

109
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,530
She's sitting before me.

110
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:34,949
I can't give him the reply he deserves.

111
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:41,721
Just tell him

112
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:45,471
That he can't meet me...

113
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm actually a doctor,

114
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,180
But trust me, I'm

115
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,405
In a condition worse than any patient's right now.

116
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,740
You must be wondering who I am.

117
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,630
Good question.

118
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,040
Please tell him, would you?

119
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
He's Farah's fiancé.

120
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:57,381
It's -- Alright if you don't think of me as her fiancé.

121
00:12:57,381 --> 00:13:01,301
The engagement didn't fully happen.

122
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,950
It just happened one way.

123
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,910
He didn't put the ring on her...

124
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:16,059
So,

125
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:18,390
You're from Karachi?

126
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,720
Yes.

127
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,346
What do you do?

128
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,221
I mean --

129
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,642
Business, for example.

130
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,710
One can start any kind of business in Karachi.

131
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:37,953
What happened to her?

132
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:39,732
Who?

133
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:41,526
The one who used to write you letters.

134
00:13:41,526 --> 00:13:43,188
Well, you'd obviously be writing her back, too,

135
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,836
But I've heard more about the one who used to write to you.

136
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,476
Still talking, aren't you?

137
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:51,616
Still talking, isn't he?

138
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:52,266
Wh --

139
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,366
Molvi Sahab?

140
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,006
Oh yes,

141
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,896
He's awrite.

142
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:59,017
Everyone's talking to him.

143
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:00,298
Tell me, will you?

144
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,906
What happened to her?

145
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,904
Why are you asking?

146
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,688
Whenever I sit with Farah,

147
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:11,940
We just talk about the two of you.

148
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,989
But I realised, seeing your fiancée today,

149
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:16,639
That you couldn't, so far,

150
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,500
Get the one who used to write you letters.

151
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,289
Someone else got her.

152
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:28,060
That's what happens the first time you love.

153
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,379
Sometimes, you don't get the letter,

154
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,780
And sometimes, you don't get the one who writes them.

155
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,461
Did you see that?

156
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:14,090
How he had her hand in his as he ran up the stairs?

157
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,642
Without the slightest shame, seeing that right I'm before him,

158
00:15:16,642 --> 00:15:20,062
Nor the slightest sorrow that his Dad's had a heart attack!

159
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:22,199
She's his fiancée!

160
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:23,300
The fibster!

161
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,644
The crook!

162
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,150
The ignoble!

163
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,172
Why are you saying such foul words, Farah?

164
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,639
She met you so warmly.

165
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,039
And she's the one who had called to tell you.

166
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,039
However is she a crook and a fibster?

167
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,770
You're envying her, aren't you?

168
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,729
Why would I envy that chit?

169
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:46,871
Did you see her face?

170
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,969
My shoe looks prettier!

171
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,949
Control, Farah, control.

172
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,950
Whatever has happened to you?

173
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,455
Where's Sibtain?

174
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,150
We'd left Sibtain there.

175
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,510
He'll be with Molvi Uncle until the morning.

176
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,950
Why would he stay, now?

177
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,763
Now that that blighter's here!

178
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,230
And he's brought her along too!

179
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,619
Good Lord!

180
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,230
Look at her prance around him

181
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,869
After the engagement!

182
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,940
And she'd even held his hand to show everyone!

183
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,388
Call him!

184
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,527
What do I say?

185
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,083
Tell him to go home.

186
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,687
Let only the one who ought to be there stay.

187
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,909
We'll talk about everything else tomorrow.

188
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,498
What else is there to talk about?

189
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:29,697
I'll see

190
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,017
Who's got the nerve!

191
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:33,107
What are you talking about?

192
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:35,467
I'll call Sibtain and ask him to come here this instant.

193
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,822
You're not well.

194
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,199
Wait.

195
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:39,938
I'm good,

196
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:41,772
But my intentions aren't.

197
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,397
Please, Farah, relax.

198
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,997
It isn't the end of the world if he's gotten engaged.

199
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:47,417
What's an engagement, let him get married.

200
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,917
Whatever is it to you?

201
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,377
That's what I'm saying.

202
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,497
Now that he's gotten engaged,

203
00:16:51,497 --> 00:16:52,907
He'd better get married, too!

204
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,527
Let him fix the same date.

205
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,124
The same date?

206
00:16:56,124 --> 00:16:57,801
As my wedding.

207
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,060
Ask him to get married on the same day, will you?

208
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,610
When are you getting married?

209
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,740
Even your engagement's been stalled.

210
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,402
Just think there will be no engagement now.

211
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:07,879
What do you mean?

212
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,334
Why not?

213
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:12,269
Just try to understand, Lubna.

214
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:14,530
I'm getting married this Sunday.

215
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,423
Which Sunday?

216
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:18,859
Next Sunday.

217
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:29,762
And tell him if you chance upon him tomorrow,

218
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:33,710
I dare him to this one if he's got the guts!

219
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,142
Let him fix the date for the next Sunday.

220
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:39,532
Let me see him get married, too!

221
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,603
He beats you everyday?

222
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:58,812
No.

223
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,071
Sometimes everyday,

224
00:18:00,071 --> 00:18:01,929
And sometimes every second or third day.

225
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:05,234
And you think this induces your nightmares.

226
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,720
The faces

227
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,390
Of the ghosts that haunt you resemble your husband's.

228
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,357
Yes.

229
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,731
Arranged marriage?

230
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:17,510
No.

231
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,001
It was a love marriage.

232
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,962
Oh...

233
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,359
How many years has it been since your marriage?

234
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,354
One and a half.

235
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:31,862
And

236
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:34,552
How long has it been since you've started having nightmares?

237
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:37,431
It's been four months.

238
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,021
Another lass?

239
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,029
I mean --

240
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:46,390
I figure someone's come between the two of you.

241
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,504
There!

242
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:49,250
That's what you think, too?

243
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,420
So is that it?

244
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,000
That's it, Herr Doktor.

245
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,329
I used to say to him,

246
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:54,763
But he never agreed.

247
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:56,049
He'd fight with me,

248
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:57,530
Say foul words,

249
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,389
And claw away the strands of hair --

250
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,969
But your hair look fine.

251
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,084
They don't seem clawed.

252
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:05,113
No...

253
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:07,690
I'm talking about his hair.

254
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,267
That's his style.

255
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:10,509
He'd scream first,

256
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,863
Then hurl abuses,

257
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:15,470
And then start clawing at his hair.

258
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,645
And then?

259
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:17,923
And then he beats me.

260
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,027
Look at this...

261
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,380
Here...

262
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,150
No --

263
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,040
Please don't show me.

264
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,950
Just tell me.

265
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
I already have.

266
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,380
Who's the lass?

267
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,040
That's what I can't find out.

268
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,401
Whenever I name someone,

269
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:32,401
He says, 'She's my sister'.

270
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,980
He may be telling the truth.

271
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,260
How can that be?

272
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,090
He had only one sister when we got married.

273
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,963
Very sad.

274
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,530
He'd be enjoying himself at home, watching TV, while you're suffering.

275
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,339
Not at all.

276
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,960
I've left him at the other doctor.

277
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,589
The other doctor?

278
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,461
You mean another psychiatrist?

279
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:52,620
No.

280
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,462
The usual doctor.

281
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:56,289
One who treats injuries and all.

282
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:57,599
That one.

283
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,309
Injuries and all?

284
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,449
I've hit him on his face with a plate...

285
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,949
There's a little wound here.

286
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,300
Excuse me.

287
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:10,856
Hello?

288
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,216
Farah speaking.

289
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:15,356
My eyes brighten the moment I hear you call out to me;

290
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:19,196
In my mind is associated with your pleasant voice your unforgettable image.

291
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:20,562
Where are you?

292
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:22,086
At my clinic.

293
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,436
Where's Paw?

294
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:24,666
My Paw?

295
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,342
Of course.

296
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:27,936
He's at home.

297
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,546
Tell him to get out of the house,

298
00:20:29,546 --> 00:20:32,246
Come to our place and meet Dad this instance.

299
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:35,246
Is there any problem?

300
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,399
We're getting married on Sunday.

301
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:42,870
Non, Mademoiselle, we're getting engaged on Sunday.

302
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,319
Forget the engagement.

303
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,099
Engagements are for the ignoble!

304
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:49,289
How can that be?

305
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,822
What did you say?

306
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:51,799
I mean --

307
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,479
Why

308
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,560
Are you saying,

309
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,970
'We're getting married on Sunday'?

310
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,069
It struck right at my heart.

311
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,149
This is Farah Ibrahim speaking,

312
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:01,199
Sibtain Akhtar Ali!

313
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,360
Yes -- I know --

314
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,049
I know this --

315
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,459
Very well...

316
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,976
Know, then, that we're getting married on Sunday.

317
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,159
I do exactly as I say.

318
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,330
That's alright, but --

319
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,040
How can we get married so quickly?

320
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,219
One's got to prepare, and

321
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,880
It's Sibtain Akhtar Ali's marriage,

322
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,466
Not a pleb's that it --

323
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,689
It'd just happen.

324
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,250
Know what, Paw had gone to the zoo yesterday.

325
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,581
Why did he go there?

326
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:25,351
To ask about an elephant.

327
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,761
Elephant, as in?

328
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:30,836
Elephant, as in, the large animal with a trunk and having two large tusks --

329
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,000
Jumbo, you know --

330
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,991
It's called an elephant.

331
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,161
So it is; so what?

332
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,621
What'd you do with one?

333
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,978
Paw's thinking

334
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:38,967
I'd ride one

335
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,715
When bringing the procession.

336
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,291
If the wedding procession doesn't get here on Sunday,

337
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,961
You'd better stay at home.

338
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:46,351
Or in your rotten clinic.

339
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,121
And if I see you somewhere after that,

340
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:51,151
I'd whack you with my boot!

341
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,589
This blighter's another one of the watermelons

342
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:08,329
That aren't red on the inside!

343
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,119
Here's your phone.

344
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,990
Easy there.

345
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,840
Right here.

346
00:22:58,046 --> 00:23:00,256
Now, he's

347
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:06,176
Come to an awareness about the difference between righteousness and sin, Ruqaiyya Begum.

348
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,466
He's standing like a stranger

349
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:11,896
Outside his own home.

350
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,896
The blighter!

351
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,416
That's alright.

352
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,786
Alright.

353
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:24,036
Just call him in and ask for once.

354
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:29,336
Hear from his own mouth whether he's among the righteous or the sinful.

355
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:33,514
Surely, your judgement cannot be mistaken, but

356
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,482
It may be mistaken, too.

357
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:38,229
There's no need, now,

358
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,480
To inquire further

359
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,259
Or hear any further explanations.

360
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,880
If he went back now, he may not be coming back.

361
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,121
As if he's come back now!

362
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:58,870
He's sent a murderer in his place.

363
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:09,377
My son has stayed back in Karachi, Monseigneur...

364
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:14,696
Ask her.

365
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,496
Tell me,

366
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:21,197
What was he like when he'd come to Karachi?

367
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:28,700
He'd not kill a cockroach in his room.

368
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,580
He'd just pick it up and leave it outside.

369
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,440
And now, when he started killing,

370
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,720
He killed people...

371
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,050
Have him stand in the witnss box and ask him this.

372
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,080
He must have an answer.

373
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,970
You may not like his answer,

374
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,871
But please, for once, listen to it.

375
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,890
Monseigneur's right,

376
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,590
But --

377
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,580
It's up to you...

378
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,909
I've gone through a full heart attack

379
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,879
Before coming here, Ruqaiyya Begum.

380
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:09,818
I've got the courage!

381
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:14,099
Let him stand with his arms crossed!

382
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,469
Let him accost

383
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:20,309
The father inside me!

384
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,371
But I'm not going to change.

385
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,620
You don't yield.

386
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,980
You just shatter.

387
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,290
What do you mean?

388
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,703
Don't forget, Molvi Sahab,

389
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:40,761
The Molvi has been bitterly defeated in this battle between a Molvi and a father.

390
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:48,620
I have seen with my own eyes the Molvi succumb and fall at the father's feet.

391
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,110
Now,

392
00:26:52,110 --> 00:27:00,003
If you'd grab the father by the throat the moment you've come to,

393
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:05,274
The life will ebb out of a helpless mother.

394
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:10,349
Now, she's being sentimental to blackmail me.

395
00:27:10,349 --> 00:27:12,769
But --
-But nothing, Molvi Sahab.

396
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:15,329
Be blackmailed.

397
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,631
Let him meet his sister and mother,

398
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,689
And when it's your turn,

399
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:22,379
You may look the other way.

400
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:29,439
Monseigneur, his honour has been tainted forever!

401
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,480
He'd regain his lost honour if he set foot inside his home.

402
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
What are you talking about, Monseigneur?

403
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,539
Honour is not a trifle that's lost and won like that.

404
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,979
It is gained on the condition of maintaining integrity

405
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:49,059
And holding firm to all the pieces.

406
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:50,920
Alright.

407
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,840
If that's what pleases you, I'll send him back.

408
00:27:55,367 --> 00:28:00,421
Now, Monseigneur, it isn't exactly something that you should be vexed with me over.

409
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,716
Wait.

410
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,671
Alright.

411
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:09,896
Have it your way.

412
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,172
But think carefully,

413
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:14,806
For you shall be held responsible for it,

414
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:17,526
And any associated sin or reward.

415
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:21,576
No question about any sin or reward arises, Molvi Sahab.

416
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:27,326
If it pleases the mother and daughter, I will cross the bridge to Paradise like the ignis fatuus.

417
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:40,039
Shut the door to my room.

418
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,587
And tell your mother

419
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:47,242
To not let him come here.

420
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,086
Enter your home in the Lord's name.

421
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:28,059
Be wary of your father.

422
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,557
Wary as in,

423
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:32,447
Just visible from afar.

424
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,837
Say the Lord's name.

425
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:10,816
I did.

426
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:12,776
Come in, then.

427
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:42,626
If any of you has the time to, please give me a cup of tea.

428
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,174
Don't look there.

429
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:45,910
He'd gulp

430
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,752
Two cups in his fury.

431
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:50,119
I'll get you in a minute, Dad.

432
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,087
Surely, you can prepare tea?

433
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:55,146
Of course.

434
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:57,106
I make a real tidy brew.

435
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,027
Then, prepare one and take it to Dad.

436
00:30:59,027 --> 00:31:01,037
It'll wash away all his fury.

437
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:03,392
Show me the kitchen.

438
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:04,897
Come.

439
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,468
You're saying Sunday?

440
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:43,439
Yes.

441
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:46,068
You've thought over it carefully?

442
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:48,249
Yes, I have.

443
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:50,970
What date is it on Sunday?

444
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,861
The 27th.

445
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,109
That's what you know, innit?

446
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,386
That Sunday is the 27th?

447
00:31:57,386 --> 00:32:00,886
You're talking about the Sunday on the 27th, right?

448
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:01,997
Yes.

449
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:02,906
Alright.

450
00:32:02,906 --> 00:32:03,917
Brace yourself.

451
00:32:03,917 --> 00:32:06,456
You're getting married on Sunday.

452
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:07,355
There!

453
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:08,542
Your Dad's here too.

454
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,195
Sit down, Madame la mariée.

455
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,538
Where are you off to?

456
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,327
Sit here and try out this bolt of yours,

457
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:15,566
Your Dad tests his heart's mettle.

458
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,286
Why are you folks remembering me and my heart?

459
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:21,916
Please, Monseigneur, sit.

460
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,669
Congratulations.

461
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:30,379
Congratulations?

462
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,659
I mean,

463
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,159
What for?

464
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,050
Farah's getting married on Sunday.

465
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,410
It's her engagement on Sunday.

466
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,284
We'd thought about her engagement,

467
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:45,650
But Mademoiselle's thought about her marriage.

468
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,440
Are you in your senses?

469
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:52,200
Sunday's just around the corner!

470
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,571
You should worry about the corner she's got herself in!

471
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,810
Wait!

472
00:33:02,037 --> 00:33:04,997
Sit here by my side.

473
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:11,624
Right, now, what's the problem?

474
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:14,516
N -- n -- Nothing?

475
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,800
Tell me,

476
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,544
Who mentioned the marriage?

477
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:19,931
She did, Dad.

478
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,133
She got touched in the head back at the hospital,

479
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:26,633
And decided when we got here that she'd get married this Sunday.

480
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,358
This marriage is not possible, Dad.

481
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:38,346
I mean -- Not on this Sunday.

482
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:40,746
And who are you to say that?

483
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:42,546
No, I didn't say that.

484
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,076
Sibtain did.

485
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:47,157
He called and said, 'I'm very upset'.

486
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:48,790
Why is he upset?

487
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,216
He should be delighted.

488
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,887
Perhaps he's -- not ready for so much delight?

489
00:33:55,887 --> 00:33:58,214
There's something else going on, Irsa.

490
00:33:58,214 --> 00:34:00,250
Let it go on if it is!

491
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,136
I say, the date's fixed.

492
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,517
You'd better say, too,

493
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,157
'She'd be getting married this Sunday'.

494
00:34:05,157 --> 00:34:07,002
La fin!

495
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,950
Irsa!

496
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:14,276
Oh God, what is going on?

497
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:16,119
No idea.

498
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:18,036
But I can tell you, Dad,

499
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:21,376
Sibtain won't marry her.

500
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:54,520
Anybody except Afzal may come in.

501
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:59,530
It's you!

502
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:08,286
You've brought tea?

503
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:10,178
Splendid.

504
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:13,966
Working on your first day here?

505
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:16,196
Here.

506
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,580
I really wanted to have a nice brew.

507
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:32,266
You don't seem the type.

508
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,447
What type?

509
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:37,956
I mean,

510
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:41,226
You're so affectionate.

511
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:46,666
But it's rather well-known that you can get furious.

512
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:51,066
Ruqaiyya really says anything!

513
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,726
She didn't say a thing.

514
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:56,896
I've seen for myself.

515
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:00,976
You didn't let him in for an hour and a half,

516
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:05,336
And now, when he's come in, you're meeting everyone except him?

517
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:06,946
Won't it shatter his heart?

518
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:11,456
Do you know how many hearts he left shattered here?

519
00:36:11,456 --> 00:36:15,926
Three of them were ours.

520
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:19,541
Leave Arifa and me,

521
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:23,026
Tell me, if a mother's heart shatters,

522
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:26,497
Whatever would be left there?

523
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:29,567
He's sitting with his head in her lap,

524
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:34,706
And she's running her fingers through his hair continuously.

525
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:38,096
She fears him now.

526
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:42,815
Earlier, she'd whack him at the slightest!

527
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:45,046
Oh!

528
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,899
The blighter's affrighted her, too.

529
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:51,530
You'll see

530
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,035
How she dotes on him now!

531
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:56,929
She would

532
00:36:56,929 --> 00:37:00,289
Be vexed with me for him!

533
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:04,849
She's right like a cauldron.

534
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,240
She'd tilt over to his side

535
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,200
The moment one gets into a row with her sweet child!

536
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,850
In all honesty,

537
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:22,349
I've grown weary of the politics of love.

538
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:27,039
Do you know, this heart attack I had,

539
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,259
This wretched heart

540
00:37:30,259 --> 00:37:35,531
Has belittled me before Ruqaiyya.

541
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,650
You understand what I mean by 'belittled', don't you?

542
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,039
Yes.

543
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:45,760
The same way you've belittled me.

544
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,246
Wait!

545
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,984
Stop!

546
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:56,989
You're vexed with me over the first cup of tea on your first day here!

547
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:02,286
Call his mother's 'Excellent One' [Afzal] here.

548
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:05,076
But tell him

549
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:09,466
He has two minutes.

550
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,334
Hey -- Farah!

551
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:53,617
Where are you off to?

552
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:54,586
W --

553
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:55,679
Where would I go?

554
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,481
It just occurred to me

555
00:38:57,481 --> 00:39:01,922
That I'd never congratulated Yasmin over her engagement because of Molvi Sahab.

556
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,396
If nothing else,

557
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,787
I have a sort of a friendship with her.

558
00:39:05,787 --> 00:39:06,803
Right...

559
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,232
You're chums with her.

560
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:08,926
And

561
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:11,676
I'd give her Molvi Uncle's ring too.

562
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:13,487
I'll say, 'This one was made for you',

563
00:39:13,487 --> 00:39:15,147
'But ended up with me'.

564
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,208
That's it?

565
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,456
That's it, as in?

566
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,436
Won't you congratulate Afzal?

567
00:39:21,436 --> 00:39:22,257
Yes,

568
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:25,890
If he -- came across, I'd -- congratulate him, too.

569
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,600
Splendid!

570
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,566
You have such a big heart!

571
00:39:30,957 --> 00:39:32,677
Are you coming along?

572
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:33,819
No way!

573
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:37,322
I can't witness such spectacles!

574
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,771
Wait -- Listen!

575
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:45,376
Don't mention that --

576
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:47,644
You're getting married on Sunday.

577
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:49,256
Why?

578
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:51,086
Mum will, of course.

579
00:39:51,086 --> 00:39:54,456
Leave such chores to her.

580
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,050
May I come in, Dad?

581
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,270
You have two minutes; that's all you have.

582
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,620
And, for these two minutes,

583
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,466
Stay at an arm's length from me.

584
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,000
