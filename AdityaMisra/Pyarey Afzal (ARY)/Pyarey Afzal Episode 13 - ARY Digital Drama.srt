1
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:14,029
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:18,509
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:24,201
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:30,281
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:36,011
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:40,591
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,240
What'll you wear, Molvi Sahab?

8
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:10,086
You think about it, Ruqaiyya Begum.

9
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,460
I will

10
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,569
Wear the same I did for Bakrid [feast of the sacrifice].

11
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,369
Why that one?

12
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:19,710
Why don't you talk about the other Eid [feast]?

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,649
I'm a believer, Ma'am.

14
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,399
I believe in being the foremost in sacrifice.

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,200
Are you attending a sacrifice ritual?

16
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,329
When

17
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,550
Suspicion mixes with happiness,

18
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:38,230
One should be prepared.

19
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:39,980
Any moment

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,699
May be the moment of the sacrifice.

21
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:44,979
What kind of suspicion?

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,044
Just...

23
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,721
But

24
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:54,891
I believe in God's mercy.

25
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,289
That's why I'm firm.

26
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:04,319
I'm just thinking why Monseigneur Ibrahim didn't call himself.

27
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:09,426
He sent his message; that's how it is.

28
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:11,236
And then,

29
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:13,486
When it's all done and over with,

30
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:17,416
There'll be no need for any calls.

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,980
Pay a visit in person.

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,604
In fact, take him along too.

33
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:26,309
That'll do good to both.

34
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:30,994
You'll get to meet [them],

35
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:34,304
And he'll get to see [her].

36
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,494
I'll never let that be.

37
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,445
We were engaged for four years,

38
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:43,834
And Dad had ordered that Subhanallah not pass through our street!

39
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,745
This here...

40
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,385
Are you getting even or

41
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:52,244
Guarding the tradition?

42
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,999
Whatever you think it is.

43
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,071
But the tradition wasn't wrong, Molvi Sahab.

44
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,496
Dad used to say,

45
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,276
'A gentleman's son should be the bee's knees',

46
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,006
'Not a bumbling bee'!

47
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,557
Have you ever asked me

48
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:11,276
How I spent those four years?

49
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:17,249
Will asking this bring them back?

50
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,814
It's okay.

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,149
They went by.

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,789
You remained over there,

53
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,149
And we over here.

54
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,200
Right...

55
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,220
You've had row with Lubna?

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,185
Why --

57
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,054
Why would I have a row with Lubna?

58
00:03:57,054 --> 00:04:01,284
How did you suddenly feel that you love Farah?

59
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:03,390
Felt as in?

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,685
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

61
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,745
Why would I?

62
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,159
And what would I hide?

63
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,555
You don't love Farah.

64
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:16,767
Alright.

65
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:20,257
So you'd tell me I don't love Farah.

66
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:21,528
Okay.

67
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,535
Then whom do I love?

68
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,210
Lubna.

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,420
Hey!

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,900
For God's sake,

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,040
I haven't even thought of her.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,121
You're lying.

73
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:34,620
I saw it that she was calling you and I answered it once too!

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,650
And I remember well enough what I'd heard.

75
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,810
Not right!

76
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,930
And is it right that you're stuck on Lubna but want to marry Farah?

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,380
Hey -- Ask forgiveness of God, Arifa.

78
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,160
Am I that type?

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,130
That's what one cannot know - what type you are!

80
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,179
Alright.

81
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,119
Swear on my life.

82
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:54,909
Tell me

83
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,879
Farah is the one who used to write you letters, right?

84
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,521
I won't.

85
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,400
There.

86
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,970
You're lying, aren't you?

87
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,659
I don't need to swear on your life to tell the truth!

88
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,839
I'm saying it. Why not accept it as the truth?

89
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,379
Does the sight of cooking alert you too, now?

90
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,890
Poltroon!

91
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:21,832
Clean the dishes thoroughly. Make sure they're dry.

92
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,972
Let me see.

93
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,165
Peace be upon you, Mum.

94
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,946
And upon you, peace.

95
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,465
Lave your face and hands and freshen up.

96
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:33,096
Have your lunch; you won't have time to later.

97
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,926
Are we expecting guests?

98
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,085
What are you asking, Mum?

99
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,990
Think about what I'm asking.

100
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,797
Don't you know who's coming?

101
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:45,976
Good Lord, how do I know who's coming?

102
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,166
Would you look at what you're saying!

103
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,586
Servants are like family.

104
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,418
They'll think you change your mind like a chameleon does colours!

105
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:05,331
Will you keep on saying these things or tell me who's coming?

106
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:07,806
Are you out of your mind?

107
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:09,446
The same, again?

108
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,336
I'm just asking

109
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:14,326
Who is to be welcomed like this?

110
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:15,696
Oh God...

111
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,076
Anyway, freshen up; we'll talk later.

112
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,016
Talk about what?

113
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,356
I'm asking you a simple question.

114
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,966
Why are you so hesitant in answering it?

115
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,587
Do I have to tell you his name?

116
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:29,197
I'm not asking his address, after all!
-Remember this, Farah.

117
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:34,817
If you keep on saying these things, I'll grab something and smite my head with it.

118
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,840
Who's coming?

119
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,719
Someone's coming?

120
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,190
Go and check out in the kitchen.

121
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,814
All those cates --

122
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:08,670
The servants, the maid, the cook --

123
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,720
They're all busy with it.

124
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,202
Who could it be?

125
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,420
You tell me.

126
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,030
I've tired of asking Mum.

127
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,150
She's not ready to tell me.

128
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,290
A friend of Dad's, maybe?

129
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,931
No friend of Dad's.

130
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:26,680
Someone we know.

131
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,600
Someone we know will be coming,

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,340
And we haven't the foggiest.

133
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,890
Find out.

134
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,920
Go, Lubna!

135
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,790
Before this fear takes over me.

136
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,851
Don't send me.

137
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:37,683
I'm getting suspicious.

138
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,790
What kind of suspicion?

139
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,560
You're not getting good news.

140
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,260
To the dickens with bad news!

141
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,510
Oh, no way!

142
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,451
Can't be him!

143
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,742
You'd told him not to.

144
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:51,680
So,

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Are you thinking the same thing?

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,883
I'm not thinking,

147
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,230
Just had a thought

148
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,712
That that's what's got you worried.

149
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,090
Let him show such audacity!

150
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,532
I'm going to feed him his teeth!

151
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,760
That's alright.

152
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,990
But what if Molvi Sahab pays a visit?

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,411
But why would it be like that?

154
00:09:11,411 --> 00:09:12,900
He's your employee,

155
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,090
You pay him his salary.

156
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,081
And as per the contract --
-The contract...

157
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,791
Has been terminated.

158
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,541
He's been terminated, too.

159
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,701
I'd texted him,

160
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,892
'Your work is done'.

161
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:28,261
'Meet Lubna and collect your wage-packet'.

162
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:32,221
That rules out Molvi Sahab paying a visit!

163
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,436
Yes.

164
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,236
I'm getting worried for nothing.

165
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,739
Why would he come?

166
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,397
Why would Molvi Sahab come?

167
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:46,056
Why would anyone from his family come?

168
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,064
Who's coming then?

169
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:41,189
I'm going to the barber's.

170
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,880
Alright.

171
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:52,986
I thought

172
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:57,509
When I saw the yellow gown

173
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:59,819
That it'd suit you.

174
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,190
Thank you.

175
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:08,244
Your 'thank you' seems to have more of thankfulness

176
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,744
Than affection.

177
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:17,926
I, too, find more farewells than welcomes in the soirée invitation.

178
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,366
Hold that, Ruqaiyya Begum!

179
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:24,566
What's this twattle on such an auspicious day?

180
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,786
Seek God's counsel on it if you like.

181
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:30,453
I already have.

182
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,263
The signs are very favourable.

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,151
Sit for a while.

184
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:40,883
Okay.

185
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,627
Right here.

186
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:50,006
How could the signs be favourable?

187
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,169
The girl has changed here.

188
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:53,917
What?

189
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,526
She's not the one

190
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:57,619
Who used to write him letters.

191
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:58,966
Oh?

192
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,330
But what difference does that make?

193
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,934
Does saying your afternoon prayers at daybreak make a difference?

194
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,290
Fear God, Ruqaiyya Begum!

195
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,920
You're mixing up everything!

196
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,369
It is also required of you to fear God.

197
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:18,140
Do not blaspheme against love by calling this good.

198
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,080
The same condition applies here:

199
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,619
You must honour your love

200
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,090
For the one you love, or you are a sinner.

201
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,719
Ask him

202
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,749
If his lover and his betrothed are not one and the same, say to him,

203
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,560
'Your mother ordains a judgement against you'

204
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,560
'That you cannot live under the same roof as the faithful'.

205
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,966
Good Lord!

206
00:12:48,966 --> 00:12:50,248
It's not just Mum,

207
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,566
Even the maids won't tell!

208
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,136
When I asked Sakina Mai,

209
00:12:54,136 --> 00:12:55,736
Do you know how she stared at me?

210
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,566
As if I've said something outrageous!

211
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,997
Something's cooking...

212
00:13:06,428 --> 00:13:08,127
Call Afzal!

213
00:13:09,384 --> 00:13:10,404
So simple!

214
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:11,744
Why couldn't you think of it earlier?

215
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,247
Give me your phone.

216
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:14,774
It's over there.

217
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:22,776
The two of you are sitting as if you really don't know a thing.

218
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:23,806
My dear,

219
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:26,916
Marriage is a serious affair.

220
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,426
The girl's family has to show some fine conduct.

221
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,866
Show whom?

222
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,116
You'd better not say anything.

223
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:37,456
If only I could know when you're earnestly being reasonable!

224
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,566
And you!

225
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,446
I'll have a good look at you after they've left.

226
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,146
After who's left?

227
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,866
I'll whack you so hard!

228
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,629
What are the two of you wearing today?

229
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,966
What are we-- ?

230
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:51,709
Anyway.

231
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,790
Wear whatever you like.

232
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,650
It's 6 right now.

233
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,870
Yes...

234
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,942
You ought to be ready by 8.30 sharp.

235
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:03,010
Get ready for what?

236
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,540
You will come down instantly.

237
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,621
And she'll come when she's called.

238
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,663
And remember:

239
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,500
Nobody should hear you or see your face

240
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,460
Before you're called.

241
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,260
Are you listening?

242
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,177
Yes.

243
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,727
I'm listening.

244
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:20,897
And lower your gaze

245
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,937
As you come downstairs.

246
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:24,507
If they ask you two questions,

247
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,397
Answer one [don't speak too much].

248
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:30,449
And your coyness should be visible when you answer.

249
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:31,547
And yes,

250
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,807
You wouldn't happen to remember the third pious declaration, would you?

251
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:40,507
I do, Mum.
-Recite it if they ask you to; it'll do good to your father's honour.

252
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,269
Recite the third pious declaration.

253
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:52,799
[Recitation]

254
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,549
Try again.

255
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:17,789
Keep on trying

256
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:20,630
Until that blighter answers the phone and talks,

257
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,511
Please, keep on trying!

258
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,790
Now you know who's coming.

259
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,308
Ask Arifa.

260
00:15:48,229 --> 00:15:49,429
Call her.

261
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,620
She'd be praying.

262
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:58,965
Where are you going?

263
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,716
I'll pray too.

264
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,185
Not just the obligatory ones,

265
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:03,855
But 12 additional prayers as well.

266
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,605
Let's see what happens then.
-What'll happen?

267
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,935
The blighter will burst into flames!

268
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:45,846
Listen.

269
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,122
Yes?

270
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:53,226
Tell your mother

271
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,070
To wear that yellow gown.

272
00:17:57,264 --> 00:18:01,902
I'll be coming right after the night time prayers.

273
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:03,126
Yes, Dad.

274
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:05,246
And yes,

275
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:07,797
Tell her also

276
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,016
That she need not be concerned about it anymore,

277
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:16,006
For the outcome will be positive.

278
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,266
Positive, as in,

279
00:18:18,266 --> 00:18:21,896
She need not have any doubts.

280
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:26,330
Go.

281
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,833
Do you know now who's coming?

282
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,610
Yes.

283
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,771
Would you care to explain the reason for that act?

284
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:57,561
Act?

285
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,630
Come here.

286
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:09,556
Go on.

287
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:13,126
To be honest, Mum, I think she's bogey.

288
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,476
What bogey?

289
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,104
As they say in the Emerald Isle!

290
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:21,884
Why are you saying it here?

291
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,354
They say it in situations like these.

292
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:27,804
Say, when the girl changes her mind but you don't know why.

293
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:29,305
What's this you're saying?

294
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:31,084
You'd be furious,

295
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,698
But the truth is

296
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:34,678
She's thinking of someone other than Afzal.

297
00:19:34,678 --> 00:19:36,288
Who?

298
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:37,878
There's no one!

299
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:41,009
But perhaps she's thinking Afzal's not the right choice either.

300
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:26,566
Which prayer is that?

301
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,859
The night prayer.

302
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,639
Did you offer those 12 additional prayers?

303
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,200
It's been a good while.

304
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,060
Alright, get ready.

305
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,059
They're coming.

306
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,969
And you may be called at any moment.

307
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,659
To the dickens with them!

308
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,919
Won't these two prayers and 12 additional ones do anything?

309
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,219
They would have, but think about it:

310
00:20:42,219 --> 00:20:45,169
Whom are your prayers directed against?

311
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,750
One who offers all five of his and leads others'?

312
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,949
You'll get a bit of your reward and the 12 prayers will be of use later.

313
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:53,139
Didn't you tell Mum?

314
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:54,807
I did tell her,

315
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:58,619
And don't even ask how delira and excira she was about it!

316
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,290
What's the problem then?

317
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,069
Why should I get ready?

318
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,000
Dad's come, too.

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,512
Don't worry about Dad.

320
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,370
Mum will explain to him real quick.

321
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,790
If Dad understood it, it'll be time for a right beating!

322
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,271
Whom will he beat?

323
00:21:12,326 --> 00:21:13,900
Don't ask whom.

324
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,260
Ask whom will he not beat!

325
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,500
It's good for your health

326
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,700
That you get ready in half an hour however you can!

327
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,880
Mum's hand is doing all the talking.

328
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,090
What do you mean?

329
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,130
Now, I've taken a few slaps before.

330
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,567
It's no problem with me.

331
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,977
But you've been deprived of this benediction thus far.

332
00:21:30,977 --> 00:21:33,151
A single slap may prove to be fatal.

333
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,917
And, judging by her intentions,

334
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,507
It seems Mum will not stop at one,

335
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:39,431
She'll not stop until you're battered!

336
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,987
Start in God's name! They're here.

337
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:57,499
Peace be upon you!
-And upon you, peace, mercy, and blessings of God!

338
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,656
As God wills! [praise]

339
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,068
Peace be upon you!
-And upon you, peace, my child.

340
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:02,966
May you live long.

341
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,126
You have

342
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:09,368
Elevated me in stature, Monseigneur Ibrahim.

343
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:13,795
I used to think, like any mother, that my son is a prince.

344
00:22:13,795 --> 00:22:15,625
You have made my dream a reality.

345
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,096
It is our good fortune,

346
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:19,659
That our daughter

347
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,269
Will be married to one from such a noble House.

348
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:23,975
We'll take a good look at ours when we go back,

349
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,798
And see

350
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:28,374
If it is indeed noble.

351
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:30,545
Please, come in.

352
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:34,075
Come.
-In the name of God.

353
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,390
This is Farah's room, isn't it?

354
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,030
Yes.

355
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,779
Where is she?

356
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:50,870
She's getting ready.

357
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,650
Come with me.

358
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,493
You've come here with the proposal, right?

359
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:58,644
No.

360
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:01,850
We were passing by and thought we'd pay a visit.

361
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,727
No way!

362
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:03,970
I know everything.

363
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,111
I'm just asking if you're prepared for everything.

364
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:07,020
Of course.

365
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,930
We are prepared.

366
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,330
Dad doesn't leave anything half-done.

367
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,522
Why are you standing there?

368
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,650
Please, sit down.

369
00:23:17,568 --> 00:23:19,836
But what about that girl

370
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,296
Who used to write letters to Afzal?

371
00:23:23,746 --> 00:23:25,146
What do you mean?

372
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:26,636
You'd told me

373
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:28,808
That Afzal loves a girl

374
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,686
And the two of them have an exchange of letters.

375
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:32,696
Don't you remember?

376
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,526
When I'd asked

377
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:36,556
'Do people still write letters in this day'?

378
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:39,316
And you'd said --
-Is it not Farah?

379
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,616
Farah?

380
00:23:42,307 --> 00:23:43,866
Farah would write a letter?

381
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:45,416
Are you off your nut?

382
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,886
She doesn't write, you muppet,

383
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:48,209
She types.

384
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,306
An SMS, at the most.

385
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:51,757
But don't worry

386
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:53,757
Everything will be alright.

387
00:23:53,757 --> 00:23:55,947
What will be alright?

388
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:59,627
My parents have come to your house.

389
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,189
Is it April Fools' today

390
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:06,148
That you'd say to them, 'You took it seriously? We were just kidding'!

391
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,857
Do you know

392
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:12,047
Mum's wearing a yellow gown after ages.

393
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:13,577
Seeing it, she said,

394
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,884
'This colour won't suit me'!

395
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:17,721
Dad said it would.

396
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,630
And she wore it.

397
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,430
And, about Dad -

398
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,020
He never goes to the barber except on Fridays.

399
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,884
Today's Sunday,

400
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:28,410
But he went today.

401
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,884
Left with a smile on his face,

402
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:35,064
Came back elated.

403
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,254
What were you saying?

404
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,694
No --

405
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:41,414
It's nothing.

406
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,851
So Farah is not that girl?

407
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,553
May I talk to Farah?

408
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:57,011
Sure.

409
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,481
They're calling you downstairs.

410
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:04,791
Tell them we're coming in a few minutes.

411
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,601
They want you to come right now.

412
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,221
We've got to go right now.

413
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:12,301
Come.

414
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:12,349
I'm going downstairs; you've still got time.

415
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,919
Wear something nice.

416
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:21,086
No need to hatch any plots!

417
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:22,986
The tables have turned such

418
00:26:22,986 --> 00:26:25,946
That his pawn will take your king.

419
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:27,524
So please,

420
00:26:27,524 --> 00:26:29,666
Accept your defeat today.

421
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:31,666
And marry him?

422
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,487
No; just get engaged.

423
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:35,617
An engagement can be broken.

424
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:40,007
But don't risk breaking so many hearts today.

425
00:27:17,726 --> 00:27:20,922
Without telling the good lady,

426
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,882
I've brought this gold ring.

427
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,822
If you'd allow me,

428
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,752
May I put it on her after dinner?

429
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:32,144
As it pleases you, Molvi Sahab.

430
00:27:32,642 --> 00:27:34,114
Thank you.

431
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,260
Do me another favour, would you?

432
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,700
Pray tell.

433
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,360
Pinch me a couple of times

434
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,471
Before she comes.

435
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,930
Irsa,

436
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,680
Molvi Sahab has brought a ring for Farah.

437
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:04,269
He's asking if he can put it on her after dinner.

438
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:05,489
Of course,

439
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:07,411
His wish is our command.

440
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,263
Why wait until after dinner? Why not before it?

441
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:15,500
Your wish is my command.

442
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:21,566
Go, my dear.

443
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,176
Bring her here.

444
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:26,986
Right.

445
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:41,609
I thought we'd hidden the two of them from each other for nothing.

446
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:47,040
Once they're engaged, they'd get a reason to have dinner together.

447
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,868
You've come to call me?

448
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:55,069
Yes.

449
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:58,070
Come.
-You're coming like this?

450
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,326
Should I sit in a palanquin?

451
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:02,074
For God's sake, Farah.

452
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,821
At least wear something suited to the occasion.

453
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:06,041
What I'm wearing right now

454
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:09,460
Is far better than their better dresses!

455
00:29:09,507 --> 00:29:10,760
Come.

456
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,170
I've been waiting for this for four hours.

457
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:22,589
There aren't many legal limitations to love.

458
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,319
Peace be upon you.

459
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,230
This is our Farah?

460
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,630
Yes.

461
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:35,200
Praise the Lord!

462
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,820
God ward the evil eye off her!

463
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,478
Monseigneur, I'd asked you

464
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:44,181
To pinch me.

465
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,520
But you forgot to!

466
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,440
Molvi Sahab is just...

467
00:29:51,886 --> 00:29:53,296
Sit down, my dear.

468
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,496
How can she sit down just like that?

469
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:58,546
Won't you embrace me?

470
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,940
Look closely, Molvi Sahab.

471
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,129
My Afzal has become the best one [Afzal] today!

472
00:30:08,129 --> 00:30:10,499
Don't tarry now, Ruqaiyya!

473
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:13,781
Before I wake up from my sleep,

474
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,389
Put this ring on my daughter.

475
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:23,416
Come.

476
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,140
Sit down.

477
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:27,916
We can't wait any longer.

478
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,230
Please, sit.

479
00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:44,559
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah], Molvi Sahab!

480
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,759
You've picked quite the ring.

481
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:52,469
Ask her if she liked it.

482
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,150
Do you like it?

483
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,960
She's just being demure...

484
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,760
No.

485
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:11,841
I'm not being demure.

486
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:15,041
It is with regret that I have to say this,

487
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,496
But no such engagement will take place here

488
00:31:17,496 --> 00:31:20,496
That you are so euphoric about.

489
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,996
It's all because of him!

490
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,936
The truth is

491
00:31:40,096 --> 00:31:44,056
I was about to be married off to one Mehtab.

492
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:46,745
And I didn't like Mehtab one bit.

493
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:49,446
I thought I'd talk to Dad about it,

494
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,816
But couldn't steel myself.

495
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,568
Dad liked him so much then.

496
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:58,456
That's why I feigned love for someone else.

497
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,947
In my haste, I found him,

498
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:01,177
And struck a deal

499
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:03,787
Of 800,000 with him.

500
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:16,589
The deal's no more now.

501
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:18,093
I'd even asked him

502
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,590
Not to bring his parents here.

503
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,280
But I don't know why

504
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,309
He brought you here

505
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,560
Without telling me or asking me about it!

506
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,082
I know

507
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:35,767
A moment's daftness brought me here.

508
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,758
But I'd never thought I'd call you here and decline.

509
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,046
Tell me,

510
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,406
What could I do?

511
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:48,816
And I swear by God, I don't even know your Afzal well enough!

512
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:54,026
Forgive me,

513
00:32:54,026 --> 00:32:57,086
But he's a first rate fraudster.

514
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:59,056
The move he's played

515
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,026
Even after everything was decided

516
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,496
Is one I'll never forgive him for!

517
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:06,666
Forget getting engaged to him,

518
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:10,056
I don't even want to see his face!

519
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,979
I have but

520
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:29,126
One complaint from you, my dear...

521
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:33,790
I didn't ask you to pinch me...

522
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,500
Come, Ruqaiyya.

523
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Tell Madame that under these circumstances,

524
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,740
I won't be able to have dinner...

525
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,190
Let's go.
-Come.

526
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,970
Do not bother, my dear...

527
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:34,860
I would much rather prefer the darkness...

528
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,640
Do not

529
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:43,361
Look at each other tonight.

530
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,090
There are questions in everyone's eyes,

531
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:52,660
But answers in no one's.

532
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:43,436
You didn't even ask him

533
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:45,256
Where he was off to!

534
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:48,826
Where could the poor lad go?

535
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:54,011
He's got the answers to your questions;

536
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,479
He's just hiding from you.

537
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:00,390
He must be thinking he'd come back

538
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,960
When Mum and Dad are asleep.

539
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,520
As if we could we fall asleep tonight!

540
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,019
I've

541
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,632
Seen to it.

542
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:17,264
First bought a ring for his bride,

543
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:20,699
And then, sleeping pills for myself.

544
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:27,689
You'd known it all along?

545
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:30,000
I'd known nothing!

546
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,030
But I'd known so much

547
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,000
That the thrill of gladness wouldn't let us sleep!

548
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:39,309
Here.

549
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,510
Take one

550
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,390
And give me one.

551
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,180
I would never take one!

552
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,000
I'll sit and writhe in pain all night.

553
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,439
Oh?

554
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,839
Alright.

555
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,899
Then,

556
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:55,399
Wake me up at daybreak.

557
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,410
If you run away from woe, Molvi Sahab,

558
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,249
You'll find him at your doorstep in the morning!

559
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:03,170
We shall see in the morning.

560
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,060
If he shows up uninvited,

561
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,179
He can't meet us when he pleases!

562
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,309
I'll meet him at my leisure. Right.

563
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,500
Your honour is a bit weak.

564
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,353
No.

565
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,750
My heart is a bit weak.

566
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,496
At the very least, tell me something

567
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,459
That makes me feel that you consider me a friend.

568
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,540
I won't tell you anything,

569
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,359
But I'll torch all her letters today.

570
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,659
She left you?

571
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,380
Here, mate.

572
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,960
Take a puff of this,

573
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,412
Forget all your sorrows and leave her.

574
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:37,729
No. Don't smoke.

575
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:41,111
He who smokes away his life for one so unfaithful is more animal than man!

576
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,519
Mum and Dad have been humiliated so much!

577
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:45,379
What do I do about that?

578
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:47,740
Did they go along too?

579
00:38:49,399 --> 00:38:52,300
Apologise to your parents --

580
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,929
Apologise again?

581
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:57,511
I ask forgiveness of Dad every other day, and that's enough!

582
00:38:57,511 --> 00:39:00,420
There's nothing wrong about it, mate.

583
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,190
It's your duty that you apologise,

584
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,051
And theirs that they forgive.

585
00:39:06,051 --> 00:39:08,111
To be truthful, parents

586
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,360
Do God's work in their old age.

587
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,331
That's what He does, too.

588
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,483
His creation makes mistakes,

589
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,091
And He forgives.

590
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,551
Mum thinks I'm 'Afzal' [the most excellent].

591
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,380
But I've realised today I'm the most depraved.

592
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,847
She'd not have slept!

593
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:32,696
She will, once you set foot in the house.

594
00:39:32,696 --> 00:39:34,536
Won't she be furious?

595
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:38,106
Won't she ask, 'Why did you take your father there'?

596
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:39,588
Why did you take him?

597
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:42,386
Didn't you know she'd decline?

598
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,253
What could I do, Sajid?

599
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:50,530
One has to be untrue if one's heart is untrue.

600
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,080
There wouldn't have been any mention of it had my parents not gone there,

601
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:57,549
And had there been no mention of it, how would I have known that all her letters were but lies?

602
00:39:57,549 --> 00:39:59,449
Who declined the proposal?

603
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:02,282
Was it her or her parents?

604
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:04,829
She did.

605
00:40:05,229 --> 00:40:08,969
So did she write all those letters to get her nib working?

606
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:12,109
Just say it openly that she's turned out to be unfaithful.

607
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,669
She can't be.

608
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:16,341
She used to write him letters twice every week.

609
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:18,733
How can she be unfaithful?

610
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,249
I get it.

611
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,540
Her parents must not have agreed to it.

612
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,369
And convinced her, too, for the sake of her parents,

613
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:30,059
With a fair bit of begging and praying.

614
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:32,499
There's not a bit of perfidy in this.

615
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:37,169
When a girl listens to her parents, she just declines.

616
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:39,090
It's nothing new.

617
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:44,120
More than 50% love stories end when the parents beg before their children.

618
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,481
But I'm glad to hear this.

619
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,109
Let me say this straight, Afzal,

620
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:51,200
What could a girl respect you,

621
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,109
If she does not respect her parents' honour?

622
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:54,839
Shut up, mate!

623
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,149
If she had the slightest concern for her parents' honour,

624
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:00,369
She could've just asked her Mum before falling in love,

625
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:01,679
'Should I'?

626
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:05,199
Why must it only strike people later on?

627
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,879
You should forget her too.

628
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,180
Burn the pyre of your love,

629
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,839
And scatter the ashes in the Ganges,

630
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,685
And look towards the Yamuna.

631
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:13,029
Who's Yamuna?

632
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:14,270
You bugger!

633
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,659
The Yamuna is next to the Ganges!

634
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:17,959
And there must be someone beyond the Yamuna.

635
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,679
Can't anyone else in Hyderabad write letters?

636
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,160
You, too, should get out of these exchanges of letters,

637
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,020
And try texting!

638
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,350
The world's speeding up.

639
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,280
Speed up your love, too!

640
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,600
Talk to someone else!

641
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:34,576
There.

642
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:36,827
The bugger's crying now!

643
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
