1
00:00:07,963 --> 00:00:13,780
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,026
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:24,135
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:30,482
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:36,071
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:40,627
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:57,369
Please, have a cup of tea one last time.

8
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,282
One last time?

9
00:01:59,282 --> 00:02:01,721
Who knows whether you'd ever come again...

10
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,927
I'd happily serve you if you come again.

11
00:02:03,927 --> 00:02:05,069
But today,

12
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:08,928
It'll be the last time from my side.

13
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:13,615
I'd said

14
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:17,322
That I've become the type who'd shatter glass utensils at the slightest provocation, hadn't I?

15
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:21,818
But you hadn't said that you shatter hearts.

16
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,747
But what good is it, now that it's been broken...

17
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,937
Glass utensils

18
00:02:27,937 --> 00:02:30,952
If not a heart...

19
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,610
Are you coming or leaving?

20
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,777
I'd leave after having tea.

21
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:18,525
I'm sure you would have;

22
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,393
Aye, you'd be busy mending it afterwards.

23
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,684
And to be honest,

24
00:03:22,684 --> 00:03:25,676
You did break his face, which made him leave,

25
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:29,598
And you're busy putting it together.

26
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:33,120
But you don't know, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

27
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,690
They say a gentleman's face, when broken, can be mended,

28
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,366
But not the honour that shattered with it.

29
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,640
I know what you're thinking.

30
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:53,068
Aye, you'd know it very well.

31
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:56,711
I'm thinking about that blighter Sibtain.

32
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,486
No.

33
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:03,065
You're thinking why you broke Afzal's face in the first place,

34
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,118
And even if you had,

35
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:09,501
You shouldn't have shattered his honour.

36
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,744
So he tells you everything?

37
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:18,823
Who?

38
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:20,735
The blighter Sibtain, of course!

39
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:21,862
No.

40
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,502
These psychiatrists are very professional.

41
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:28,317
They don't share what their patients' say with anyone else.

42
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:30,050
Give me his number.

43
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,779
Leave it be, will you, Farah.

44
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,573
It doesn't look proper.

45
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,711
What'd Dad think if you met him twice in one day?

46
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,575
Who told you I'm calling him to meet him?

47
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:41,047
Then?

48
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,151
Oh...

49
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,718
You feel like having a chat?

50
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,755
Aww...

51
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:48,986
That's so sweet.

52
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,948
Alright,

53
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:53,736
Here.

54
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:55,884
Call him using my phone.

55
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,761
Yes, Lubna?

56
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,230
Monsieur 'Lubna',

57
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,344
It's Farah here!

58
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,490
Hold on -- Wait.

59
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,665
I'm coming over.

60
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,381
Where are you coming?

61
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,004
I don't think you're well -- You just called me 'Monsieur Lubna'.

62
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,432
This is a case of complete memory loss.

63
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,346
If you set foot in this house again,

64
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:28,327
I'd break your legs!

65
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:30,113
Listen,

66
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,073
I have to say this is very insulting,

67
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:32,848
But --

68
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:38,012
It happens in my profession, so --
-To the dickens with your profession!

69
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,126
If you dropped in here again,

70
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:41,985
I'll make sure you drop dead!

71
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:43,037
Never forget,

72
00:05:43,037 --> 00:05:44,794
My name's Farah Ibrahim.

73
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,936
I'll hurl such insults that - forget about you -

74
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:50,905
Nobody in your profession would ever have heard!

75
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,457
Are there six of them?

76
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:26,291
No.

77
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,620
There's 4 gunmen with him.

78
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,498
They guard him.

79
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,459
Call him downstairs.

80
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,206
Why did you have him wait upstairs?

81
00:06:35,206 --> 00:06:37,055
I've seen it in films

82
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,464
That one is taken to old places he's forgotten

83
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:43,183
When his memory gets lost.

84
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm trying the same.

85
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,408
I'm not talking about fleeing,

86
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:08,596
But about fighting.

87
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,656
Don't think of doing anything stupid; you have little time,

88
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:12,536
Get up.

89
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,545
And leave this place. Get up.

90
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,271
I'll flee on one condition.

91
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:18,510
Go on.

92
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,637
Quickly.

93
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,571
If I run away,

94
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,292
You'd fight them.

95
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,094
Done.

96
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:26,821
Go,

97
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,863
I'll fight them.

98
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,696
Why have you come to Karachi?

99
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:41,042
Looking for a job?

100
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:46,570
To become a great man.

101
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,094
So are you a twopenny-halfpenny man?

102
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:57,556
Nowhere will you find a great man if he's not inside you.

103
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,886
I've given your gunmen their tea.

104
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:14,935
This is for you.

105
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:16,415
Thank you.

106
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:17,621
No...

107
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:19,845
I should be thanking you.

108
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:21,696
You agreed to what I said,

109
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,317
And agreed to have a cup of tea.

110
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:25,080
Thank you.

111
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,030
Please, drink.

112
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:39,092
Looking at this room, it seems that you've left.

113
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:42,004
I clean it everyday,

114
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:47,324
And keep everything just like the two of you would.

115
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:52,829
Surely, you must remember it sometimes?

116
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:53,741
Rem --

117
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,453
Remember what sometimes?

118
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,073
This room,

119
00:08:58,073 --> 00:08:59,663
Babu Hamid,

120
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:02,011
Of course...

121
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:12,028
And you've forgotten to collect your dues of 2,100 Rupees.

122
00:09:12,028 --> 00:09:14,703
You didn't eat anything in the last 7 days of the month.

123
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,716
Collect your dues when you leave.

124
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:17,754
No --

125
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,538
What are you talking about?

126
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,922
I'm talking about the dues.

127
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:26,922
When you paid all of yours, why don't you let me pay mine?

128
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,489
You forgot your bag here.

129
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,312
I took it and had a look the other day.

130
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,382
I found a photo of your Mam and Tad,

131
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,035
A picture of Arifa,

132
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:44,457
And an old mobile.

133
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,628
Don't worry.

134
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,636
I just saw the mobile.

135
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:51,693
I didn't see anything on it.

136
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:54,922
But

137
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:57,811
I saw the picture of your Mam and Tad,

138
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:01,062
And locked Arifa's face firmly in my memory.

139
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:02,236
I'd recognise her immediately

140
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:05,157
If I ever meet her.

141
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:11,185
You'd recognise me, too, if you meet me again, won't you?

142
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:15,439
I mean,

143
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,186
It's possible that we may never meet again...

144
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,953
Or that we meet after years...

145
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:26,818
Promise me, then,

146
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:31,818
If our paths ever crossed, you'd not say, 'I've seen you somewhere'.

147
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,391
Do you know

148
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:37,343
That a second heartbreak

149
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:42,099
Is just as bad as a second heart attack?

150
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,404
I have many precious memories with you, Yasmin;

151
00:10:45,404 --> 00:10:47,982
I can never forget you.

152
00:10:47,982 --> 00:10:49,792
I know that too.

153
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,920
Yasmin isn't the type that could be forgotten.

154
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,074
But why would you remember me?

155
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,486
And if anyone ever saw you remembering, what would you say?

156
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,856
Whatever was Yasmin to you?

157
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:10,552
Tell them, 'She was my landlady'.

158
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:14,289
No.

159
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:18,711
I'd say, 'I liked Yasmin'.

160
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:20,704
You'd recognise me, too, if you meet me again, won't you?

161
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,823
I mean,

162
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:25,994
It's possible that we may never meet again...

163
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:29,952
Or that we meet after years...

164
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,609
Promise me, then,

165
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:38,250
If our paths ever crossed, you'd not say, 'I've seen you somewhere'.

166
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,103
Do you know

167
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:43,055
That a second heartbreak

168
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:48,493
Is just as bad as a second heart attack?

169
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,899
You'd vowed at the shrine, hadn't you,

170
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,123
That you'd come everyday for 7 days?

171
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:09,192
Won't you go today?

172
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:13,369
Why should I go now, when just one day has done the trick?

173
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,547
He said as he left,

174
00:13:15,547 --> 00:13:17,850
'Yasmin, I like you'.

175
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,117
That's it.

176
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:21,901
My wish has been fulfilled.

177
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:39,423
Peace be upon you.

178
00:13:39,423 --> 00:13:41,558
And upon you, peace.

179
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,677
Congratulations.

180
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:52,797
What for?

181
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,372
Sibtain's parents

182
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:56,381
Are landing in Karachi today.

183
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:58,343
I've heard they'll get here tomorrow.

184
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,606
Here, as in, at our place.

185
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:15,683
Have your breakfast.

186
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:18,535
His Dad's a right jolly fellow.

187
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,301
He'd praise the English at length,

188
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,542
And finish with a grand insult.

189
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:27,011
But I felt pity at one thing...

190
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,119
He said, 'You can get anything in Yorkshire, except even half-decent dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice]'.

191
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:33,019
You could've said,

192
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,817
'Our Farah cooks excellent dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice]'.

193
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,729
Hey --

194
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:38,428
I don't know how to cook dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice].

195
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:42,429
Don't worry, I'll teach you everything before your marriage.

196
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:43,911
Excuse me.

197
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,706
Won't you have breakfast?

198
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,267
I've had my breakfast.

199
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:49,138
You haven't even had tea.

200
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,659
I'd have tea at Afzal's place.

201
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:58,372
Afzal -- I mean --

202
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,855
Arifa...

203
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,373
She'd called.

204
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:05,128
She said her Mum's missing me a lot.

205
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:06,942
May I go?

206
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,155
You'd gone the day before yesterday, too,

207
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,168
And you'd told me after getting there that you're at Afzal's place.

208
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,021
Why, sure, go if she's called you.

209
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:15,664
Give her my regards.

210
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,365
Ask how everyone is.

211
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,147
May I go, too?

212
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,313
What'd you do there?

213
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:27,082
What'd you do there?

214
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,020
I mean, just to have a chat...

215
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,458
An outing...

216
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,667
Besides, if she saw both of us, she'd be much happier!

217
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,213
Alright, take her along.

218
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:40,047
After all, Arifa's her friend before she's yours.

219
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,759
Come.

220
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,038
She doesn't seem right.

221
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:54,917
She'll be alright once she's learnt to cook dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice].

222
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:10,170
Who

223
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,149
Got this picture up here?

224
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,817
Had it just been Dad's picture,

225
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:24,691
I'd keep it this close to my heart.

226
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:31,002
But this is a picture of Molvi Subhanallah,

227
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:32,070
The father

228
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,739
Of an Afzal earning his lawful 10,000 Rupees a month.

229
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:41,374
The sight of 98,000 won by gambling in my pocket would torment him.

230
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:44,848
Just think what he'd do if he saw hundreds of millions now.

231
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:48,041
Or, think what I'd do...

232
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,711
And this,

233
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,273
Is the commander

234
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,111
Of Dad's legion of virtue

235
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:56,024
Up in arms against sin.

236
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,330
She'd destroy

237
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,054
Every trace of immorality with one slap.

238
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:11,052
Take this picture off.

239
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:20,082
Otherwise, they'd have their eyes on me,

240
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:24,274
And I won't be able to look into the mirror.

241
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,894
Oh! In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].
-Peace be upon you, Molvi Uncle.

242
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:48,350
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

243
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,386
Over here, Arifa!

244
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:53,801
Both Farah and Lubna have come!

245
00:17:57,263 --> 00:18:00,306
Bring them here, will you?

246
00:18:00,306 --> 00:18:03,810
They've come here to take care of me.

247
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:07,233
She's not ill at all.

248
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:11,498
She's just putting up an act.

249
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:13,935
I've come, too.

250
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:16,935
Seize my hand, too; you'll gain from it.

251
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,713
Come.

252
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,256
Peace be upon you.

253
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:30,698
And upon you, peace.

254
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,657
What'd you do here?

255
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:42,304
You'd said the other day

256
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,098
That when you look at Farah,

257
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:48,914
You see Afzal,

258
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:54,830
So, I thought I'd look at my Afzal for a while, too.

259
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,711
I'd just said it --

260
00:18:58,711 --> 00:19:00,861
So to speak...

261
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,843
She may mind it

262
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,711
If you say it to her face.

263
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,133
No.

264
00:19:06,133 --> 00:19:08,552
I don't mind it.

265
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:11,019
I'm not ill at all.

266
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,230
I'm just putting up an act.

267
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,380
There!

268
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,592
Didn't I say just that?

269
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:21,707
I'd heard it, Molvi Sahab.

270
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,420
Get us some tea.

271
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,436
Come everyday until I get better.

272
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:33,798
Talk over the phone

273
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,498
If you're busy.

274
00:19:35,498 --> 00:19:36,658
No.

275
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:39,036
I'll come everyday.

276
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,819
You're very compassionate.

277
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,444
You have pity on the ill.

278
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,608
No, Aunt.

279
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:49,715
I love you very much.

280
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,830
I love you very much, too.

281
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,939
Did you talk to him?

282
00:20:05,817 --> 00:20:09,000
We saw him on the TV the other day...

283
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,199
He was standing next to a minister.

284
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:19,772
He thinks it was Afzal.
-It was surely Afzal, Ruqaiyya Begum.

285
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:24,455
Granted, I'd only glimpsed him,

286
00:20:24,455 --> 00:20:26,989
But I'm his father.

287
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:32,538
I can recognise him even when he's got his back facing me.

288
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,935
Would you look at that!

289
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:36,711
He's showed himself on TV...

290
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:40,097
But he couldn't show himself around here, at home...

291
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:42,384
He will.

292
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:45,090
He will, one day.

293
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:51,554
You've started thinking like me, now!

294
00:20:55,736 --> 00:20:57,732
Where are you off to?

295
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,275
I

296
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,466
Thought I'd get some snacks to go along with the tea.
-No...

297
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:04,328
There's no need --

298
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:05,732
Let him go.

299
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,146
He was just making an excuse to leave.

300
00:21:08,146 --> 00:21:09,395
Why an excuse?

301
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:12,344
You just said, 'He will come one day'.

302
00:21:12,344 --> 00:21:15,255
It's hurt him.

303
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:16,555
Hey!

304
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:18,298
The homecoming

305
00:21:18,298 --> 00:21:22,100
Of the one whose absence torments him would hurt him?

306
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,803
That's why I'm ill, too.

307
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:31,703
He's pronounced a judgement and declared him a pariah.

308
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:36,463
He torments for his son,

309
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:41,917
But he'd never let a sinner set foot in the house.

310
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,020
So, Farah's getting married?

311
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,135
Hey!

312
00:22:18,135 --> 00:22:20,608
Who told you?

313
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,253
She told me herself the day before yesterday.

314
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:24,906
Would you see that!

315
00:22:24,906 --> 00:22:26,870
Yes...

316
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,138
I'm seeing it all...

317
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:34,654
All the stories are going to end, now, one by one.

318
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,900
I'd write in my diary someday,

319
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,135
'There was one Farah',

320
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:41,188
'My best friend's sister',

321
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:44,156
'And then there was my best friend'.

322
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:48,156
'Who knows where the two of them are, now'...

323
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:55,627
On the page next to it, I'd write,

324
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:58,610
'There was one Afzal',

325
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,225
'My brother, dearer to me than my life';

326
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:06,095
'But his life was not dear to him'.

327
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,795
Nothing will happen to him.

328
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:29,915
He'll come back one day.

329
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:33,833
You'll see,

330
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:38,711
He'll be gambling on matches with the old colony lads, just like old times.

331
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,712
Whom is she marrying?

332
00:23:44,712 --> 00:23:46,088
There's a psychiatrist around here.

333
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,051
She's marrying him.

334
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:53,702
Is he better than Afzal?

335
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:55,612
I mean,

336
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:58,295
He'd be very good...

337
00:23:58,865 --> 00:24:01,542
Does she like him?

338
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,103
The tea's boiling...

339
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:06,315
Right...

340
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:10,997
She had to like him...

341
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:13,146
It was Dad's order

342
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:15,672
'There will be no refusals or obstinacy'.

343
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,257
She, too, figured

344
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,729
That there's no option other than accepting him.

345
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:22,742
When's the wedding?

346
00:24:23,615 --> 00:24:27,482
Judging by the bustle, sometime very soon!

347
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:30,510
I'd known it already.

348
00:24:31,163 --> 00:24:35,752
The day Afzal murdered Wali,

349
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,962
I said,

350
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:41,190
'Farah's out of the picture'.

351
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:18,528
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace, Molvi Sahab.

352
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:19,503
How are you?

353
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:22,191
The Lord has been kind.
-What'd you like?

354
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:24,199
Just

355
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,488
Some of these biscuits,

356
00:25:26,488 --> 00:25:30,105
One fruit cake, and

357
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:33,074
These cake rusks.

358
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,778
Aye, laddie, what are you looking at?

359
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:37,314
Give Molvi Sahab some cold drinks.

360
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:40,208
No, I'm not having any cold drinks.

361
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,625
By the way, you didn't even ask

362
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,067
'How many biscuits', and

363
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,896
'How many cake rusks'?

364
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:46,699
Oh, Molvi Sahab,

365
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,694
I'm having a kilogramme of each packed.

366
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,280
No, my good man...

367
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,651
Not a kilogramme each...

368
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,155
A fourth of a kilogramme each.

369
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:56,568
Leave that to me, Molvi Sahab.

370
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:58,396
Why, good sir?

371
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:00,467
It's what I need,

372
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:04,065
So, it'll be as per my order.

373
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,484
The

374
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,695
Thing is,

375
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:10,951
I've also brought money for just a fourth of a kilogramme each.

376
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,967
Who's asking you for money, Molvi Sahab?

377
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,039
You won't ask for money, old chap?

378
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,841
Why?

379
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,741
Feel at home, Molvi Sahab.

380
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:21,126
Afzal's your son,

381
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,826
He's like a brother to me.

382
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:26,237
Who asks one's brother for payment?

383
00:26:27,347 --> 00:26:30,747
When I was just a trifling father,

384
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:33,318
You'd take the money from me.

385
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,967
You never thought, then,

386
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:40,060
'Who asks one's father for payment'?

387
00:26:41,028 --> 00:26:44,996
Take your biscuits and cake rusks.

388
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:47,717
You've said such

389
00:26:47,717 --> 00:26:51,996
Sinful words in relation to these.

390
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:54,931
Molvi Sahab!

391
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,271
Hey!

392
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:58,037
Hey --

393
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,678
Molvi Sahab's gait has slowed down

394
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,444
Ever since he's run away.

395
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:24,657
He'd have reached the bakery late.

396
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:26,325
You should've stopped him.

397
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:27,905
You let him go for nothing, really...

398
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:29,987
It was necessary that he go.

399
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:34,638
He makes sure to walk 200 steps when he's angry.

400
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,959
Anyway,

401
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,197
Have your tea,

402
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:42,352
And make do with your Aunt's affection.

403
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,417
Would the wedding be fixed directly,

404
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,456
Or is an engagement planned before that?

405
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:52,328
There'll be an engagement before that.

406
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:56,098
Just think that the engagement's this week.

407
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,686
You'd invite us to the engagement, won't you?

408
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:06,843
Or would you skip us, remembering us as hopefuls the first time around?

409
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:07,924
Look,

410
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:11,078
I've forgotten that entirely.

411
00:28:11,989 --> 00:28:14,207
You haven't forgotten it at all.

412
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:17,453
I haven't forgotten it either.

413
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,107
I remember how I gave sorrow,

414
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:24,816
And how you braved through that sorrow.

415
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:26,790
I'd remember that ring

416
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,309
When I'd wear any other ring

417
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,442
That Molvi Uncle had quietly kept in his pocket again.

418
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:45,049
You're under my oath,

419
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,806
Once I'm married, don't bless me;

420
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:51,760
Just remember me and say,

421
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,574
'To you, your way, Farah',

422
00:28:53,574 --> 00:28:56,571
'We forgive you'.

423
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:10,406
I can't sit here any longer today.

424
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:31,931
Hey!

425
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:35,361
You're leaving?

426
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,725
You've had tea, haven't you?

427
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:40,411
Yes...

428
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:43,100
So,

429
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,862
What's with these tears?

430
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:50,981
Who's made her cry?

431
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:52,926
She's getting married.

432
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:56,899
She's crying out of the grief of separation.

433
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:58,620
Oh,

434
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,011
Right...

435
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:04,404
So she's crying just as a formality, so to speak!

436
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:07,994
Don't cry when you come here again.

437
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:13,994
I'll serve you some of the finest coconut biscuits, aye!

438
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,003
She may be the first girl who's wept in sorrow for you.

439
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:01,715
That's why you've started missing her.

440
00:31:02,642 --> 00:31:05,303
Marry her.

441
00:31:05,303 --> 00:31:07,437
You couldn't get anything in love.

442
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:09,970
Give someone something, and get even.

443
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,982
Are you crazy?

444
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:16,140
I should give her four days of my life that I've got left, and ruin forty years of hers?

445
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,979
If love gets four days,

446
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,991
It doesn't bother about forty years.

447
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,552
I've seen her condition.

448
00:31:21,552 --> 00:31:26,153
She sees you a hundred times in one glance.

449
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,129
God have mercy on my Mum;

450
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:33,810
She'd say, 'Marry the girl who loves you',

451
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:38,136
'Not the one whom only you love [but doesn't love you back]'.

452
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:42,122
She's taken great care of me for four months, mate...

453
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:44,516
She's a right spitfire.

454
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:48,602
Seeing her, it doesn't seem that she could love anyone, really.

455
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:51,574
But --
-If you commit the sin of kicking love away,

456
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,486
It'll kill you one day.

457
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:59,033
Anytime you laugh, it'd torment you that she weeps at the thought of you.

458
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:02,452
Here's an idea.

459
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,494
Never think of her again.

460
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:08,233
Don't remember, also, that she'd taken good care of you for four months,

461
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,378
Nor that

462
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:10,895
You have pity on her

463
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,910
When she weeps.

464
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,967
I won't think of her again.

465
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:33,269
More than a hundred Englishmen in Yorkshire

466
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:37,550
Have taken to playing gilli danda [Asian sport], I tell you!

467
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,478
And the credit goes to me!

468
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,603
I'm settling the scores with them.

469
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:47,172
I'll ruin them with this habit of gilli danda

470
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:51,820
The same way the buggers had ruined India!

471
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,981
But, Monseigneur,

472
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,944
Even a single man there

473
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:16,982
Is like a nation by himself.

474
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:19,053
Touché on that.

475
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:23,858
That's why even gilli danda can't ruin them.

476
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,838
Sit over here.

477
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:48,467
I know the history of this room.

478
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:51,097
You bring anyone you want to insult here.

479
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:53,874
The history of this room is about to change tonight.

480
00:33:53,874 --> 00:33:56,626
I've brought you here to tell you

481
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:58,700
That I've decided to marry you.

482
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,614
What?

483
00:33:59,614 --> 00:34:00,989
Hold your horses!

484
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:02,256
Listen to the whole thing.

485
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,632
I'm listening.

486
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:07,021
You just don't listen to what the heart says.

487
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:10,052
I will keep on listening to it, now...

488
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:13,980
By the way, you're not a good psychiatrist either.

489
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,399
Look,

490
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:19,151
You may insult me, but do not say a word against my profession.

491
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,081
Know what,

492
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:21,472
We'd just get married.

493
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,483
We'll never be able to love each other.

494
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:24,611
I don't care.

495
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:27,004
Love isn't required to get married.

496
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:27,669
Know what,

497
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:30,232
Love is no feeling, psychologically speaking.

498
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:33,104
It's just a knavish trick to have one's way and get to that end.

499
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,591
But marriage is no trick; it's a contract.

500
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:38,802
A lifelong contract between two parties.

501
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:40,332
Even if the world turns upside-down,

502
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:42,186
One's got to stand by that contract.

503
00:34:42,186 --> 00:34:44,819
So you don't believe in love at all?

504
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,272
When did I say that?

505
00:34:46,272 --> 00:34:48,401
I do, but

506
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:51,600
I don't believe in marrying out of love.

507
00:34:52,105 --> 00:34:54,241
Do you know, most of my patients are that sort --

508
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:56,756
The kind who'd loved before marriage.

509
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:59,153
When I see anyone in love, I say,

510
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:02,617
'Aye, yer comin' to me, laddie'...

511
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,164
That's just what I deserve...

512
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:07,708
What?

513
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:12,125
I'm getting married to a lowlife like you!

514
00:35:18,308 --> 00:35:20,499
This is very insulting!

515
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:23,154
I'll have this one specifically written in the contract

516
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:27,235
That you can't insult me again and again like this!

517
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,053
Why are you picking your nose?

518
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:51,586
Come here.

519
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,149
Over here.

520
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,395
Come here.

521
00:35:56,852 --> 00:35:58,061
Show me your hand.

522
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,417
Like this.

523
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:03,635
Hey! Don't hit him!

524
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,973
I'm not hitting him, Mam; I'm just scaring him.

525
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:08,068
Go back and sit.

526
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:11,718
And don't you dare pick your nose again.

527
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:18,157
Alright, where were we?

528
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:21,195
Mam, would you see who it is?

529
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:24,667
I'll go and see.

530
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:42,556
Ifrah!

531
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,096
You're sleeping when I'm teaching?

532
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:47,733
Come here.

533
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,856
Over here.

534
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:58,999
Show me your hand.

535
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,130
Properly. Like this.

536
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,892
Hey! Don't hit her!

537
00:37:02,892 --> 00:37:06,850
I'm not hitting her; I'm just scaring her!

538
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:24,954
The tea's very good.

539
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,856
Why were you surprised to see me?

540
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:32,391
Because we met again the very next day.

541
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:35,480
But why are you skirting around the point?

542
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,075
Get to the point, will you?

543
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,292
The point?

544
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,845
You said yesterday that you like me,

545
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:43,544
Alright,

546
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:44,760
Thank you very much.

547
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,677
Go on.

548
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:51,684
What it is is, I'm the kind of girl who'd talk in a clear-cut and to-the-point way.

549
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:58,075
I don't like it that a don type chap like you should say one half and hold the other half in.

550
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,640
I'd said something else to you, too.

551
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,361
I think I forgot...

552
00:38:04,361 --> 00:38:07,269
Remind me what you'd said?

553
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,066
You've forgotten too, innit?

554
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,770
How couldn't you forget?

555
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,318
Just a thought of me is enough to cause this memory loss of yours.

556
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:21,392
Whatever would you remember if I stood firm before you?

557
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:24,033
Besides, which muppet would say in a surprise meeting,

558
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,985
'Listen, my dear, I don't love you'.

559
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,782
Be a man, Afzal Subhanallah.

560
00:38:29,782 --> 00:38:31,419
I find those who talk politics

561
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:32,841
Before saying 'I love you'

562
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,794
Rather toxic!

563
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,597
I love someone else, Yasmin.

564
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:52,969
<i>Every compeer abandoned me...</i>

565
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:54,734
There's something new!

566
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:58,940
Now it sounds like you're a man!

567
00:39:03,112 --> 00:39:06,268
Just that, or are you going to add anything else?

568
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,475
I mean,

569
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,692
What's her name,

570
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:11,244
Where does she live...

571
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,589
It isn't necessary that you reply at all,

572
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:17,779
But I can't help it; I'm a girl...

573
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:21,040
I'd even ask such meaningless questions.

574
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,851
How does she look?

575
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:27,629
Well, to the devil with her looks.

576
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:32,913
When has love ever thought whether the lass looks as lush as Yasmin or not...

577
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:38,582
Is it the same one, by any chance, who'd come from Hyderabad?

578
00:39:38,582 --> 00:39:39,213
Farah!

579
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,983
Farah Ibrahim!

580
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:43,436
There!

581
00:39:43,436 --> 00:39:47,760
My Spidey Sense had started tingling the moment I'd seen her.

582
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,866
I won't tell you her name.

583
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:55,686
Why?

584
00:39:56,677 --> 00:40:00,168
She doesn't love me.

585
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:02,839
So everything's going on one-sided?

586
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:04,123
There!

587
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:06,473
Mam had been right all along, hadn't she?

588
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,437
So, there was a lass after all!

589
00:40:08,437 --> 00:40:10,727
And you're such a secret squirrel

590
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:14,418
That you never let anyone know for five months!

591
00:40:14,418 --> 00:40:18,589
You didn't even let me find out!

592
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,378
Alright, don't tell me her name.

593
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,769
Just tell me this -

594
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:26,847
Is she more beautiful than me?

595
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:32,324
She's very beautiful, Yasmin,

596
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:36,651
But not more than you.

597
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,000
Loser...

598
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
