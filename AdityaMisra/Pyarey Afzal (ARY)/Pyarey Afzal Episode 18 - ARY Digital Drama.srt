1
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:13,485
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:18,770
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,829
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:30,270
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,799
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:40,446
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:07,462
10,000 will be enough to provide both of them with food,

8
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,893
And we'd be making a profit of 10,000!

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,913
He was up to his trickery, offering the old 8,000.

10
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:16,933
I said, 'Watch who you're talking to'!

11
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,171
And he,

12
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:19,662
The one from Hyderabad,

13
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,573
I gave him a right scolding.

14
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,632
I even said, 'You have a bad reputation in Mam's eyes'!

15
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:26,662
'Shut your gob'!

16
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:28,889
Is he married?

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,389
Doesn't seem so, judging by his words,

18
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:32,763
Although someone his age should get married.

19
00:01:32,763 --> 00:01:35,032
I'd seen him yesterday.

20
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,037
He does look lush.

21
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:39,177
What's it to us if he looks lush?

22
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:40,883
He's very insolent, by the way.

23
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,813
Took him two days to start a slanging match!

24
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:44,420
The way he addresses me with a simple 'you'!

25
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,065
How else should he address you?

26
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:47,011
Hey!

27
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,443
I'm his landlady,

28
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,339
At the very least he should say 'Madam' or 'Lady'!

29
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:53,029
It appears he's from a good family.

30
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,859
I'll ask him this one, too.

31
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:55,999
What will you ask?

32
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:59,180
The same - 'Do you come from a good family, or is it just Mam who thinks so'?

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,450
Don't you dare ask him anything like this!

34
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,839
Well, I can ask Babu Hamid about this too.

35
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,999
But what have we to do with his family?

36
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:13,499
As long as he quietly enjoys his food and pays us the money, and keeps fearing God!

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,570
Can one's face ever tell one about one's family?

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,110
It doesn't, does it?

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,832
Will they

40
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,460
Be serving us potatoes and lentils everyday?

41
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,050
No.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,851
We'll be served chicken on Sundays.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,170
Enough with it, Salim,

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,272
Enough with it!

45
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,692
Enough with what?

46
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:53,740
Enough with what?

47
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,609
Sit down.
-How many times will you ask me?

48
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,830
It's Saturday today.
-You already know everything!

49
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,739
Tell me everything!

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,810
Tell me!

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,369
Be honest with me,

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,096
Did he ever touch you?

53
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,833
Never!

54
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,466
He used to say, 'Touching besmirches love'.

55
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,338
Oh?

56
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,587
Was he the son of a saint?

57
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:32,027
And you're praising him before me!

58
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,909
The blighter's here.

59
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,319
Tell her

60
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,792
That it's our personal affair.

61
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:45,541
She'd better not poke her nose in our affairs!

62
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,990
Yes, sir?

63
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:15,239
Why is your husband beating you?

64
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,380
Look, sir,

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,181
It is our personal affair.

66
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:18,990
No --

67
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,822
It no longer remains your personal affair when you scream so loudly.

68
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,880
Who are you?

69
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:25,933
I --

70
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,023
Live just across here

71
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:29,233
With Babu Hamid.

72
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:30,953
Please, leave,

73
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:35,166
And take it that the fault lies with me.

74
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,310
Listen, sir!

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,029
Yes?

76
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,181
Have you come from Hyderabad?

77
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,162
Yes?

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,591
Is your name Afzal?

79
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,941
It is.

80
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,745
Hey!

81
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,362
What are you doing, Timmy?

82
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,968
Let go!

83
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,555
Where's he gone?

84
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,553
Who?

85
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:55,525
Afzal.

86
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:57,849
He played his last match with you.

87
00:05:57,849 --> 00:05:59,259
Match, as in, gambling.

88
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,534
For 100,000, no less.

89
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,990
Where'd he go after that?

90
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,050
Karachi.

91
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,660
Where in Karachi?

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,339
I don't know.

93
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:09,900
Press harder!
-Timmy, mate, I seriously don't know what happened next!

94
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,231
I'd dropped him at the station, that's it!

95
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,384
I'd even said, 'Don't go'!

96
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,710
But he doesn't listen to anyone, now, does he?

97
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,730
Let him go.

98
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,830
He must call you sometimes.

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,839
His phone's switched off.

100
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,750
He must've gotten a new number.

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,379
Go and ask his family, will you?

102
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,810
He must be calling them sometime!

103
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,090
He doesn't.

104
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,640
Molvi Sahab came to me.

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,530
He was just asking how everything was going,

106
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,580
But, as he left, he said,

107
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,199
'Does Afzal talk to you'?

108
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,486
I said, 'Not at all'.

109
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:41,881
'His number's switched off'.

110
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,050
He was a bit dispirited to hear this

111
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,780
And said, 'Yes, his number's switched off'...

112
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,710
Go, now.

113
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,400
If you get in touch with him, if he calls... Just let us know, okay?

114
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,760
I will, surely.

115
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,991
I'll tell you that instant.

116
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:20,859
Why aren't you eating anything?

117
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,960
I will if I learn.

118
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,860
Learn what?

119
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,721
Please, go on.

120
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,590
I'm watching and learning

121
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,661
How one can swallow a bite like this.

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,779
Do you actually eat it, or do you just put up a pretence for me?

123
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,559
I'll try, too, today.

124
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,544
If you keep on trying,

125
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,043
I'll have to call the doctor.

126
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:58,311
And he charges additional fees for coming here.

127
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,919
The rest is up to you.

128
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,969
I'd gone to Karachi two years ago.

129
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,539
I don't even remember if that blasted sea is where it used to be,

130
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:10,629
Or has it, too, skedaddled...

131
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,799
So what's the big deal in going to Karachi?

132
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,530
We can go again.

133
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,360
But

134
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,189
Where will we look for him?

135
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,609
The city's as large as a country.

136
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:27,359
Is it too big for a mother's heart?

137
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,661
I can find my son with eyes both shut, Molvi Sahab.

138
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,084
Alright, then.

139
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,052
Make ready to leave.

140
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,485
We can depart

141
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:47,094
Any one of these days you pick.

142
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,304
But remember,

143
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:56,421
A defeated mother's son

144
00:08:56,421 --> 00:09:00,610
Can never triumph himself.

145
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,191
Call Arifa and ask her

146
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,969
To send a picture of him.

147
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,019
Right,

148
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:53,533
What would you do with the picture?

149
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:58,749
Hey!

150
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:00,115
What would I do with it?

151
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,771
But we can ask for a picture and help them.

152
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,050
How?

153
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:05,946
We'll run an advertisement on TV.

154
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:06,380
That --

155
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,623
'A 32-year-old has run away from home, embarrassed'.

156
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:11,826
We'll have Arifa's voiceover with it.

157
00:10:11,826 --> 00:10:13,646
She'll be saying with a melancholic voice,

158
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,176
'Come home, dear brother',

159
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,456
'Everyone's distressed',

160
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:17,876
'Dad's quietened up',

161
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:19,956
'Mum's not eating anything in her sorrow'.

162
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:20,646
You'll see,

163
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,116
He'll come back running!

164
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:23,646
What if he actually came?

165
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:24,416
So what?

166
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,676
He may come back with the Lord's blessings,

167
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:26,736
Stay at home,

168
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:28,176
And take care of his Mum and Dad.

169
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,876
Where will you be pursuing your MPhil from?

170
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,016
You can't from Hyderabad.

171
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,696
How does that even relate

172
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,610
To me pursuing my MPhil?

173
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,868
When I'd said

174
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:37,997
That I'm not going to London,

175
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:39,946
What does it mean?

176
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:41,436
That's what I'm asking.

177
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,956
Dad will talk to me tonight.

178
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,456
He'll ask, 'What is Farah up to'?

179
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:46,896
Why would Dad ask you?

180
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,206
Am I dead?

181
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,346
Well,

182
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:52,116
Even if he wants to ask you,

183
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,476
Then -- Just say,

184
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:56,286
That I'm firm in my intentions to go to Karachi.

185
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:58,016
Should I call now?

186
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,017
Call whom?

187
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:00,427
Arifa.

188
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,569
Oh, right.

189
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:03,727
I'll ask the driver to get the photograph from her.

190
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:04,416
Talk to her.

191
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,276
Get the picture.

192
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,226
But that blighter won't be coming back just like that.

193
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:09,736
You're right there.

194
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,848
He'd only come back if someone showed up at his doorstep,

195
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:14,567
Grabbed him by the collar, and said a few foul words to awaken his conscience.

196
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,006
No.

197
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,126
Just get a photograph.

198
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:20,147
One should keep all possible options in mind,

199
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,880
Right?

200
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:33,676
Hello?

201
00:11:33,676 --> 00:11:35,784
How are you?

202
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:38,586
I'm fine.

203
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:40,716
And Mum and Dad?

204
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:43,016
They're better than me.

205
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,697
They're strutting about affectedly, looking at each other now and then.

206
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:46,716
Tell me,

207
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:48,670
Is everything alright over there?

208
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,386
Everything's fine, so to speak.

209
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:52,657
Farah was asking for his photograph.

210
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:53,716
Hey!

211
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:55,386
She'd run an advertisement on TV,

212
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,776
One of those 'missing persons' ads,

213
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,586
Complete with your voiceover.

214
00:11:58,586 --> 00:11:59,946
Is she mad?

215
00:11:59,946 --> 00:12:01,855
Tell her he's not missing!

216
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:04,497
She's lost him!

217
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:05,157
Alright --

218
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,947
Just give her his picture.

219
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:10,466
I know he's not missing, too.

220
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,216
May I request something?

221
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,916
Sure.

222
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,496
You'd better not call me.

223
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:22,006
I have no quarrel with you, but

224
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:25,646
It's only you or Afzal who calls me.

225
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,946
When you call, I get a feeling

226
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,036
Afzal's calling.

227
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:34,630
A ray of hope shines bright when the phone rings,

228
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,770
But gets extinguished at the sight of your name on the phone.

229
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:39,665
Look,

230
00:12:39,665 --> 00:12:41,661
Please don't mind it.

231
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,659
You folks have everything, right?

232
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,192
We have only our Afzal.

233
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:53,466
We, his family, live in hopes of seeing his return.

234
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,150
Tell Farah, too,

235
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,746
That if she starts pitying people like this,

236
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:01,788
She'd try taking the Lord's affairs into her own hands.

237
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:05,930
There are many lads in Hyderabad who, embarrassed or vexed,

238
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,936
Have left their homes.

239
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,453
Ask her why she does not worry for any of them.

240
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:15,073
The reason to ask for a photograph is not to run a TV advertisement.

241
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:16,024
Then, that's --

242
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,994
Worse than running an advertisement on TV, innit, Lubna?

243
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,223
Remember,

244
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:23,006
She'd turned my brother down, pushed him away

245
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:24,478
At every opportunity she could get,

246
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:28,453
And all of us honoured her right to do so.

247
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:33,184
It's only fair that she, too, honour our right to refuse now.

248
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:38,724
I don't think she even deserves a photograph of Afzal.

249
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,571
Yes, Dad?

250
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,857
Come and sit here.

251
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,740
So what have you figured?

252
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,610
Have you tried getting at what's gotten into her heart?

253
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,939
What is she thinking of and why?

254
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:30,160
Please send her to Karachi.

255
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,913
What if I didn't?

256
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,161
The final decision will be yours to take,

257
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,551
But please, just let her complete.

258
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,789
But why is she vouching for her?

259
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,299
Because I'm with her all the time,

260
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,690
And I know her better than the two of you.

261
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,422
And I also know

262
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:49,330
That it'll take no more than four days for your order to crumble before her obstinacy.

263
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,529
So, it's better that you think about what she wants

264
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,660
Than getting angry with me.

265
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,270
What does she want?

266
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,710
The three of us must go...

267
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,310
To Farah?

268
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,399
No, Dad, to a psychiatrist.

269
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,962
You think I'm not the full shilling?

270
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,120
I would never go!

271
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:15,602
Why are you saying such things?

272
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,737
Just try to understand what I'm saying.

273
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:19,977
This girl will drive us mad.

274
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:21,727
That's right.

275
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:22,927
That's just what I'm saying --

276
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:26,737
Alright, I'll look for a good psychiatrist.

277
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:30,287
She must get treated, but will she go to him?

278
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:35,017
She'd say the moment she'd hear, 'You think I'm mad'?

279
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,487
Then, let her go to Karachi.

280
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,237
The same, again?

281
00:15:40,237 --> 00:15:42,739
She's stumbling around in the dark within herself.

282
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,787
She wants to prove

283
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,660
That she just sympathises with him.

284
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,241
With whom?

285
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,987
Afzal.

286
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,559
However in the blazes is Afzal related to this conversation?

287
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,329
He's the only one who is related to this.

288
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:00,779
It's just that she's denying it.

289
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,179
Care to explain in simpler words?

290
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:06,539
Tell me.

291
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:12,039
Explain your point like you would to one who's unlettered and nescient!

292
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,010
She loves Afzal...

293
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,080
I don't feel the slightest of sorrow on hearing this.

294
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,669
But it'll grieve you to hear

295
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:25,910
That she doesn't know this herself.

296
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,719
What?

297
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,159
Whatever the dickens is she talking about, Irsa?

298
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:34,330
She's french fried my brain!

299
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,510
I'll take my leave.

300
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,509
That's what I don't like one bit about you.

301
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,173
You'd immerse your father in simmering hot oil, fry him into a croquette,

302
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,129
And then say, 'I'll take my leave'!

303
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:47,213
Dad, she'll think we're conniving against her.

304
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:50,129
What else are we doing?

305
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,085
Right...

306
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow morning.

307
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,680
I need a good psychiatrist!

308
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:07,240
Go.

309
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:32,582
Who shut the door to Dad's room?

310
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:34,283
Dad, of course.

311
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:36,043
Were you there?

312
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,792
I was coming back from there

313
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,815
When I saw you get out.

314
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:42,848
Then you've heard everything.

315
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:45,692
Ration my rum if I understood anything except 'french fried'.

316
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:48,313
But why did he bring french fries into such a serious conversation?

317
00:17:48,313 --> 00:17:50,344
That's what I'm wondering.

318
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,661
Dad's lost his English, apparently.

319
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:55,350
He said, 'You've french fried my brain'!

320
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,630
I've never heard about 'french fried brain'.

321
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,051
You don't get it.

322
00:17:59,051 --> 00:18:00,940
You know how they slice potatoes into french fries?

323
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,440
He must be alluding to that.

324
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:05,500
But why did he?

325
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,240
When I said, 'Let Farah go to Karachi',

326
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,964
That's what escaped his mouth.

327
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,621
This is nothing of the sort

328
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,850
That'd french fry one's brain.

329
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,650
I'd also said,

330
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,080
'She doesn't even know herself why she's going to Karachi'.

331
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,050
In other words,

332
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,480
You said,

333
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,190
'Farah's gone mad'?

334
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,760
I swear by God I didn't say that.

335
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,980
Your seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you've gone mad.

336
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,321
Lubna?
-Just see one for once.

337
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,230
At least it'll satisfy everyone.

338
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,745
Whom will it satisfy except you?

339
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:37,770
I have no such issue.

340
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,370
But Dad's officially lost it.

341
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,021
He facepalms the moment he hears what you say.

342
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:46,381
All of this is because of you.

343
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:49,668
You're trying to prove to Dad that I'm certifiable,

344
00:18:49,668 --> 00:18:51,620
And telling him

345
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,550
That Farah's not the full shilling!

346
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,494
Good Lord!

347
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,311
You'd even have said

348
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,530
That I'm going to Karachi to look for that runagate.

349
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,261
There!

350
00:19:03,261 --> 00:19:05,771
You've overheard the whole thing, haven't you?

351
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,891
Did you actually say all of this?

352
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,285
It was just in the flow of conversation that I said,

353
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,091
'Perhaps, it's possible'...

354
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:15,434
Oh God...

355
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:18,221
But he didn't feel the slightest of sorrow to hear this.

356
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,776
It's rather surprising, Farah,

357
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:23,536
He's usually merry as a grig at the mention of Afzal!

358
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:24,721
Get out.

359
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,691
What?

360
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:27,671
I said get out!

361
00:19:27,671 --> 00:19:29,699
If you poked your prating trap in my affairs again,

362
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,762
Or gave any bright ideas to Mum and Dad,

363
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,832
I'd kill you for real!

364
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:35,398
Hold it, Farah.

365
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,472
You're taking everyone except yourself lightly.

366
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,195
People other than yourself

367
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:40,697
Are not marionettes;

368
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:43,612
They have never, and will never dance to your tune.

369
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:44,953
I'm your sister,

370
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:47,461
Which is why I double as a psychiatrist in times of need.

371
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,851
The truth is that your madness does not convince people!

372
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,242
Care to ask

373
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:54,064
What happened to Afzal's photograph,

374
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:58,176
And what Arifa said when I asked her for one?

375
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,476
What did she say?

376
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:02,507
She said you don't even deserve his photograph.

377
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:03,516
Tell me,

378
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,853
Do you?

379
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:05,646
No.

380
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:07,116
Not at all.

381
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:09,186
Let me give you a parting piece of advice.

382
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,996
Run an advertisement for yourself on TV,

383
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,896
One of those 'missing persons' advertisements,

384
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,956
Complete with my voiceover,

385
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:16,336
Tearfully saying,

386
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:18,346
'This girl is searching for herself'.

387
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:20,066
'Please help her',

388
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:23,066
'Or pray for her'.

389
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,559
His build looks fit.

390
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,280
Could you have your hair cut?

391
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Hair?

392
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,950
Why would he have to have his hair cut?

393
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,839
Babu, boyo, he should look like a commando in his uniform.

394
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,350
Why should I look like a commando --
-I'm talking to Babu Hamid.

395
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,540
He's been scoring third division marks throughout.

396
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:29,019
With such excellent credentials, he won't be getting a job inside the office.

397
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:29,943
Then?

398
00:21:29,943 --> 00:21:31,570
He can get one outside.

399
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,880
What's the job outside the office?

400
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,210
He can be a security guard.

401
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,140
I'm saying this because his uprightness works in his favour.

402
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,189
He looks like a security guard.

403
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,830
His salary will be 10,000.

404
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,820
Now and then,

405
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,383
He'd salute the toffs, and open the door for them;

406
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,879
He'd get some reward for that.

407
00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:49,769
He'll easily make up to 15,000.

408
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,359
Isn't the salary a tad too low?

409
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,220
How much would you want, sir?

410
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,642
1.5 million a day.

411
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,882
Stop laughing.

412
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,100
You may note it down.

413
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,374
One day, you'd be working as a security guard under me.

414
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:09,179
You have a fit build too.

415
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, the stomach peeps out a bit, but...

416
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,789
It'll do.

417
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,090
Come, Babu Hamid.

418
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:19,060
By the way,

419
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,141
Here's the payment for the tea.

420
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:24,895
You may consider any overheads a benefaction.

421
00:22:33,633 --> 00:22:37,233
Why did you say the thing about 1.5 million a day?

422
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,943
Are you thinking of becoming a politician?

423
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,923
Theirs is a trade that earns them so much...

424
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:46,923
1.5 million a day, perhaps even 150 million a day.

425
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:52,226
I used to make aeroplanes like that in my younger days.

426
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:55,536
Tad would be delighted to see, and say in a lively voice, 'You'll see, Arifa',

427
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:58,816
'My son will become a pilot one day'.

428
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,376
Arifa?

429
00:23:00,376 --> 00:23:02,720
Arifa was my Mam's name.

430
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,766
Hey!

431
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:06,003
My sister's name is Arifa!

432
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:08,666
Surely, your Mam's name isn't Ruqaiyya?

433
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,106
Yes!

434
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:12,144
My Mum's name is Ruqaiyya.

435
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:14,266
How do you know?

436
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:17,060
Ruqaiyya was my younger sister's name.

437
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,936
Why

438
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,621
Do you say 'was'?

439
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:21,317
She's gone now.

440
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,847
My Mam, my Tad,

441
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,897
My sister, my brother...

442
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:26,507
All gone.

443
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:27,538
Where?

444
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:28,947
They're dead, boyo.

445
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:31,647
Gone, so to speak.

446
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,089
All at once?

447
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,732
Yes.

448
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:37,980
All at once,

449
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,338
One night,

450
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:40,804
One a minute earlier,

451
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:43,000
Another a minute later.

452
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,367
They had an accident?

453
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,632
No accident, mun, but murder.

454
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:51,512
Four murders over a feud over one-fourth an acre of land.

455
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,799
Acreage, boyo, has in its innate nature

456
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,254
A particular hunger for corpses.

457
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,418
Sometimes, when it's ravenous,

458
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,867
It may not settle for anything under eight for one-fourth of an acre.

459
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:01,617
Eight?

460
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:03,859
But you just said four.

461
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,819
Four of them died too.

462
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:10,060
I killed them.

463
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,081
Farah?

464
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:04,127
Please step aside.

465
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,110
Who is it, Arifa?

466
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,030
It's Farah, Mum.

467
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:13,479
Farah Ibrahim.

468
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,729
What has my son done this time?

469
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,910
My dear,

470
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:33,269
We are no longer responsible for his words and deeds now.

471
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:37,125
He's left our place.

472
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,752
When one leaves one country and settles in another,

473
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:43,999
The other country's law applies to him.

474
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:46,699
I'm not here to talk about him, Aunt,

475
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:49,939
Nor do I have any complaint.

476
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,370
Right...

477
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,980
So you've just come...

478
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,339
To meet us.

479
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,410
In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

480
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:04,106
Have Farah sit.

481
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:07,126
Ask her if she'll have tea or coffee.

482
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:12,276
Tea or coffee?

483
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:15,497
Do I deserve coffee?

484
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:19,236
If I don't deserve his photograph,

485
00:26:19,236 --> 00:26:23,687
How do I deserve to have coffee at his place?

486
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:27,889
Tell me,

487
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,169
What brings you here?

488
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:43,169
What are you looking at down there?

489
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,319
He hasn't come yet.

490
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:47,639
So what if he hasn't?

491
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,339
Why are you worried only about him?

492
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm not worried about him.

493
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,000
I've been thinking about lunch.

494
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,860
If he doesn't have lunch a few times, he'd say at the end of the month,

495
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,759
'I didn't have lunch on this and this day; I won't be paying for that'.

496
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,949
Why wouldn't he?

497
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:05,071
We'd cooked the food for him, hadn't we?

498
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:07,019
Alright, don't lean and look down there.

499
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:10,159
You might just fall face-first.

500
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:15,617
He's here, Mam!

501
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,678
Serve him food.

502
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,059
That one seems to be his room.

503
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:34,982
Yes.

504
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:36,829
It's his.

505
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,639
Why have you locked it?

506
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:44,779
Mum has a feeling he's in his room when it's not locked.

507
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,939
Oh...

508
00:27:49,779 --> 00:27:51,190
He's earned a BA, hasn't he?

509
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,169
Scoring a third division throughout?

510
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,019
Whatever kind of job will he get with that?

511
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,229
There was still some scope in Hyderabad.

512
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:02,969
Quite a few bigwigs around here know Uncle, too.

513
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:05,250
Who in Karachi would hire him?

514
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,870
You'll see,

515
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,700
He'll end up in bad company.

516
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,750
God will help him.

517
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,669
God will,

518
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:14,579
But only if he does something too.

519
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,174
He could've pursued an MA.

520
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:17,169
Perhaps

521
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:18,949
He could've scored a better division?

522
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,700
He's done with his studies, Farah.

523
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,140
Anyway; That's his personal matter.

524
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,869
But there's no wisdom in it.

525
00:28:34,656 --> 00:28:37,946
I figure he must've left a letter?

526
00:28:38,709 --> 00:28:39,930
Yes.

527
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,071
He has one for theatrics, I'd give him that!

528
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,419
What's written in the letter?

529
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:51,949
The letter, too, is his personal matter, innit?

530
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:53,310
Oh...

531
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,209
Sorry...

532
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,136
Anyway,

533
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,847
He'd written,

534
00:28:58,847 --> 00:29:01,956
'I'm not coming back until I've become something'.

535
00:29:01,956 --> 00:29:03,906
What will he become?

536
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:04,576
I mean --

537
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,006
Surely, he must've thought of something?

538
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,649
He never got the opportunity to think.

539
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:13,656
He'd be thinking now.

540
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,380
Honestly,

541
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,900
You folks don't blame me, do you?

542
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,400
Molvi Uncle surely wouldn't,

543
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,370
But your Mum...

544
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,670
Perhaps she thinks he's left because of me?

545
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,320
No --

546
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,414
Whatever the answer is,

547
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:38,231
It won't hurt me at all.

548
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:41,671
I, too, feel that the fault also lies with me.

549
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:44,310
What's your fault?

550
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,109
When I'd --

551
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:47,120
Brought his letters

552
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,760
Before your Mum and Dad...

553
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,590
Why did I have to tell any of that?

554
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,640
I could've just called you

555
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,672
And said,

556
00:29:54,672 --> 00:29:55,563
'I swear by God',

557
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:57,940
'I've not written those letters'.

558
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,483
Yes.

559
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:00,954
You could've.

560
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:02,090
But you!

561
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,670
You'd barged in to my house and started your own theatrics!

562
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,644
That's what had enraged me.

563
00:30:07,644 --> 00:30:09,893
Everything happens for the better, Farah.

564
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,610
These are just hollow sayings.

565
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,920
When something bad happens,

566
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,380
It doesn't happen for the better.

567
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,360
What has happend that's bad for you?

568
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,140
Wouldn't I have felt sorrow?

569
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,160
Your Mum and Dad --

570
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,911
My heart sinks to think of them.

571
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:36,460
I feel as if I've committed a grave sin.

572
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,899
You have not sinned.

573
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,379
An honourable and virtuous girl should do exactly what you had.

574
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:43,939
Innit?

575
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:47,941
You shouldn't feel regret over this either.

576
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:50,149
Afzal's my brother, but

577
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:53,379
He wasn't being fair on you.

578
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:56,629
It has certainly wracked our hearts with grief that he's left,

579
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:01,360
But so has the fact that he's two-timing a girl.

580
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,160
Whom is he two-timing?

581
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,989
The one who writes him letters.

582
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,032
Ah, right!

583
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,349
The other Farah!

584
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:10,119
I'd forgotten her entirely!

585
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,189
Find out, Arifa,

586
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:11,869
Who she is,

587
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:15,289
What she does, and where she lives.

588
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,629
It won't do any good.

589
00:31:17,629 --> 00:31:19,489
Why wouldn't it?

590
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:22,510
She can help us bring Afzal back.

591
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,651
What will the poor lass help us?

592
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,510
Her own love is at stake.

593
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,059
She'd have Afzal's new cell number!

594
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,073
Right!

595
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:34,590
He'd definitely be talking to her.

596
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,929
No?

597
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,740
He wouldn't be talking to her.

598
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,830
That's why she writes letters.

599
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,669
Afzal must be writing, too.

600
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:44,719
I mean, he must be replying to her in the least?

601
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,009
Perhaps.

602
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,820
Why are you saying, 'Perhaps'?

603
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,399
Obviously, he replies; That's why she writes to him!

604
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,649
She isn't mad,

605
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,934
To just keep on writing herself.

606
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,680
The most bizarre things can happen in love

607
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,410
That would never happen in sensibility.

608
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,671
Look, now,

609
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:02,470
At how you, in your senses, said it,

610
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,881
'The road ahead is yours alone, Monsieur',

611
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,550
'I have no ties with you'.

612
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,430
It ended there.

613
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,300
Now, if someone's ready to sacrifice his life for you,

614
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,199
But you have no ties with him,

615
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,440
What does it matter to you if he

616
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,180
Goes to Karachi or the wops?

617
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,781
Right...

618
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:24,354
You're right there.

619
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,590
But --
-When I'm right,

620
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,181
Why this 'but'?

621
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:31,933
Just pray that he comes back, having become something,

622
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:34,321
And tell us upon his return who it is who writes him letters,

623
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:36,023
What she does, where she lives;

624
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,911
Then, I can convince Mum and Dad.

625
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:41,230
'Convince', as in?

626
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,840
It's pretty simple.

627
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,230
I'll get the two of them married, of course.

628
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,890
Right...

629
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,090
They should get married...

630
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,480
It's almost evening, Arifa.

631
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,912
I'll take my leave.

632
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,060
You'd come again, wouldn't you?

633
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,700
Sure, why not?

634
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,690
I'll come again, if the Lord wills.

635
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,807
Why are you laughing?

636
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,897
Your brother's left home and gone,

637
00:33:38,897 --> 00:33:41,637
And you're giggling gleefully!

638
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:43,759
No, Mum,

639
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,464
I'm tearing up to think of this poor Farah.

640
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,447
Which poor Farah?

641
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:50,037
The one who just left,

642
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:52,188
Or the one who never came?

643
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:54,041
However did she come in?

644
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:57,227
She would if she were ever there.
-What?

645
00:33:57,227 --> 00:34:01,925
If she'd never been there, was it her father who wrote the letters?

646
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:03,367
Look,

647
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,757
I'm very restless to begin with,

648
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,837
Please don't give me new fears.

649
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:12,286
Fear the one who's just left.

650
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:16,176
Don't think about the one who never came here.

651
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,256
I dread her already.

652
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:20,476
She's come here twice,

653
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,447
And left us clobbered each time.

654
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,590
O God, have mercy.

655
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,816
Does this lad not work?

656
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:36,366
Which lad?

657
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,616
What's his name --?

658
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,016
Afzal?

659
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:42,126
Yes, Afzal.

660
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,266
He must.

661
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:46,126
What's it to us if he doesn't, though?

662
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,381
Where does he get the money from?

663
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,476
Now,

664
00:34:49,476 --> 00:34:51,926
He's paid the rent for four months.

665
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:52,636
And,

666
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,926
On top of that, he's paid 10,000 in advance for his food.

667
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,036
How's he paying for everything?

668
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:58,410
Enjoy your mangoes, Mam,

669
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,305
Don't worry about the trees in the farm. [Mind your own business]

670
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,630
That's alright,

671
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,036
But we'd better know that the tree that produced these is indeed a mango tree.

672
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,986
Not gonna lie to you, though, he's good.

673
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,796
He's upright and doesn't look the wrong way.

674
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:12,353
He seems the mim and modest type.

675
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:14,089
He's just a tad lippy.

676
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:15,816
You're lippy too,

677
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:17,843
Ruffling everyone's feathers like you do!

678
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:21,536
If I'm not lippy, these men would eat me alive!

679
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,036
To add to it, I'm rather comely.

680
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:31,726
Am I not comely?

681
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:33,556
But of course, Yasmin, you are,

682
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:37,191
But please don't say it yourself!

683
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,646
Should I serve dinner?

684
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:42,784
Go.

685
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,850
But please don't start prattling.

686
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,395
Aren't you afraid?

687
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:07,480
The police will find you one day.

688
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,201
Have you ever thought what'd happen then?

689
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:14,146
What's the worst that can happen?

690
00:36:14,146 --> 00:36:15,817
They'd throw me in the quod,

691
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:17,586
Send me to the gallows, perhaps?

692
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:19,876
Let them, boyo.

693
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:24,356
Let a fifth die when four have already.

694
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:26,259
Oh?

695
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:28,459
Then why are you in hiding?

696
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,191
Go and face them,

697
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,449
And tell them you're prepared to die.

698
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:36,190
I'm not ready to die just yet.

699
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,362
I'm not afraid of dying,

700
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:42,157
But I want to live on.

701
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:44,789
There.

702
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:46,056
Go and open the door.

703
00:36:46,056 --> 00:36:49,476
The Reaper has come knocking.

704
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:56,388
Get out of the way.

705
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,928
And don't stare like that.

706
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:01,591
You could try asking for food yourself sometime, Babu Hamid,

707
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:03,128
Or is it that you folks don't feel hungry at all?

708
00:37:03,128 --> 00:37:04,718
It doesn't come to that.

709
00:37:04,718 --> 00:37:06,648
Here, we feel a bit of hunger,

710
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:09,598
And there you are.

711
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,530
The same potatoes and lentils?

712
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,119
Where's the potatoes?

713
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,001
Are you blind or do they call okras potatoes in Hyderabad?

714
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:19,419
Keep it there.

715
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:22,049
I will, sure.

716
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,399
You'd better know your limits.

717
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:30,459
Don't think of me as une femme frêle.

718
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,759
For the likes of you, I'm a ferocious wildcat.

719
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:36,166
I claw the faces of the insolent!

720
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,056
Hey!

721
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:39,311
It's good that you mentioned it.

722
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:42,235
I'd been thinking you're a girl for 20 days.

723
00:37:42,235 --> 00:37:43,216
By the way,

724
00:37:43,216 --> 00:37:45,436
What makes you leave after you've come?

725
00:37:45,436 --> 00:37:47,356
What?

726
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:49,136
Will you leave if I meow you?

727
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:50,196
No way, that's --

728
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:52,146
What you say to call a cat.

729
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:52,919
Then,

730
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:56,946
What do you say to shoo a cat away?

731
00:37:56,946 --> 00:37:59,436
Bleedin' dog!

732
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,020
C'mon, mate.

733
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,847
Have your dinner.

734
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,628
I'm starving.

735
00:38:11,628 --> 00:38:14,616
This ain't right, Afzal.

736
00:38:14,616 --> 00:38:17,256
What ain't right?

737
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:22,239
The punishment for breaking a heart is worse than gibbeting.

738
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,546
So, have some fear.

739
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,644
Come.

740
00:38:52,644 --> 00:38:55,404
I've seen you.

741
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,824
Who is it?

742
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,379
Who is it?
-Afzal.

743
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,767
What are you doing here?

744
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,820
I'd

745
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,882
Come to return the utensils.

746
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,747
You came through this door?

747
00:39:30,747 --> 00:39:32,380
Yes.

748
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,909
I think you don't know

749
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:37,861
But as per the rental agreement, you're not allowed to open this door.

750
00:39:37,861 --> 00:39:38,947
Anyway,

751
00:39:38,947 --> 00:39:41,027
We'll talk about it in the morning.

752
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:42,193
Listen.

753
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:44,223
The fault does not lie with Babu Hamid.

754
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,487
He retired immediately after having his dinner.

755
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:47,757
I --

756
00:39:47,757 --> 00:39:50,629
Thought this door leads to your place, so...

757
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:53,577
I came here on the pretext of handing you the utensils.

758
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,499
Pretext, as in?

759
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:56,417
No, it's --

760
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,547
Babu Hamid thinks

761
00:39:58,547 --> 00:40:00,857
I've broken your heart.

762
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,468
I couldn't fall asleep.

763
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,957
We don't have sleeping pills.

764
00:40:05,957 --> 00:40:08,307
I haven't come to ask for a pill.

765
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:11,687
I've come here to ask forgiveness.

766
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,139
That's neat.

767
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:16,017
You're a right emotional man.

768
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:18,247
Does this apology come from your heart,

769
00:40:18,247 --> 00:40:20,777
Or are you just apologising to impress me?

770
00:40:20,777 --> 00:40:22,607
Why would I impress you?

771
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:24,217
It happens this way, too,

772
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:25,917
You lost your heart to a comely lady,

773
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,297
So acted rough at first,

774
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:29,078
Then impressed with an apology.

775
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:31,452
But I'm not going to be impressed.

776
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:32,060
I'd --

777
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,389
Just come to apologise.

778
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,956
I haven't come here to impress.

779
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,500
Alright, then.

780
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,960
It's okay.

781
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,807
Thank you.

782
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:48,670
You're welcome.

783
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
