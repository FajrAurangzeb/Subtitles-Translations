1
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:13,568
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,761
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,841
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:30,242
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:35,766
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:40,481
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:20,662 --> 00:01:22,103
My good man,

8
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:25,085
Rob us of all our serenity if you want,

9
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:29,421
But please don't suck the life out of her just yet.

10
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:33,980
Your mother is very helpful to me.

11
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,443
Come here, my dear, why are you embarrassed?

12
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:42,819
Who's the outsider here, whose presence has you petrified?

13
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,828
There's good old Lubna,

14
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:46,061
And with her,

15
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,431
Sweet Farah.

16
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,714
She's come here to listen to all her letters!

17
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:53,309
You read them out with such evident pleasure!

18
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:58,559
And the poor lass cannot even remember what she's been writing to you all along!

19
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:30,595
Shut the door.

20
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,360
Dad will hear it if I said something.

21
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,810
Who writes you letters?

22
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,957
You are aware, Afzal, that I know how to get you talking.

23
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,506
It won't work today.

24
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,328
I will neither place my hand on your head, nor swear.

25
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,449
Can you fathom Dad's sorrow?

26
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:11,503
Mum slaps you and vents it out,

27
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,836
But he no longer slaps.

28
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,414
He's afraid of me.

29
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:24,229
I've weakened his faith in me.

30
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,234
I've dragged an honest Molvi down from his tribune onto the floor.

31
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,015
So you know all of this?

32
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:35,640
I also know that Mum curses her hands after slapping me.

33
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:39,046
Then why don't you correct yourself?

34
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:44,052
I can't be corrected.

35
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,302
What do you mean?

36
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:50,369
You'd pity me if I corrected myself.

37
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,250
I'd have to pass through the same alley her car drives through everyday.

38
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:05,761
Dad would prolong his prayers when I'd go to the Mosque to pray,

39
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,142
Afraid, thinking,

40
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:11,577
'He gets involved in a malefaction whenever he prays'.

41
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:14,548
What would you call a malefaction?

42
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,053
My love, too, is like a malefaction.

43
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:21,884
I feel as if I've committed a cardinal sin.

44
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,320
I'm embarrassed before you too.

45
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,702
I feel I would die of shame

46
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,983
If she came before my eyes.

47
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,500
Then why don't you tell us who writes you letters?

48
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,398
If you love this Farah, why have you kept that Farah's letters?
-I'll tell you one day.

49
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:43,666
You'd be the first one I'd tell...

50
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:47,297
This last bit gets me suspicious,

51
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:52,316
And I'm also afraid to say that she's told a lie.

52
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:57,393
I swear by you she's told the truth.

53
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:03,471
She hasn't written these letters.

54
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:28,679
Pray tell, my dear,

55
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,025
Do I beg forgiveness

56
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,377
On his behalf,

57
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:36,380
Or ask his mother to?

58
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,893
Farah...

59
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,250
You're feeling sorrow now, aren't you?

60
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,846
Yes...

61
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:01,282
Perhaps it's sorrow...

62
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:04,384
Why were you weeping on the way back?

63
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:06,243
I wasn't weeping.

64
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,221
I just got a bit teary-eyed.

65
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,788
You're having pity on him, innit?

66
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,186
I'm having pity on Molvi Sahab.

67
00:06:14,186 --> 00:06:17,590
The good man loves him so much.

68
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,752
Hey!

69
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:23,123
It's still here.

70
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,202
Haven't you sent it for repairing?

71
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:31,891
Talk about him.

72
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,920
I don't even think of him.

73
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,619
But, seeing his family, it seems

74
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,079
He's not that bad.

75
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,579
Did you see the tears in his eyes?

76
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,748
I did.

77
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:46,174
But why did he tear up?

78
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:48,953
Does one cry when one's ashamed of what he's done?

79
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,589
He wasn't ashamed.

80
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:52,294
Not at all.

81
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:54,463
That's what I felt, too.

82
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,220
He stood there firmly

83
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,859
As if he's been wronged!

84
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,305
What nerve

85
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,259
For a trickster

86
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,929
And a con man!

87
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:05,429
Alright, now, forget about him.

88
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,999
Who's crazy enough to remember him?

89
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,829
Molvi Sahab is coming to my mind every now and then.

90
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:12,597
He can't live without him.

91
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,004
Why would he?

92
00:07:14,004 --> 00:07:16,946
He'd forget, as would he, all that happened in a few days.

93
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,561
He [Afzal] won't forget.

94
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,344
He'd remember every single thing.

95
00:07:21,344 --> 00:07:22,789
He'd be afraid

96
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,906
That he may have to face me.

97
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,180
So?

98
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,011
What difference does that make?

99
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:30,621
It doesn't to me.

100
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,275
But it does to Molvi Sahab.

101
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,334
He'd [Afzal] leave Hyderabad.

102
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:37,983
Who told you?

103
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,314
My heart says it.

104
00:07:39,314 --> 00:07:40,487
Shut up, Farah!

105
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:43,615
You've suffered the consequences of your heart's augury many times before

106
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,530
And you are suffering to this day.

107
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,096
I'm honest, Lubna,

108
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:50,391
He won't say in Hyderabad.

109
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,099
He'd leave everyone.

110
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,703
And what if he didn't?

111
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,734
You may proclaim it

112
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:01,363
That the greatest of all fabulists is Farah's heart.

113
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:03,613
An ace fabulist.

114
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,116
When does it depart?

115
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,225
3.15.

116
00:08:17,673 --> 00:08:21,427
Get to the Mosque with a bike by 2.30.

117
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:22,857
Think over it, Afzal,

118
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:25,045
Think over it once more.

119
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,853
There's no further scope for thinking.

120
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,233
I don't know where you've picked this 'scope' from!

121
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:33,050
Now there's 'no scope' for anything to you!

122
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,358
Hey, I can't have a long conversation.

123
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:38,471
It'd be trouble if Arifa overheard it.

124
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,864
Alright.

125
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:43,795
I'll be there on time.

126
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,693
And keep the money in your pocket.

127
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,562
Give it to me at the station.

128
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,091
I've kept it.

129
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:54,083
I'm wandering about with the money in my pocket.

130
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,642
Okay, bye.

131
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,880
Bye.

132
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,810
You're awake.

133
00:10:00,744 --> 00:10:02,081
Yes.

134
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,130
Why?

135
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,526
He hasn't offered his prayers.

136
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,105
He'd said he had,

137
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:20,900
So he must have.

138
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,603
Arifa told me

139
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:26,918
That he was lying.

140
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,289
God forgive!

141
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,336
I'll scold him in the morning.

142
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:36,086
At the very least, he should not lie about his prayers!

143
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:46,698
There are some sleeping pills in the drawer.

144
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:50,303
I'd brought an extra 5mg.

145
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,053
Take one.

146
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:55,027
It'll ease your woes.

147
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,526
I've taken one already.

148
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:01,559
Neither has it eased my woes, nor put me to sleep.

149
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:04,059
You couldn't sleep either?

150
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:13,910
How strange, isn't it, Ruqaiyya, that I've

151
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,423
Never stayed awake like this even for your sorrow.

152
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,834
When have I given you any sorrow?

153
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,471
What was it, if not sorrow,

154
00:11:23,471 --> 00:11:26,580
Four years until the engagement, and four years and three months of separation,

155
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,189
Then, your Dad's order,

156
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,943
'Subhanallah, if you'

157
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,443
'So much as pass through this alley, the engagement's broken'!

158
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,048
I'd bought one of those

159
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:48,138
Little tape recorders back then.

160
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:52,108
In the quiet of the night,

161
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:55,393
I'd secretly listen to one song.

162
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,550
Which one?

163
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:08,901
<i>Where art thou; call out to me,</i>

164
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:17,187
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

165
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:24,783
<i>Call out to me, O where art thou;</i>

166
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,241
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

167
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:39,872
<i>I lie here, wasted,</i>

168
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:47,653
<i>Where dost thou thrive?</i>

169
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,454
<i>Blossometh my youthful, merry world...</i>

170
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,130
Alright, now, that's enough.

171
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:58,686
I'm feeling sleepy.

172
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:01,660
You'd better get some rest too.

173
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,150
Thank you.

174
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,163
She'll be earning her Masters in a month,

175
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:05,058
Send her to pursue her MPhil now.

176
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:06,094
Has she said this?

177
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,459
I've thought of this.

178
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,289
That's brilliant.

179
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,053
Who knows how many years she'll take to earn her MPhil?

180
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,355
Won't she get married?

181
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:14,966
Whom will she marry?

182
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,817
We'll look for a suitable boy.

183
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,253
Let me be very clear, Irsa Begum, that I'm not sending the lass to London all alone.

184
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,261
The pursuit of knowledge is dear to me, too,

185
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,866
But honour is dearer to me.

186
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,398
She'll not agree to any one, Monseigneur.

187
00:14:29,398 --> 00:14:31,141
Why wouldn't she?

188
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,471
Are there no good lads left in the world?

189
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,974
She'll definitely like someone.

190
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,416
She won't like anyone.

191
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,874
She'll spend quite a few years to conclude

192
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:44,247
That nobody can possibly be better than Afzal.

193
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:46,494
Let her go.

194
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:48,188
She's no longer alone.

195
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,726
When a girl starts thinking about someone,

196
00:14:50,726 --> 00:14:53,249
She's no longer alone.

197
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,073
So what says your augurer of a heart?

198
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:16,413
When will he leave?

199
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,089
Tonight.

200
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:24,514
Who knows when he'll return to Hyderabad...

201
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:26,982
If what you say turns out to be true,

202
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,382
I swear I'll have you perform exorcism

203
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,138
And make me amulets all my life.

204
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:36,309
Call Arifa in a while and ask her

205
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,583
Where her brother is.

206
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,691
She'll say that he's in his room, sleeping.

207
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,262
Say, then,

208
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:45,878
'Go and check'.

209
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,364
She'd find out, as would you,

210
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,614
When she'd check.

211
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:55,076
What's the time?

212
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,343
2.20.

213
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,610
He'd be about to leave.

214
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,283
Call and ask at a quarter to three.

215
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:13,033
She'll check and tell you that he's left.

216
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,444
Get going.

217
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:41,101
Didn't I tell you to get a move on?

218
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:43,840
There's no scope for stopping to look back.

219
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,504
C'mon.

220
00:22:26,575 --> 00:22:28,463
What's the time?

221
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,753
It's almost 3.

222
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,419
Call Arifa.

223
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,917
Call her, will you?

224
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:42,667
Ask her where her brother is.

225
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,107
Call her; I'm being honest!

226
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:48,107
He's left.

227
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:16,178
Hello?

228
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,836
Lubna here.

229
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:20,359
Everything's alright, isn't it?

230
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:22,325
It is over here,

231
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:25,451
Check and tell me if everything's good there.

232
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:28,049
Yes, everything's good.

233
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,421
Where's Afzal?

234
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:33,577
In his room?

235
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,741
Go and check,

236
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:38,204
See if he's actually in his room, sleeping.

237
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:39,500
What do you mean?

238
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,538
I'll tell you what I mean later.

239
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:46,038
For now, stay on the line, go to his room, and tell me if he's there.

240
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:00,059
Afzal!

241
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,189
Afzal?

242
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,328
Afzal!

243
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,252
He --

244
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:18,222
He's not in his room, Lubna.

245
00:24:18,543 --> 00:24:21,072
He's gone, Arifa.

246
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:24,465
He's left Hyderabad.

247
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,640
Who told you?

248
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,036
Farah.

249
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:33,795
Has he told Farah?

250
00:24:34,602 --> 00:24:37,849
Farah's heart has told her.

251
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,978
Thank you, mate.

252
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:06,153
My train's here.

253
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:08,027
You may go now.

254
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,125
Afzal,

255
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,943
If you can somehow see some scope for it on the way, turn back, will you?

256
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:23,468
Please.

257
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,520
If you're vexed with someone, leave it be.

258
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,840
If you're obdurate, don't be.

259
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,688
I'm vexed with myself,

260
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:35,064
Obdurate against fate.

261
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:36,546
I'll die

262
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:39,345
Of disgrace here;

263
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:41,453
If forced to return,

264
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,730
I'd rather drown in the ocean.

265
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,870
As they say,

266
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,870
The waters of shame are deeper than the oceans.

267
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:15,634
You are awake

268
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:18,165
And having tea.

269
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,639
What is going on?

270
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,102
Why don't you have some, too?

271
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,153
Sit.

272
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,664
Take a two or three sips first.

273
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,560
As you command.

274
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:38,989
God is the Greatest.

275
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,470
May you live long.

276
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:10,139
That's three sips there.

277
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:11,985
Tell me, now.

278
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:19,351
Mum's asleep, right?

279
00:29:19,351 --> 00:29:21,125
Fast asleep.

280
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:25,073
The biddy's taken a stronger dose than 5mg.

281
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:28,986
She'll wake up just in time to make up for missed prayers!

282
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:32,626
That's very good.

283
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,280
Why is it good?

284
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,293
Here.

285
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:57,469
Afzal's written it?

286
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,458
Yes.

287
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,260
He's left?

288
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:54,009
Just one blighter

289
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:57,431
Among one's sons

290
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:00,901
Can kill; that scallywag!

291
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,670
You --

292
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,787
He had some money with him, didn't he?

293
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:29,365
Well, one need not worry about that.

294
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:32,258
As per his last known whereabouts,

295
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:35,286
He was playing a cricket match at night.

296
00:31:35,286 --> 00:31:37,485
Let's just say

297
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:40,901
That, as he left,

298
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:45,102
He's gambled there, too.

299
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:39,410
She's sleeping without a worry.

300
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,349
The pill's got the power!

301
00:32:42,632 --> 00:32:47,174
The wretch can make a mother doze off like that, too!

302
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,652
But you'd better stay awake.

303
00:32:51,652 --> 00:32:54,306
I'll lead the prayers

304
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:58,328
And think about a solution for when she's awake.

305
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:00,640
Keep a close watch.

306
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,463
If she wakes up,

307
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,463
Don't tell her what roused you.

308
00:33:24,276 --> 00:33:30,098
<i>Who were those people</i>

309
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:35,353
<i>Who won their love?</i>

310
00:33:35,353 --> 00:33:41,145
<i>Who were those people</i>

311
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:46,495
<i>Who won their love?</i>

312
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:51,635
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

313
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:58,026
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

314
00:33:58,026 --> 00:34:03,556
<i>Who were those people</i>

315
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:08,883
<i>Who won their love?</i>

316
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:11,000
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

317
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,283
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

318
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:16,832
If necessary, you'd stand firm before Dad in saying,

319
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:21,156
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

320
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:25,023
<i>Every compeer I found</i>

321
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:30,265
<i>Doubled my heart's grief</i>

322
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,456
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

323
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:41,544
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

324
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:47,361
<i>Who were those people</i>

325
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:53,004
<i>Who won their love?</i>

326
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:29,273
Just keep on loving me,

327
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,703
So much

328
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:32,580
That beholders and earwiggers

329
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,646
Die of envy!

330
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:38,093
Must I be perfidious?

331
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:40,405
There's no other option!

332
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:43,938
We may just be parted...

333
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:02,983
Hey!

334
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:03,932
Oi!

335
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:06,022
Get your leg out of the way!

336
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:09,509
Ych a fi!

337
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,737
Would you look at that, Mam!

338
00:35:10,737 --> 00:35:12,330
How he's staring back!

339
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,367
Push him aside!

340
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:14,534
Get aside!

341
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:16,957
Look at him staring wide-eyed!

342
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,830
It's you, Molvi Sahab!

343
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,349
And upon you, peace.

344
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:14,866
You'll have to come.

345
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:16,306
Right now?

346
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,315
Yes.

347
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:18,549
What happened?

348
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:20,271
Come along, will you?

349
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:21,426
I'll be coming in a minute.

350
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:23,431
Listen, Doctor...

351
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,604
Bring all the heart medicines you have.

352
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:27,960
Has someone had a heart attack?

353
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,409
God forbid, no!

354
00:36:30,409 --> 00:36:32,953
Just do as I say.

355
00:36:32,953 --> 00:36:34,953
Alright, I'm coming.

356
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,750
O Lord, grant me peace...

357
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,688
Arifa!

358
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:06,226
Arifa!

359
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:08,472
Yes, Mum?

360
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,387
You darted here so quickly!

361
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:14,348
Have I never called out to you before?

362
00:37:14,348 --> 00:37:16,012
Anyway,

363
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:17,154
Where's your Dad?

364
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,507
He'll be coming shortly.

365
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:21,016
He would be, but where's he gone?

366
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:24,193
His prayers would've ended at 5.15.

367
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,139
Anyway,

368
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,524
What about your brother?

369
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:32,905
Has he asked for some tea or breakfast?

370
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:36,902
Or does he lay shamefaced, sleeping?

371
00:37:37,706 --> 00:37:40,282
Who can fall asleep shamefaced?

372
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:42,782
The poor soul must be awake.

373
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:47,747
May my hands break.

374
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,638
I'd hit him so hard.

375
00:37:50,638 --> 00:37:53,365
His jaw must be paining.

376
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:55,964
Ask him how he is.

377
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:59,971
Give the poor lad something to eat and tell him to get some sleep.

378
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:14,150
What would you like to have?

379
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,422
Tea or coffee?

380
00:38:15,422 --> 00:38:17,800
Don't ask about tea or coffee in an emergency,

381
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,808
Just bring the patient, Molvi Sahab.

382
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,035
Dad...

383
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,216
She's up.

384
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:25,746
She's only asking about him ever since she got up.

385
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,593
Sit firm here, Doctor.

386
00:38:28,593 --> 00:38:32,199
Keep the medicines ready.

387
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:36,986
Medicines for what, I should know first...

388
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:39,414
Have some tea.

389
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:42,346
I'll get you some in a minute.

390
00:38:58,774 --> 00:39:00,834
Who's the honourable visitor?

391
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,036
He's

392
00:39:02,036 --> 00:39:04,586
The good old Doctor.

393
00:39:04,586 --> 00:39:06,803
The Doctor?

394
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,539
You're mentioning him as if

395
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:13,851
Mentioning him forebodes no danger.

396
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,911
Now that he's here, serve him some tea before he leaves.

397
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:19,540
Else, the folks in the neighbourhood will keep on asking until the night,

398
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,738
'Is everything alright'?

399
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:21,868
'What happened'?

400
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:26,614
'Who's so sick that you had to call the Doctor home'?
-Would you please shut up, Ruqaiyya Begum?

401
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,760
Going on and on for no reason!

402
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,355
The door's shut, isn't it?

403
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:35,709
Not a sound goes out of this room when this door is shut.

404
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:39,399
Don't you remember when I'd gone to watch a film with Nusrat?

405
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,769
We had a row in this very room.

406
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:44,584
How ferociously you roared!

407
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:48,117
But not a mouse stirred outside!

408
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,898
May I sit?

409
00:39:49,898 --> 00:39:51,384
There, now.

410
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:54,026
You'd ask permission of me to sit now?

411
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:55,964
And why would you sit?

412
00:39:55,964 --> 00:40:01,218
Have forgotten the good Doctor sitting out there?

413
00:40:01,218 --> 00:40:02,231
My Afzal!

414
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,881
He's alright, isn't he?

415
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,770
Yes, he's --

416
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:08,117
He's alright.

417
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:09,667
Sit down.

418
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,038
Sit...

419
00:40:13,866 --> 00:40:15,929
If...

420
00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:19,910
If you are tormented like this,

421
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,726
It'd be a great difficulty for me.

422
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:28,212
This lordly wont of yours of whacking him,

423
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:31,479
Get this out of yourself!

424
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:34,994
Your son's a young man.

425
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,366
And he's --

426
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,100
Out of control, at that.

427
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,933
What if, one of these days,

428
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:43,677
He went astray?

429
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,427
So?

430
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,148
You've forgotten already!

431
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:49,503
He threatens us

432
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:51,169
With his departure

433
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:53,205
From here!

434
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:55,537
Should I yield to his threats?

435
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,438
It won't be this way, Molvi Sahab,

436
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,674
If he does something wrong,

437
00:40:58,674 --> 00:40:59,905
I'll whack him.

438
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:02,640
Right, then, stand firm on your intentions!

439
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,396
But remember, also,

440
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:07,293
That it won't be like this every time.

441
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:09,743
One of these days, you'll wake up

442
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:15,137
To the news that he's boarded the 3.15 a.m. train and left!

443
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
