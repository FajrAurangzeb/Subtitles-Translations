1
00:00:07,917 --> 00:00:13,746
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:18,949
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:24,056
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:30,306
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:36,046
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:40,636
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:32,906
Splendid.

8
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:35,861
So to speak, she's getting married, and not getting married.

9
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,262
It's a marriage for one and not for the other.

10
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:41,621
Does she really love someone else?

11
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,541
No.

12
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:45,581
She was lying about the letters and the calls.

13
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,078
What do you mean?

14
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:49,512
She just said it casually that she loves someone else.

15
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:50,841
God forgive!

16
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,651
Ask why she said it.

17
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:55,092
Why did she said it?
-To raise an issue of honour.

18
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,701
It's been raised.

19
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:57,955
Not like that.

20
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,205
He was delighted to hear it.

21
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,432
He said,

22
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:03,594
'I have begun to admire you even more'.

23
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:05,121
'I'm proud of you'.

24
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:09,365
'Unlike other girls, you didn't conceal your past from me'.

25
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, so that's why the date has been decided.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
But when the date's been fixed, how can she not get married?

28
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:20,029
You don't know her.

29
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,059
I know her.

30
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:23,830
When she's said she'd embitter us with these sweets,

31
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,480
She must mean it!

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,341
But

33
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,031
It's only four months until December.

34
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,810
And when I said this,

35
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,220
She said that this year will have 11 months,

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,510
Where will there be room for December?

37
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,660
Mum!

38
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:42,591
Keep the door open.

39
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,031
Your laughter would resonate downstairs.

40
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,312
Where's your brother, the loafer?

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,422
Have some shame.

42
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,262
Would you call him a loafer now?

43
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,732
What has he done now?

44
00:02:57,732 --> 00:03:00,392
You're saying as if you don't know.

45
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,592
I swear by you, I don't.

46
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,136
He's not gone, is he?

47
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,605
He's gotten a job!

48
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,823
That's great!

49
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:11,843
You don't know, your father has hired him in the accounts department at the mill.

50
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:12,890
Oh?

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,790
Left wearing a tie,

52
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,690
A fine, sharp dressed gentleman!

53
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,060
I swear, he looked fabulous!

54
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:23,189
Sometimes, I feel he should've been born in a family like yours.

55
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,928
He'd wear dazzling suits,

56
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,437
Shining boots,

57
00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:28,587
A hundred kinds of ties...

58
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,377
Travel in a luxury car,

59
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,847
Attend royal parties near and far,

60
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,281
Have a ball of a time.

61
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,347
But anyway,

62
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,437
Thank God

63
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:36,897
He's got a job today,

64
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,167
He'll prosper tomorrow.

65
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,377
We'll have a car too,

66
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,127
Then I'll talk to you.

67
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:43,597
Talk to me -- what?

68
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:45,627
I mean I'd then show it off, dear!

69
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:47,127
We'll definitely come across,

70
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,087
Right around the lane with the Mosque,

71
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:51,297
Your car from one end, ours from the other,

72
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,527
I'd blow the horn and say,

73
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:55,047
'Move aside, my good man'!

74
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:57,267
Surely, you --

75
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,017
Don't mind?

76
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,258
Not at all.

77
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:03,987
Dad used to be a supervisor in a cotton mill.

78
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:06,787
He travelled seven miles on a bicycle.

79
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,847
He'll find prosperity too, one day.

80
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,877
Cars, mansions - he'll get all he wants.

81
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:14,207
But tell him surely

82
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,909
To mind his character.

83
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,267
Prosperity won't be far that way.

84
00:04:20,987 --> 00:04:21,987
And

85
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,018
Here comes my security detail.

86
00:04:28,657 --> 00:04:30,397
I'll take my leave.

87
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:32,916
Bye!

88
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,130
Yes, Babloo?

89
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,549
Take it for 20.

90
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,769
20?

91
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,671
Not a penny more than this.

92
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:54,909
Look, Babloo.

93
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not that kind of Afzal anymore.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,419
I've gotten a job.

95
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,869
A job that does not allow me to answer calls.

96
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,608
Look ahead

97
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,477
What's before me?

98
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:15,748
My boss Mr Chengezi is staring at me with his eyes ablaze.

99
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,547
He face doesn't redden with rage,

100
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:20,187
It blackens.

101
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,258
Look, Babloo.

102
00:05:21,258 --> 00:05:22,468
Forget me.

103
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,858
I'm developing a habit of living on my salary.

104
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,868
You and --

105
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,317
Don't use a four letter word!

106
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,697
I can't hit you back with one.

107
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,979
Because

108
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,007
On the seat next to mine sits a sweet lady.

109
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,060
Alright, disconnect.

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,064
You bugger!

111
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:43,160
You're the worst dastard.

112
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:45,339
Foul words!

113
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:49,340
Tell me

114
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,513
What did you do before you becoming an accountant?

115
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,300
What would I do?

116
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,910
Loafing around or

117
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,550
Bulldozing around.

118
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,391
But sir

119
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:04,239
I'm not that old Afzal.

120
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,469
If someone looked at me like this then,

121
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,131
The way you are now,

122
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,720
I swear by you, I'd have clawed his eyes out.

123
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,631
But sir,

124
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,841
Boss is boss.

125
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,014
I've accepted you as mine.

126
00:06:19,014 --> 00:06:23,725
Although in all honesty, you're doing such things as made me want to --

127
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,711
What?

128
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:27,724
Leave it, sir.

129
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,541
You should accept it too.

130
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,181
I'm not the old Afzal.

131
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,127
What'll people think?

132
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:20,846
What will they think?

133
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:25,877
Such a friendship since Day 1 that Rosy drove Afzal home?

134
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,942
Who cares?

135
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,486
Honestly though,

136
00:07:29,486 --> 00:07:31,137
Why this inconvenience?

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,520
My home isn't too far.

138
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,202
It's not too far to you.

139
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,100
Won't you be away if you go?

140
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:45,026
I think you're right.

141
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,806
But please,

142
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,769
Drop me at a slight distance.

143
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,803
At a distance?
-It's the neighbourhood.

144
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:54,853
Someone might think something wrong about you.

145
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,610
Mate, you're a man and yet you're afraid?

146
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,400
I'm not a man...

147
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,690
W-- What?

148
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,830
I mean

149
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,550
I'm not afraid.

150
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,250
But it's that women's honour is delicate

151
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,517
I just care about that.

152
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,999
Straight ahead from here.

153
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,276
Excuse me.

154
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:25,016
Yes, Babloo?

155
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:27,077
It's 6.15, you bugger.

156
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,426
Not again?

157
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:30,900
Does 20 grand not make your mouth water?

158
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,548
It does, old chap, but --

159
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,126
A word's a word.

160
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:36,076
I've given Dad my word.

161
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:39,387
Alright -- Let's seal it for 25.

162
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:40,767
25?

163
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,548
Turn around.

164
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:45,957
Turn around? Okay...

165
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:47,500
Mr 'Turn around'!

166
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,597
I'll give you 30.

167
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:50,030
And if that's not acceptable,

168
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,321
Bugger off!

169
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,418
Turn around again.

170
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:02,832
Now,

171
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:03,972
Stop here.

172
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,642
Stop it, stop it!
-What?

173
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,820
Yes, I'm coming.

174
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,946
Leave me here, I'll get a rickshaw from around here.

175
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,290
Mum!

176
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:22,297
It's him - Afzal!

177
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,976
The loafer!

178
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,020
Where'd he get a car from?

179
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,719
A girl is sitting in the car; she's driving.

180
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:34,440
She might be injured or something...

181
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,640
Oh God...

182
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,740
Look at him

183
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,210
He's left the girl here.

184
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,321
Cap'n!

185
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,701
Afzal's here.

186
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,680
The bugger.

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,781
If he hadn't come now, there would've been no gambling left in the world.

188
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,361
I like it.

189
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,451
What?

190
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:28,180
When there's a match outside the colony, Dad can't possibly know.

191
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,031
Don't drag your Dad into this.

192
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,404
You've got to win us the match.

193
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:33,170
Consider it done.

194
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,251
Modi,

195
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,612
Get the stuff ready.

196
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,206
You saw Afzal with your own eyes?

197
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:45,992
Of course.

198
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:49,592
Saw him get out of the car and run away in a rickshaw!

199
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:53,162
And you saw that he was with a girl?

200
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,041
You and your questions.

201
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,991
I took the same girl to the doctor.

202
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,651
Do you know who she is?

203
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,911
Who?

204
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,951
Works in the accounts department at our mill.

205
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,132
Rosy.

206
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,582
Rosy?

207
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,271
I thought the blighter wanted to earn a living [= rozi].

208
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,782
He's not going to change.

209
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:12,762
What's your concern if he changes?

210
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,922
He's my friend's brother.

211
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,222
Everyone's got his eyes on him.

212
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:18,672
The poor girl

213
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,923
All her dreams are because of him.

214
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,911
I'd gone to give her the sweets,

215
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:25,231
When she told me it's his first day at the office.

216
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,692
He's got a job at the accounts department of our mill.

217
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:28,931
Wow.

218
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:30,301
A job at the accounts,

219
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:32,571
And a fiddle on the first day!

220
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:34,928
Fiddle?
-What else is it?

221
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,989
Got the accounts officer head over heels for him on the first day.

222
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:39,188
And you

223
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,158
Why have you given her sweets?

224
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,438
Won't sweets be distributed now that the date's been fixed?

225
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,409
Mum asked me to go to Molvi Sahab's first.

226
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,898
He'll have some and give his blessings.

227
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:52,568
Oh God... Help me!

228
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,258
Splendid!

229
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,819
You bugger!

230
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:29,092
Who'll score runs for us if you let them score so many?

231
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,150
Come to form.

232
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,819
Alright.

233
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,430
Easy there!

234
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:45,044
Yes!

235
00:12:45,268 --> 00:12:46,726
Great!

236
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,999
Where'd he go on a rickshaw?

237
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:29,380
What do I know?

238
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,229
He must've been headed home the way he ran.

239
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,984
He isn't here.

240
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,430
He's not even answering the phone.

241
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,651
Why would he?

242
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:38,321
He must have another one somewhere?

243
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,261
Another -- what?

244
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:42,071
Do I have to tell you?

245
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,921
Keep on remembering God.

246
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,272
Ignore God's infinite mercy on your brother.

247
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:48,511
Wait.

248
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,132
I'll find out.

249
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,431
My maid's son Alladio

250
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,462
Yes?

251
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:55,101
He knows everything.

252
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,824
Alright, I'll wait.

253
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:58,821
Please ask him and tell me.

254
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
Okay, bye.

255
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,151
Hey

256
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,541
Please win us this match.

257
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,821
I've borrowed 50,000 --
-How do I win this?

258
00:14:57,821 --> 00:15:00,091
65 runs in 4 overs...

259
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,153
Do something.

260
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,584
Let me see...

261
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,020
Where is he?

262
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,659
Playing a match in the old colony.

263
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,549
Gambling over it?

264
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,987
20 more in 1 over...

265
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,270
It's all on you now.

266
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,717
Why's everything on me, you bugger?

267
00:16:10,717 --> 00:16:12,627
Have I ever scored 20 in 1 over?

268
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:13,796
I swear

269
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:14,998
Go for the sixes, Afzal.

270
00:16:14,998 --> 00:16:16,436
That I will, Babloo...

271
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,336
Will try my best.

272
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:19,546
You are under her oath

273
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,046
Whose?

274
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,377
The one who writes you letters.

275
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:54,857
What was that, you bugger?

276
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:56,747
Don't you love her?

277
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,806
Look,

278
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,417
We can win only if you hit a six.

279
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,590
Please, mate.

280
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,119
Hit one.

281
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,654
Leave it be!

282
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,176
Right, show me the dough.

283
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:10,292
Yes.

284
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,327
Right here.

285
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,520
Look, I've

286
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,721
Found him.

287
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:27,780
I've brought him home.

288
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,469
When I arrived there, the match

289
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,209
Was going on with vigour.

290
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:37,746
Ruqaiyya, I swear, if you had been by my side,

291
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:41,066
You'd have sunken into the earth out of disgrace.

292
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,316
Labouring devotedly like an ox at an oil mill was our Afzal

293
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,876
His guts haggard,

294
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:50,486
But resolve firm.

295
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:53,855
You kept on asking,

296
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,546
And she,

297
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,275
His sister, but empoisoned my ears,

298
00:20:58,356 --> 00:20:59,685
That my son

299
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,875
Gambles.

300
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,945
God forgive! God forgive!

301
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,830
You, blear-eyed,

302
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,829
View pouring blood, toil, and sweat,

303
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:15,889
And striving for a victory as gambling?

304
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,710
Look at him.

305
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,431
This.

306
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,861
30,000 Rupees.

307
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,221
He's earned it.

308
00:21:28,641 --> 00:21:30,863
On every banknote

309
00:21:30,863 --> 00:21:35,141
You can see my Afzal's blood and sweat if only you'd look!

310
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:39,370
Step out of the house and see

311
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,790
Look at your son's trials and tribulations!

312
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,570
Listen to the praise of his good name echo!

313
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,321
You'll realise, then,

314
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,680
Our Afzal juggles two jobs at the same time.

315
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,020
Yes.

316
00:21:55,676 --> 00:21:56,926
Hey!

317
00:21:57,676 --> 00:21:59,446
Why are you standing?

318
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,676
Sit down, son.

319
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:02,306
Sit down.

320
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:06,639
My son, you...

321
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,829
You're standing as if you've done something wrong.

322
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,112
I'm the one who's been wrong, son.

323
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,219
I listened to them and to God...

324
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:20,269
Remained too preoccupied with the Mosque and prayers...

325
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:24,530
And didn't shave off this beard [abandon all of this] and go along with you.

326
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,279
Now, I will.

327
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,469
I will go with you now.

328
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:33,470
For the first time, someone else has given the call,

329
00:22:33,544 --> 00:22:36,710
And I don't know

330
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:39,879
Who's led the prayers.

331
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,249
Enough of it all!

332
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,919
Enough of doing God's work.

333
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,410
My Afzal [excellent one] has outvied me!

334
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:54,500
Earns what he likes when he likes...

335
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,169
Without the obligations of his five prayers with purity,

336
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,442
Nor the pain of bowing and obsecrating again and again.

337
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:06,421
I will go with you now.

338
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:07,690
Do you know, when you,

339
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,452
So openly

340
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:15,272
Collected your money, how much it hurt me?

341
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:18,600
Such overt and unashamed

342
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,437
Gambling is not proper.

343
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,940
Now, when I'll be with you,

344
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,831
There --

345
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:28,180
Will be some secrecy.

346
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,190
You

347
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,480
Can play your match, and

348
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,680
I will take the money.

349
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:37,427
Hey?

350
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:40,977
What are you looking at?

351
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:44,748
Get him something to eat.

352
00:23:44,748 --> 00:23:46,849
Feed him well,

353
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,138
Regale him.

354
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,767
Take this.

355
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:05,357
From today, this responsibility, too,

356
00:24:05,357 --> 00:24:08,400
I leave in your hands.

357
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:13,287
Just think as if

358
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,537
Molvi Subhanallah is dead!

359
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,110
The wretch has been ensepulchred beneath the sweet redolence of banknotes!

360
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,460
Stop, Molvi Sahab.

361
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,670
I swear by my love and purity.

362
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,740
Put on this turban,

363
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,174
And throw this wastrel out of the house.

364
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,020
I, too, proclaim today -

365
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,371
'The righteous and the sinful cannot live under one roof'.

366
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:16,666
Get out of here, you blighter!

367
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:21,666
I will take it as if I'd given you birth for the times,

368
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:24,806
Raised you, and handed you to the times.

369
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,896
Get out! Out!

370
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:30,757
Before my motherly affection surrenders before your sins!

371
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:33,026
Pick up your things from here,

372
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,927
And begone forever!

373
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:37,576
Out of my sights!

374
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:39,197
Go!
-Stop --

375
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,157
Stop it, Ruqaiyya.

376
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:42,487
Stop it.

377
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:46,927
It is not my desire to separate a mother from her son.

378
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:51,039
Tell him to stay here,

379
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,090
And keep on causing me misery.

380
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,070
Now, if I

381
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,980
Separate a mother from her son,

382
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,560
Will God be pleased with me?

383
00:26:07,272 --> 00:26:10,329
I'm faced with a difficulty on either side.

384
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:13,672
Don't turn away and leave, Molvi Sahab.

385
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,199
Exercise your authority as a father.

386
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,889
Whack him.

387
00:26:19,396 --> 00:26:21,416
Slap him so hard

388
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:24,256
That the pain of it stings at him forever.

389
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:31,906
You're accosting my helplessness.

390
00:26:31,964 --> 00:26:35,366
You should at least know so much

391
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:40,775
That seeing the son's temerity

392
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:45,206
Has brought tears to the father's eyes.

393
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:50,876
The courage to slap is not left in him.

394
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,650
Let him rot in here.

395
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,022
Do not proclaim greatness before fate.

396
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:04,569
For the crime of living under the same roof as him,

397
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:06,660
I shall offer

398
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,300
Two prayers of forgiveness.

399
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,040
Then, let us see what God wills.

400
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,880
Perhaps

401
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:19,520
Out of this pain,

402
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:23,440
He will become faithful!

403
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,606
Don't worry, my dear, your name won't come up.

404
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:49,816
Forget that you said something that I heard.

405
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:51,983
Oh God!

406
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,757
What happened, sister?

407
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,923
I told his sister

408
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,900
Mentioned your name too...

409
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,740
Disconnect the phone, quick!

410
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,320
I'm dead then, sister!

411
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,271
You won't die.

412
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,650
Disconnect. I'll ask his sister not to name you in front of him.

413
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:24,658
Hello?

414
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:25,988
Has he been caught?

415
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:28,678
Yes.

416
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:33,912
Talk about Alladio...

417
00:28:33,952 --> 00:28:35,302
Oh yes --

418
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:36,402
Please,

419
00:28:36,452 --> 00:28:39,342
Don't tell him Alladio ratted him out.

420
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,192
The poor chap's getting worried.

421
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:43,102
I won't.

422
00:28:43,158 --> 00:28:44,602
What happened to your voice?

423
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:47,012
You haven't even thanked me.

424
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:48,622
Thank you.

425
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:51,872
But I request you, Lubna,

426
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,340
If you get wind of something like this again,

427
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,953
Please don't tell me.

428
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,876
Go now; she's said she won't tell him.

429
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,601
Thank you.

430
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:09,990
What won't she tell?

431
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,380
And who won't tell?

432
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:13,387
You'll be delighted to hear.

433
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,017
The loafer Afzal --

434
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,307
Arifa's brother --

435
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:17,388
Yes?

436
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,357
I've had him nicked.

437
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,747
Nicked?

438
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:22,977
He was gambling on a match outside the colony.

439
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,797
I called Arifa and told her,

440
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,637
And I've come to know Molvi Sahab's caught him in a raid.

441
00:29:27,637 --> 00:29:29,417
Are you in your senses?

442
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,807
What have you got to do with him?

443
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:32,437
Something, certainly.

444
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,937
He works at our mill,

445
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:36,227
He's got the accounts officer head over heels for him,

446
00:29:36,227 --> 00:29:37,887
That gives us a lot to do with him.

447
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:39,700
Now, just watch -

448
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,637
Molvi Sahab will skin him alive.

449
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:43,528
Beware!

450
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,127
What 'beware'?

451
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,003
Don't even mention his name!

452
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:48,578
Given that he's Arifa's brother,

453
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,189
Molvi Sahab's son,

454
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:54,172
But I despise the sound of his name from your mouth.

455
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:56,479
He's an A1 loafer --

456
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,577
And gambler.

457
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:58,527
Right...

458
00:29:58,527 --> 00:29:59,967
Why do you despise it?

459
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,557
I say, to the dickens with him,

460
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:03,607
It's not as if I'm having an affair with him.

461
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:07,057
Arifa had pleaded before me, so I thought I'd ask Alladio.

462
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,697
What do I know him?

463
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:12,007
I turn away if I come across him.

464
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,227
Stop talking about him!

465
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,135
Why are you crying now?

466
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,807
I'm wicked, am I not?

467
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:41,053
Yes.

468
00:30:41,053 --> 00:30:42,813
You're wicked.

469
00:30:43,307 --> 00:30:45,927
You made Dad cry.

470
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,764
Now, even a lifetime of weeping

471
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,927
Cannot possibly recompense those tears.

472
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,177
Listen.

473
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:58,470
Remember this

474
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,284
I'll spend my lifetime weeping,

475
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,794
And find peace only when I have recompensed those tears.

476
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:11,184
I'm serving the food; come and have some.

477
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,924
I'll die of hunger but not have a bite.

478
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,560
I went to the office,

479
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,520
Having decided

480
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,929
That I won't gamble again.

481
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,780
But that blighter Babloo --

482
00:31:33,635 --> 00:31:38,215
Kept on calling, and I kept telling him that I won't play.

483
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:44,119
But --

484
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,809
I fell for the lure of 30,000.

485
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,750
He's not a blighter,

486
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,789
I'm the blighter!

487
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,780
If I'd the slightest hint

488
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,300
That Dad would cry like this if he came to know,

489
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:15,437
I'd never have played.

490
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:19,067
I swear by you.

491
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:24,246
If you think

492
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:28,320
I'm lying under my oath by you,

493
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,826
Then I'm not wicked,

494
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,186
I'm the most vile and dastardly.

495
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:35,326
Alright...

496
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,295
Have something to eat...

497
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,700
I'll talk to Dad if you have some food.

498
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,110
I've never given an assurance,

499
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,949
My heart says that he'll forgive you.

500
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,150
I'll have something.

501
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:38,790
Give us our lives, O Gracious Lord, in Your Surrender, and admit into the Safety of Your Peace.

502
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,410
You come with an endorsement?

503
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,030
I've come to assure you.

504
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,580
He swore by my head for the first time.

505
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:09,380
I swear today that he won't gamble again.

506
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,189
He won't smoke cigarettes or weed.

507
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:15,922
He'll be honest and principled in his work.

508
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:19,640
He was weeping because you had shed tears.

509
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,749
I'd said that even a lifetime of weeping cannot possibly recompense Dad's tears.

510
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,760
To which he said,

511
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,700
'I'll weep all my life'

512
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,840
'But find peace only when I have atoned for them'.

513
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:36,731
Will he pray?

514
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:38,875
We'll know at daybreak.

515
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:42,264
Just forgive him. Don't strike a deal.

516
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,976
I forgive him.

517
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:57,238
Come on. Have dinner with him.

518
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,040
With that unfaithful liar!

519
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,110
With that newly faithful.

520
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:17,786
I have agreed to what you've said.

521
00:36:18,371 --> 00:36:20,636
But remember

522
00:36:21,307 --> 00:36:23,387
He'll finish you off as well

523
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:25,727
Where there'll not be the slightest relief. Yes.

524
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,450
Hey, Afzal!

525
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,545
You bugger!

526
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,791
I heard you won 30,000 yesterday?

527
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,710
You'll earn the bucks and not tell me?

528
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,420
Hey, Afzal!

529
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,560
It's him.

530
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,253
Whatever his character may be like,

531
00:37:37,253 --> 00:37:39,640
You got to admit he's got those looks!

532
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:54,706
Hey!

533
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,517
What happened to your head?

534
00:37:57,296 --> 00:37:58,726
Got injured.

535
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:02,606
Your heart was injured and you've bandaged your head?

536
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,980
It's a real one, I suppose?

537
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:11,040
I've had an accident, sir.

538
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,452
That was bound to happen.

539
00:38:12,452 --> 00:38:15,160
Let's see where it's struck him.

540
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,653
Excuse me, sir?

541
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:20,251
There's no costing or budgeting in love.

542
00:38:20,481 --> 00:38:23,651
You never know how much you may end up spending.

543
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:26,091
It must've cost 10,000.

544
00:38:26,091 --> 00:38:27,291
What?

545
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:29,211
Getting the car repaired, what else?

546
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:31,792
Not at all. It's only cost 2,500.

547
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:35,011
So to speak, the first meeting cost you 2,500.
-Good morning! Good morning, sir!

548
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:37,152
Good morning... Morning, Sir!

549
00:38:37,152 --> 00:38:40,033
'Morning. Very good morning.

550
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:43,232
I don't see you injured?

551
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:46,152
Or is it that you've been hurt on the inside?

552
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,360
Miss Rosy?

553
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,420
What happened to you?

554
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,187
You got injured?

555
00:38:58,807 --> 00:38:59,949
Yes.

556
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:04,727
But how?

557
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:06,917
You were fine in the evening.

558
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:09,797
It's in the evening that I had the accident.

559
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:13,697
A car hit me from behind when I was taking a U-turn!

560
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:18,946
You may leave.

561
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,540
Would you happen to have a pen?

562
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,666
I'd like some tea.

563
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:47,950
