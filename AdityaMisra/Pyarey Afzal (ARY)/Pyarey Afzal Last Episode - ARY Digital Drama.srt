1
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:13,656
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:18,786
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:24,046
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:30,203
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:36,043
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:40,483
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,048
Don't you feel ashamed to think

8
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,029
That she loves you, and she's searching for the one

9
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,078
Whom you love?

10
00:01:28,897 --> 00:01:30,047
Come.

11
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,677
Come on, mate.

12
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:38,224
You'd started going down the path of God, so where have you ended up?

13
00:01:39,854 --> 00:01:41,804
Nowhere.

14
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:48,094
You'd just left Hyderabad and ended up in Karachi.

15
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:54,041
And here you are, thinking whether

16
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,210
You've never left Hyderabad,

17
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,900
Or never returned from Karachi.

18
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,119
How are you, Mr Fiancé?

19
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,730
Come inside.

20
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:40,738
I saw you playing cricket.

21
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,928
You're such an ace, mate!

22
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:45,399
Don't say 'mate;' Dad may hear it!

23
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,649
These are mere parting discourtesies, my dear;

24
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,102
Then, who knows what may become of me

25
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,759
And you?

26
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,160
Tell him to not look at me with such fury!

27
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,820
Don't look at her with such fury!

28
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,736
Why did you go there?

29
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,077
Eh?

30
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:18,260
For the sake of Molvi Uncle's coconut biscuits.

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,011
Please agree to what I'm saying!

32
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,710
And for your Mum's sake.

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,800
She sees your image in Farah.

34
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,017
And for your sake, Afzal Sir,

35
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:51,449
For I see her in your eyes.

36
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,150
It occurred to me that you'd gotten engaged for my happiness,

37
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:06,136
For your happiness, then, I thought I'd break this engagement.

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,179
Uncle, tell him

39
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,130
To return my ring.

40
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,056
You're under my oath!

41
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,230
What are you saying?

42
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,177
Please, Yasmin.

43
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,457
Don't say such things...

44
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,117
I've made a promise to Molvi Sahab,

45
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,457
And you're so one-sided -

46
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:11,091
You agree to everything the Coconut Girl says;

47
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:13,536
Won't you agree to one thing I said?

48
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,930
Dad's crying...

49
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,677
He loves you so much.

50
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,627
I love him so much too!

51
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:43,239
I, too, will tear up when I'll remember him.

52
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,370
C'mon!

53
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,060
Return my ring.

54
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,299
Mam was saying to me on that day itself, 'What kind of engagement is this'?

55
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:06,380
'Which the boy's parents didn't attend'?

56
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:18,406
I said, 'Thank God he's come'.

57
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,140
'I would've agreed to the blighter's proposal had he asked to get engaged over the phone'.

58
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,979
<i>Every compeer</i>

59
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:55,821
<i>Every compeer</i>

60
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,130
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

61
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,631
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

62
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,289
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

63
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:18,620
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm not returning your ring.

65
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,650
I'm keeping it to show it off before Mam!

66
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,380
I'll tell her it's a long term engagement,

67
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,940
That I'm waiting a lifetime for the marriage...

68
00:07:51,877 --> 00:07:53,316
C'mon now.

69
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:55,876
Drop me at my place.

70
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,080
I'd written all those letters, Lubna...

71
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,810
Which letters?

72
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,561
The same

73
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:46,502
That Afzal has.

74
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:49,384
A lie.

75
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,970
You're lying.

76
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:56,191
Don't say 'You're lying' now that I've accepted it.

77
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:01,040
I've been caught because of Miss Mary D'Souza.

78
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,550
I wouldn't have admitted it otherwise.

79
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,160
And when you'd gone to Afzal's place after ritual purification,

80
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,800
And said to his mother that you can swear on the Qur'an,

81
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,370
Why did you say that?

82
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:22,379
You were ready to commit such a grave sin?

83
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,297
I knew she wouldn't let me.

84
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,920
Oh God!

85
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,733
I'm so ashamed already...

86
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,154
Forgive me... Please...

87
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,400
Try to make a list

88
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,219
Check out how many people you'll need to apologise to, and how many will forgive you.

89
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:46,909
Dad will punch you right in the jaw!

90
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:49,519
I'm determined now, Lubna...

91
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,299
I'll take it.

92
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:53,499
And when God asks you,

93
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:55,659
What will you do about that?

94
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,331
Yasmin's taken care of it,

95
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,892
She said, 'Confess the sins of lying and breaking him'.

96
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:06,660
'I'll weep for you and ask forgiveness for you'.

97
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,443
She was weeping?

98
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,191
A lot.

99
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:13,127
She loves Afzal so much...

100
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,331
One-sided.

101
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,922
And that blighter loves me.

102
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,942
So she sacrificed herself to you.

103
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,802
I'd tried to dissuade her,

104
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,276
I said,

105
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:26,125
'Marry him'.

106
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,273
You're so simple...

107
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:31,636
But she said, 'Be uncharitable in love'.

108
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,670
'Had I been in your place',

109
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,789
'I'd have trampled everyone underfoot'!

110
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:39,200
And that's something you must've learnt instantly.

111
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,695
For you trampled Yasmin underfoot momentarily!

112
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,560
I love Afzal, Lubna...

113
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,840
Tell me, then,

114
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,490
What do I do?

115
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:13,570
Call Sibtain,

116
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,201
Say to him, 'I'm not marrying you'.

117
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,720
Why don't you --?

118
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,820
Poor chap's a good man.

119
00:11:36,507 --> 00:11:38,166
I guess I'll have to now...

120
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,478
Else, everyone's going to say,

121
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,386
'These girls just like to get things started',

122
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,636
'They never get things moving forward'.

123
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,090
It's my sacrifice for you!

124
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,446
Call her here.

125
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,036
Tell her her dresses are ready.

126
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:23,036
Tell her to have a look, get ready; we're leaving.

127
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:24,306
Where's Mum?

128
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:26,986
At the jeweller's; she told me to come with her.

129
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,291
She's selecting the jewellery?

130
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,896
Of course!

131
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,892
Come with me.

132
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,931
Get these upstairs.

133
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,867
D -- Dad...

134
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:48,856
Please endure this final bulletin --

135
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,566
Final bulletin?

136
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,566
Slap me if you get angry.

137
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,905
But tell Mum that it's my decision.

138
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,576
I mean -- yours.

139
00:12:57,628 --> 00:12:59,816
Don't say a word about Farah.

140
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,115
I don't want to hear any news about her.

141
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,419
I promise, Dad.

142
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,409
I won't say anything from Farah.

143
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,308
Have no fear, then.

144
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,329
Tell me - what is it?

145
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:13,468
Uh --

146
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:14,565
Dad -- It's --

147
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,409
You know -- Sibtain?

148
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:18,526
What happened to Sibtain?

149
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,605
Nothing's happened to him.

150
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,885
Please listen patiently.

151
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:25,136
Alright, go on...

152
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,243
It's --

153
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:30,347
Sibtain actually --

154
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,610
Was for me.

155
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,081
I mean -- he --

156
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,810
The proposal --

157
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,061
Was intended for me.

158
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,390
What?

159
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:41,910
I swear, Dad.

160
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:45,212
But I said, 'There's one condition'.

161
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,262
What condition?

162
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,941
You're getting angry, aren't you?

163
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,741
I'm not getting angry!

164
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,582
Get over with it.

165
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,171
The condition was that

166
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,442
He'd cure Farah completely.

167
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,841
Cure her?

168
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:59,142
What do you mean?

169
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,731
Dad, she's cured!

170
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:03,424
She's admitted that she used to write those letters to Afzal!

171
00:14:03,424 --> 00:14:06,532
Nobody will mention Afzal in this house now!

172
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,030
Let me finish, Dad!

173
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,356
Isra will die if she heard anything like this!

174
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,851
She's in on it, Dad!

175
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
I've french fried your brain, haven't I, Dad?

176
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,510
But this time, the mistake wasn't Farah's.

177
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,460
I've fried it this time.

178
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,070
For God's sake, what will Sibtain's parents think?

179
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:30,371
Nothing at all!

180
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,211
They're in on it too!

181
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,441
Why did you have to conceal it from me, then?

182
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,143
You can't act, Dad!

183
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,633
We thought it'd be better if you performed naturally!

184
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,031
So she's 'cured'!

185
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:47,591
Completely, Dad!

186
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:51,204
Don't you all think it's a bit too late now?

187
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,661
Be honest with me -

188
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:57,611
Have I been more of a father to you or a friend?

189
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,641
A friend, of course.

190
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,162
Tell Farah, then, that no friend would ever give this advice

191
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:06,062
To even think about Afzal.

192
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,759
You're saying this because of Yasmin, right?

193
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,119
She's no more --

194
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,101
I mean, she's breaking the engagement.

195
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:18,881
She's the one who explained everything to Farah.

196
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,169
She said that the engagement was just like Sibtain and Farah's 'marriage'.

197
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,709
Only that she'd been a tad bit serious.

198
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:27,019
But Afzal was just exacting his vengeance from Farah.

199
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,229
Vengeance -- as in, Farah got engaged the other day,

200
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,589
So he got envious and got engaged on the same day.

201
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,169
He's come after committing 12 murders in Karachi, Lubna.

202
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,149
He'll have to pay for them all.

203
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,889
She'll have him pay for it.

204
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,180
She'll ask him why he did it.

205
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,379
He must be having an answer too.

206
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,610
Otherwise, he'll just say sorry --

207
00:15:46,874 --> 00:15:48,534
Come on, Lubna...

208
00:15:48,534 --> 00:15:50,874
Let me think like this, Dad...

209
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,517
He's come now.

210
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,754
He's playing cricket here in Hyderabad.

211
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,174
Let him play.

212
00:15:57,574 --> 00:16:00,095
Don't talk about murder.

213
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,313
How far is Karachi?

214
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:56,630
Here you go and there you arrive!

215
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,236
Don't cry, Aunt.

216
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:03,056
We'll talk over the phone.

217
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,476
I'd never talk to you.

218
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,556
Tell me,

219
00:17:08,697 --> 00:17:10,876
Who am I to talk to you?

220
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:14,164
You're family.

221
00:17:15,874 --> 00:17:19,094
The one-sided engagement's still there.

222
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:22,516
Given that, you're my mother-in-law.

223
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,969
50-50.

224
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,872
Where's Uncle?

225
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:45,060
He'd be in his room, crying...

226
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,180
I thought I'd meet him.

227
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,399
It's me, Uncle... Yasmin.

228
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,461
May I come in?

229
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,319
Don't you dare set foot in the room!

230
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,960
I don't want to meet you!

231
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,850
Not at all!

232
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,520
Please allow me...

233
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,428
I'll be there in your heart even after I'm gone...

234
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:47,130
Every time you'd look at the Coconut Girl, you'd bless me.

235
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,236
Scold me if it's a lie.

236
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,535
Otherwise, let me go.

237
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,480
I have to go.

238
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,360
Whether you grant me leave,

239
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:09,226
Or not.

240
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,060
God be with you...

241
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,180
You're leaving because Farah used to write letters to me, right?

242
00:20:44,807 --> 00:20:46,297
To be honest,

243
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:50,697
She did not write those letters to me.

244
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,658
I used to write those letters myself under her name.

245
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:58,056
No.

246
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:00,636
That's not why I'm going.

247
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:03,495
I'm going because

248
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,313
That blighter loves you.

249
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,180
So much that she cannot bring herself to say it.

250
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,150
She started crying buckets and buckets when she was about to say it.

251
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,448
Who is it?

252
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,538
Sibtain and his father.

253
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,796
Why are they here?

254
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,338
And why are they laughing?

255
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,425
They're happy

256
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:22,795
That Sibtain's not getting married to you.

257
00:22:22,795 --> 00:22:24,035
Oh seriously!

258
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,825
As if I'd marry that ignoble psychiatrist!

259
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,829
What were you looking at over there?

260
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:38,477
Afzal was going somewhere with Yasmin.

261
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,747
Look at how she turned away!

262
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:42,987
She didn't even meet me as she left!

263
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:45,287
Don't be so happy about it.

264
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:47,450
She's left this place with tears in her eyes.

265
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:53,908
Bless her in your prayers now that you're getting married to Afzal.

266
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,139
Did you talk to Afzal?

267
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,936
Not even now?

268
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:07,826
Tell him to talk to me.

269
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,167
You're both trapped in these issues.

270
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:13,377
He couldn't say it, and nor could you.

271
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,617
I'm never saying it.

272
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:16,987
Alright.

273
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:18,978
Wait until the marriage.

274
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:21,868
You'll start saying it all then.

275
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,757
Where are you going?

276
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:25,568
Downstairs.

277
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,602
The date of your marriage is being decided.

278
00:23:27,602 --> 00:23:31,067
Dad's saying you'll get married this Sunday and the next Sunday will mark the celebrations.

279
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:34,231
But -- Molvi Uncle didn't even talk about it...

280
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:37,481
The two of them don't have such issues as you two!

281
00:24:02,154 --> 00:24:04,094
There was one Yasmin,

282
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,974
Who loved my brother,

283
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,894
But my brother

284
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,334
Loved Farah.

285
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:16,585
Seeing it, one would believe that if love is one sided, it is often more than mere love,

286
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,954
But one never knows

287
00:24:18,954 --> 00:24:21,584
That if love becomes something more than mere love,

288
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,644
What does it turn into?

289
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:48,670
It's midnight, isn't it?

290
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:50,939
Yes.

291
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,159
Why did you set an alarm for midnight?

292
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:00,206
I figured

293
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,439
He'd have arrived by midnight.

294
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,452
He must've arrived there.

295
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:16,229
We're going to Monseigneur Ibrahim's tomorrow.

296
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,937
Are we invited?

297
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:27,096
What are you asking, Ruqaiyya Begum?

298
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:30,035
It's the girl's family.

299
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,066
Why should they invite us?

300
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:35,555
We'd go to them!

301
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:38,656
We'd beseech them humbly,

302
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:39,675
'Please'

303
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:42,303
'Be so generous'

304
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:46,365
'As enrapture us by giving us Farah'.

305
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,910
Yasmin?

306
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:26,639
Yasmin, wake up. We're at your place.

307
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,490
Thank you.

308
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,861
Listen.

309
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,776
Won't you ask me to come in?

310
00:26:45,116 --> 00:26:46,346
No.

311
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,976
I'll start to grow on you if you come inside.

312
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,450
Will you forgive me?

313
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,937
Did you call Farah?

314
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,906
Call her.

315
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:07,996
Tell her how much you love her.

316
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:10,512
I'll forgive you that instant.

317
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:20,459
Take care.

318
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:38,615
Listen.

319
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,100
If you ever visit Karachi...

320
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,150
Do not pay me a visit.

321
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:36,603
Did you call Farah?

322
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,006
Call her.

323
00:28:39,244 --> 00:28:42,354
Tell her how much you love her.

324
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
I'll forgive you that instant.

325
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,481
Dear Afzal,

326
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:13,957
Do you know the most undeniable truth in the world?

327
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:15,857
Don't guess.

328
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,514
Hear it from me:

329
00:29:18,244 --> 00:29:21,634
The most undeniable truth in the world is that

330
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:26,634
Farah Ibrahim

331
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,884
Loves you.

332
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,860
Hello?

333
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,321
Afzal --

334
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,569
Yes, Afzal?

335
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:12,159
Go on; why are did you stop?

336
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,170
Afzal?

337
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,626
Do you have the slightest shame?

338
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:23,546
Farah, let's go --

339
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:25,243
Hey! Get off!

340
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:27,303
Let me see who's the boss!

341
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,043
Now that your engagement plan failed,

342
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,653
You stand in my way to get even?

343
00:31:33,653 --> 00:31:35,904
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

344
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:38,863
Want to besmirch my reputation?

345
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:42,876
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son,

346
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:48,275
So I thought you'd not step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

347
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,625
You'd drown in shame,

348
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:55,096
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

349
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:31,940
Hello?

350
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:37,080
Farah here.

351
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,614
I know --

352
00:33:43,614 --> 00:33:45,790
The call got disconnected?

353
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:47,684
Yes --

354
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:49,384
Disconnected.

355
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:52,274
So what was it you were saying?

356
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:55,525
I was saying --

357
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,962
That's what you always do.

358
00:34:00,962 --> 00:34:02,460
It's either that you can't say,

359
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,033
Or can't say the whole thing.

360
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,390
Go on.

361
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:11,329
I'm listening.

362
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:17,596
Farah,

363
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,367
Yes...

364
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,156
Once you say something after 'Farah', you'll see

365
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:30,506
How you start speaking everything!

366
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,550
Speak up...

367
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,900
Tell me...

368
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:51,019
Why did you call me?

369
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:58,286
I wanted to talk to you about the letters.

370
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,546
Yes, go on?

371
00:35:00,546 --> 00:35:03,026
Go ahead from the letters.

372
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,256
But, I --

373
00:35:08,344 --> 00:35:09,634
Alright.

374
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:11,657
I'll start.

375
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:14,014
But -- You finish it.

376
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,186
I wrote all those letters.

377
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,846
For you.

378
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,077
To you.

379
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:31,270
A fib...

380
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:37,067
All the letters, I --

381
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,100
I wrote them myself.

382
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:43,191
To you...

383
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,652
Sorry --

384
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,292
Why are you saying sorry?

385
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:53,858
You were right.

386
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:56,022
It's alright if you'd written them.

387
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,383
Go on.

388
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:06,510
These long pauses of yours, Afzal,

389
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,840
Something's not right.

390
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:15,559
It's cost a lot before.

391
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,059
C'mon, be a man!

392
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:18,930
Tell me clearly that --

393
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,490
You love me.

394
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,640
That's it --

395
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,494
What's it?

396
00:36:28,494 --> 00:36:30,629
I love you...

397
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,660
So much...

398
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,570
But Farah,

399
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,490
Don't say 'Farah' like that...

400
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,560
I might die when I hear it.

401
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,890
There you go silent again!

402
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,451
Listen,

403
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,729
I've written a letter to you.

404
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,692
For real this time,

405
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:07,820
I'll post it tomorrow, and you'll receive it the day after.

406
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,459
'Don't ask me what I've written,

407
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,849
Just...

408
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:20,759
It opens with 'Dear Afzal'.

409
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:33,356
You're so shameless.

410
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:36,727
Said it to my face that you love me so much!

411
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,820
Now, I'm a girl;

412
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,539
I have to think.

413
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:02,880
I've written this after a lot of thinking.

414
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,415
I'm not telling you anything else.

415
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,579
You're on the way, aren't you?

416
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,979
When will you be back here?

417
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,930
Tell me...?

418
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,260
Please tell me...

419
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:29,190
Speak up

420
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,749
Please?

421
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,900
How many times to I have to tell you, Afzal,

422
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,610
Your silence costs all of us so much.

423
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:53,750
<i>Who were those people</i>

424
00:38:54,374 --> 00:39:00,834
<i>Who won their love?</i>

425
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:06,694
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

426
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:14,064
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

427
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:19,984
<i>Who were</i>

428
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:25,873
<i>Those people</i>

429
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:32,706
<i>Who won their love?</i>

430
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,400
<i>When looking for the garth of happiness</i>

431
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,019
<i>The sands of sorrow engulfed me</i>

432
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:55,541
<i>When looking for the garth of happiness</i>

433
00:39:55,541 --> 00:40:01,130
<i>The sands of sorrow engulfed me</i>

434
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:06,719
<i>When desired an ode to love</i>

435
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:12,309
<i>Cold sobs rewarded me</i>

436
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:17,559
<i>Every compeer I found doubled my heart's grief</i>

437
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,260
