1
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:13,701
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:18,926
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:23,994
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:30,420
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,028
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:40,660
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,260
Sit down.

8
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,840
Tell me, now,

9
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,280
Whom are you obdurate against?

10
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,863
Won't you share what lies in your heart with the one you'd get engaged to?

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,640
She's getting engaged tomorrow.

12
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:56,604
You're exacting your revenge?

13
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,809
She doesn't love you, does she?

14
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:07,002
You don't love me, either.

15
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,251
How would I get even with you?

16
00:02:12,822 --> 00:02:15,851
By getting engaged to you?

17
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:21,376
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

18
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:24,762
And please Yasmin, too!

19
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:29,966
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Yasmin'.

20
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:34,300
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

21
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,939
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

22
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,676
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

23
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:45,464
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

24
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,381
I'm serious, Yasmin.

25
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:49,172
I've come here with a proposal.

26
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:51,354
I'm serious, too, Afzal.

27
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:55,015
I reject your proposal.

28
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,305
Come.

29
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:13,781
Mam would've dreamt about a lot, seeing this meeting...

30
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,832
Let's shatter everything in a moment.

31
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,750
Wait, Yasmin.

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,507
I give you my word,

33
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:34,716
I'll marry you and only you if I get engaged to you.

34
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,441
You could --

35
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:42,246
You could think I've fallen in love with you.

36
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:48,310
You lie so artfully, boyo!

37
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,044
It almost sounds like you're honest.

38
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,922
Alright, if you're honest,

39
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,804
Prove it to me.

40
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,221
Change the date of the engagement.

41
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:04,864
I won't change it to any day after tomorrow.

42
00:04:04,864 --> 00:04:07,229
Then, how about a day earlier?

43
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,837
If you've bought the ring,

44
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,864
Put it on me today.

45
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,844
But you can have one thing in writing -

46
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:21,349
If she's getting engaged tomorrow,

47
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,585
I'm not getting engaged to you tomorrow.

48
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,634
Come downstairs if you're in the mood to get engaged.

49
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:35,312
Or I'll look down from the window and see that you're leaving.

50
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,647
Why are you panting?

51
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:58,575
Just a minute.

52
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,063
Where's Afzal?

53
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:03,687
We'll know in a moment.

54
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,720
Yasmin!

55
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,260
He's left, Mam.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,642
He'd come over with a plan to come,

57
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:49,652
And he took the option to leave.

58
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:51,957
You refused?

59
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,868
You know

60
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:57,033
That I couldn't have refused!

61
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,674
Why did he leave, then?

62
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,958
We had a row over the date of the engagement.

63
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,261
I wanted the date of the new moon,

64
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:07,535
And he wanted the date of the lunar eclipse.

65
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,374
I said it too,

66
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,673
Whether or not we get engaged,

67
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:14,271
I'm not agreeing to the date of the eclipse.

68
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,620
He won't come again.

69
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,388
I, too, pray that he never come now.

70
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:24,136
Promise me, then,

71
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:27,339
That you will never weep for him again.

72
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,579
You're not intelligent at all, Mam!

73
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:33,807
I don't weep for him.

74
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:39,119
I weep at the love that I have for that eejit.

75
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:50,423
If I've shed a few tears to get over this sorrow, don't think that I'm weeping.

76
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,637
What is this?

77
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,292
Shoes...

78
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,985
I've brought --

79
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:07,685
Shoes for you.

80
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,386
What for?

81
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,304
Know what,

82
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,618
I've got five pairs here,

83
00:07:11,618 --> 00:07:13,595
And two lying in the car.

84
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:16,228
I've settled for this after a lot of searching...

85
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,202
All of these are of different types...

86
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:18,932
Each one better then the other!

87
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:20,552
Take whichever ones you like. Hi, Lubna!

88
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:21,727
Hi!

89
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:22,794
Why have you brought these?

90
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,091
Silly question!

91
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:27,741
Does anyone ever ask one's fiancé why he's brought gifts?

92
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,966
Who's bought them?

93
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,432
I have, of course! It took me two hours to get them!

94
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:35,472
So I'd wear shoes of your choice?

95
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:37,234
No, you'd wear shoes of your choice.

96
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,191
There are many in these.

97
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,772
Keep the ones you like, and return the others.

98
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:43,307
How do you know my shoe size?

99
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:45,069
C'mon, Farah,

100
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,739
You'd said 'My foot' the other day.

101
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,870
My eyes darted to your feet at that moment.

102
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,467
Your size is 7, innit?

103
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,013
7 is Lubna's size.

104
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:54,962
My shoe size is 6.

105
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,569
Oh...

106
00:07:58,234 --> 00:07:59,100
What's going on?

107
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,241
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

108
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,976
And upon you, peace.

109
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:04,601
Sibtain's brought shoes for Farah.

110
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,520
How cute!

111
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,675
It's not cute, Mum.

112
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,766
Why'd the boy buy shoes for the girl?

113
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,315
The things men do in love...

114
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:17,567
Don't look at the shoes;

115
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:19,547
Look at his love.

116
00:08:19,547 --> 00:08:21,602
You can look at size 7 shoes

117
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,560
If not wear them.

118
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,188
I can wear them.

119
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:32,259
What else worn by me are you going to wear?

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,382
Anyway,

121
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,193
Take these shoes away,

122
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:38,833
And get me size 6 ones.

123
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,300
How big a difference is one number, really?

124
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,909
And, frankly speaking,

125
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,135
Everyone's looking at the girl's face.

126
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:47,635
Only the husband looks at her feet.

127
00:08:58,154 --> 00:08:59,298
I should go after her, shouldn't I?

128
00:08:59,298 --> 00:09:00,785
Double time!

129
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,490
May I come in?

130
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,606
What is it now?

131
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,437
Nothing, really.

132
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:32,546
I'd just come to say

133
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:35,747
That you should've taken a look at the shoes...

134
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:37,751
I will.

135
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:41,707
It'd delight my heart if you'd only tried them on for once...

136
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,270
Just decide in one shot

137
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,108
What I have to do to delight you.

138
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,577
Nothing much.

139
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:49,058
I'd even be delighted to see you happy.

140
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:53,013
And the truth is I'd come to make you happy, and not to be delighted myself.

141
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:56,936
And I'm chuffed to see 7 pairs of size 7 shoes.

142
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:57,588
Look,

143
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,608
We're getting engaged tomorrow.

144
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:00,395
I mean,

145
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:02,838
Our sorrows and happiness will be united.

146
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:05,791
Likewise, if our love is united,

147
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,166
Our feelings, and our thoughts are united,

148
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,129
People would hail us as the ideal couple.

149
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,912
Get to the point.

150
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,388
What could be a more important point than love?

151
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:19,021
If only you paid attention to the 'points'...

152
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,750
If you don't let your heart connect with your mind, how will a link form,

153
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,755
And, in the absence of such a link, you are always unsettled, restless, and troubled.

154
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:29,599
Is this you telling me about my illness?

155
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:31,890
Don't you dare, you bloody psychiatrist!

156
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,495
I'm not trying to prove myself to be a bloody psychiatrist at all.

157
00:10:36,495 --> 00:10:37,732
I was actually

158
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:39,928
Telling you a lover's point of view.

159
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,057
Lover?

160
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,872
M --
-Please don't say anything like 'My foot'!

161
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:45,960
A psychiatrist can take his insult,

162
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,526
But love never takes any insult.

163
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:52,914
The thing is, you need someone who loves you intensely for such turbulence,

164
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:56,193
Provided, of course, that you love him intensely, too.

165
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:57,817
Fortunately,

166
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,538
Such a lover is available to you,

167
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:02,143
But unfortunately,

168
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,355
You aren't available to him.

169
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,750
Did you get the ring?

170
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,218
Which ring?

171
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:09,874
The engagement ring.

172
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,959
I'd returned it to you, hadn't I?

173
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,832
I'm not asking about that ring.

174
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,622
Tell me about the one you'd returned

175
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:18,762
With the fiancé.

176
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,171
I've decided

177
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:29,252
That I can't turn down such a trifling wish of my fiancée's.

178
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:33,814
You'd wear the same engagement ring tomorrow.

179
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:37,604
What's his Paw's name?

180
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,322
Whose Dad?

181
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:41,575
The one whom you folks call 'Afzal'.

182
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,353
Afzal's his name.

183
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,252
Not him; what's his Paw's name?

184
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,719
Subhanallah [Praise the Lord].

185
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,592
Say 'Subhanallah' [Praise the Lord] later; first, tell me his Dad's name.

186
00:11:50,592 --> 00:11:53,295
Subhanallah is his name.

187
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,350
Subhanallah [Praise the Lord]!

188
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,186
Then, Mr Subhanallah will put the ring on you tomorrow.

189
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:03,269
Paw's said this will heal his heart's wound.

190
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,923
There's nothing like a wound on a heart, really, though.

191
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:09,228
But Paw said it so convincingly that I thought

192
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,639
That it's something beyond science.

193
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,832
Well,

194
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,073
I'd only come to say that.

195
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,202
Listen!

196
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:22,175
I'll wear those size 7 shoes.

197
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:48,825
Arifa!

198
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,393
Coming, Dad.

199
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:58,306
Yes, Dad?

200
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:00,735
Let me come in first.

201
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:01,848
Sure,

202
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,594
Come.

203
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,930
Do you remember the last time you'd come inside my room?

204
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,539
I don't, either!

205
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:19,672
I just remember

206
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:22,115
That I'd fallen down while playing on the stairs.

207
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,743
My nose got hurt, I fell unconscious.

208
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:28,322
That's when you'd come running from the Mosque.

209
00:13:28,322 --> 00:13:30,884
I've heard you'd spent the entire night sitting by me?

210
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:33,195
Chanting prayers,

211
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:34,724
Saying to God,

212
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,733
'Make her come to, O Lord',

213
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,983
'Or I may miss the morning prayers'!

214
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,707
Please, sit.

215
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,271
The thing is,

216
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,816
The rooms

217
00:13:45,816 --> 00:13:50,730
Of the mother and the daughter are places where one should show the utmost respect.

218
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,948
One doesn't just go there the way

219
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:59,614
I'd barge into Afzal's room.

220
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,988
Why don't you sit, too?

221
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:10,306
You've come inside my room after so many years,

222
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:11,064
So, tell me,

223
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,440
What'd you like to have?

224
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,001
You've half taken after your mother.

225
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:19,280
You keep your heart's secrets locked deep inside.

226
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,872
Alright,

227
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:23,018
I'd come inside your room

228
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:26,902
Every once in a while.

229
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:29,802
In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

230
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,778
Alright,

231
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:34,840
Tell me,

232
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,189
Where's the ring?

233
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,321
Ring?

234
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:42,485
Now, don't say 'Which ring'?

235
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:45,388
You know it very well.

236
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:48,143
I'd thrown it away because

237
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:52,414
Ruqaiyya had thought of getting something else made from it,

238
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,157
Or selling it

239
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,720
To get some money.

240
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,901
Why had you kept it with you?

241
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,125
Just kept it...

242
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,097
As a reminder.

243
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:07,297
A reminder of what?

244
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,605
What good is it to us?

245
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:14,142
I didn't think of what good it is.

246
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:17,668
I just thought that we'd had it made for my brother's fiancée,

247
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,074
So, it's for the memory.

248
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:22,441
A memory of what, my dear?

249
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:24,479
Would you show us such things

250
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:27,016
To torment us further?

251
00:15:27,016 --> 00:15:29,261
Go and see.

252
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,469
We've even taken his picture off from the room.

253
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,956
No, Dad...

254
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:37,654
You haven't taken it off from the room.

255
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,819
Mum's just changed where it's kept.

256
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:43,147
It's underneath her pillow now.

257
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:44,766
There...

258
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,672
Whoever would tell her

259
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:50,759
That one's only got a confrontation destined with sin;

260
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,615
One doesn't have any ties.

261
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:57,063
So, do you have no ties with him, now?

262
00:15:57,063 --> 00:16:00,167
Have you forgotten that he's your son?

263
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:05,944
I've heard that you'd sat next to Farah to glimpse Afzal?

264
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:09,333
That was just -- that day...

265
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,411
I'd just mentioned his name for your mother's happiness...

266
00:16:13,411 --> 00:16:15,481
She's

267
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,848
Got a frail heart, right?

268
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:21,423
So have I got a very strong heart, Dad?

269
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,974
I'm his sister.

270
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:28,776
If I'm tormented for him, I'm tormented again to see Mum.

271
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,352
I mean,

272
00:16:30,352 --> 00:16:33,117
I'm tormented more than Mum.

273
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:37,131
The two of you will bring me to tears one day!

274
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,323
And remember,

275
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,265
A judgement will be pronounced against me

276
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,364
The day I wept!

277
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:46,225
No judgement will be pronounced, Dad.

278
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:50,329
Who says that if He can understand a mother's heart, He cannot understand a father's heart?

279
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:56,403
Perhaps a judgement may be pronounced over a father who did not weep even after his son left?

280
00:16:56,403 --> 00:17:00,572
Just try to weep on this pretext for once, Dad.

281
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:05,227
Who knows, He may just be waiting for you to weep?

282
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:13,549
By the Lord, Dad,

283
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:15,402
Don't cry.

284
00:17:15,402 --> 00:17:19,390
You just asked me to weep...

285
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,473
I'd asked you to weep, Dad.

286
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,904
I didn't ask you to show me that you're weeping.

287
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:36,142
Alright,

288
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,616
Give me the ring.

289
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:42,124
What'd you do with it?

290
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:48,700
She'd come utterly dispirited and penitent;

291
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,714
Witnessing her, it occurred to me

292
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:55,974
That sometimes, the most brutal punishment you can mete out

293
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,123
To someone who had no mercy on you

294
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:02,582
Is to be merciful.

295
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,931
So, give it, my dear.

296
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:07,264
It'll be our tribute of

297
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:12,008
19,700 from us to her.

298
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:16,817
One gives something on the occasion of an engagement, right?

299
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,864
One doesn't give with a generous heart to one who's broken one's heart, Dad,

300
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:22,291
Which is why I won't give her the ring.

301
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,273
I'd have earrings made from it,

302
00:18:24,273 --> 00:18:27,083
Or sell it to get some money.

303
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,921
She'd have only blessings for us

304
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,351
If it satisfies her.

305
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:34,974
Take the blessings, my dear.

306
00:18:34,974 --> 00:18:38,339
The ring won't be of any use.

307
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:41,089
The blessings would be of great use.

308
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:44,516
If someone else put my brother's ring on her,

309
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,204
I may utter a curse!

310
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:50,371
Just pray that she be saved from my curse.

311
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,089
Leave it be, Molvi Sahab.

312
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:58,021
Don't attack frail hearts, emboldened by your own strong heart.

313
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,118
If she were so penitent,

314
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:03,082
She could've asked for the one the ring was from instead of the ring itself.

315
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:07,746
By the Lord, I'd have gotten her what she wanted then.

316
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,343
Did you see that?

317
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:20,807
She's thrown a jibe of 'strong-hearted' too!

318
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:25,085
Tell her, sometime,

319
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,972
That this strong-hearted man

320
00:19:27,972 --> 00:19:32,602
Had wept at one command of yours.

321
00:19:32,602 --> 00:19:34,905
Good night.

322
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,013
She won't give me the ring.

323
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:27,749
She gets an itch to exact her revenge every so often.

324
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:29,496
Although her Mum and Dad

325
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:32,170
Have forgotten the incident at the engagement,

326
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,857
She doesn't seem to forget.

327
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:37,847
I can even read her expressions.

328
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,821
If she smiles while looking at me, it feels

329
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,754
As if she's cursing me.

330
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,208
And when her Mum smiles?

331
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,754
How do you feel then?

332
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:46,896
Normal.

333
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,229
Completely normal.

334
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:50,966
Then, you just note Arifa's expressions.

335
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:54,395
You haven't the foggiest about her.

336
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:57,347
Not at all.

337
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,567
She says

338
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,934
That she sees Afzal in me.

339
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,864
They're God's dearest, Mademoiselle.

340
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:06,553
They are courteous to guests.

341
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:07,472
What do you mean?

342
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:09,316
I've seen their smile.

343
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:10,875
You'll see,

344
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:15,494
She'd kill you with the same smile one day.

345
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,741
It isn't really a smile...

346
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,624
It's perplexity

347
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:24,482
That's set in on her lips.

348
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,336
What's the perplexity about?

349
00:21:26,336 --> 00:21:29,731
How you're still able to get up and walk!

350
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:31,492
First, she'd have thought

351
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:33,761
That one smile would kill you,

352
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:38,982
Or that her second will cause the ground to be cleft asunder, and you, with all your cardinal sins, shall be plunged into the abyss.

353
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,957
But that didn't happen.

354
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:45,727
So, pray that she doesn't attend your engagement tomorrow.

355
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:48,079
What'd happen if she attended my engagement?

356
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,477
Seeing you as a bride would torment her.

357
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:55,139
An ember would emanate from her eye, which would turn you to ash.

358
00:21:56,468 --> 00:21:57,831
Then, she'd better come.

359
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,038
Let me see, too, how the ember emanates from her eye,

360
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,275
And how it turns me to ash.

361
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:07,836
Your face looks very spooky.

362
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,538
Leave my face be;

363
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,442
Think of how you'd look when you'd have turned to ash.

364
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,867
Put a sock in it.

365
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,326
I chant my own funeral prayers thrice every day.

366
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:19,577
It's for the better.

367
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,298
One should keep on doing that.

368
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,834
Someone else may be chanting it in your place tomorrow.

369
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,486
So, all those conversations,

370
00:22:26,486 --> 00:22:28,400
All that affection, all those blandishments -

371
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,834
Is all of it a lie?

372
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,357
She'd call me up to her

373
00:22:32,357 --> 00:22:33,950
And ward troubles off me.

374
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,111
She keeps her enemy alive.

375
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:40,358
She's decided to kill you with her own two hands.

376
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,994
And Molvi Uncle?

377
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,452
He'd brought coconut biscuits for me.

378
00:22:44,452 --> 00:22:45,647
He always says,

379
00:22:45,647 --> 00:22:48,968
'Let Farah not leave empty-handed'.

380
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,839
That's just a matter of getting even.

381
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,982
Remember

382
00:22:51,982 --> 00:22:53,927
How you'd not let him leave empty-handed either?

383
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:56,629
You'd packed for him a lifetime's worth of sorrow, saying,

384
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:57,901
'Go'.

385
00:22:57,901 --> 00:23:01,778
'Forget your son; live with this sorrow'.

386
00:23:02,404 --> 00:23:04,876
Now, he lives with the sorrow you've given them,

387
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:10,517
And gives you coconut biscuits in thanksgiving.

388
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,164
You're envious, aren't you?

389
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,578
Envious?

390
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,900
Afzal's family loves me so much.

391
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,400
It pains you to see it, doesn't it?

392
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:36,236
What does this chuckle mean?

393
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,454
Nothing, really.

394
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:49,387
I chuckle when I hear you say 'Afzal' and 'love' in the same line.

395
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,827
Forget about everything.

396
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:54,965
Just concentrate on your engagement.

397
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:58,123
Tell Sibtain that I can't get that ring.

398
00:23:58,123 --> 00:24:00,744
I don't want to pick a fight with Arifa.

399
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:02,432
You've already picked a fight with her.

400
00:24:02,432 --> 00:24:04,487
Did you have to ask for the ring?

401
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:06,047
Here, their wounds start healing,

402
00:24:06,047 --> 00:24:08,304
And there you are to rub salt in them.

403
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:11,034
Granted that you regret what you've done,

404
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:16,068
But who'd like the idea of wearing an old ring at a new engagement?

405
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,834
Sibtain could even die for you,

406
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,904
Which is why he's at your service with the shoes and his head.

407
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,146
Otherwise, if you'd wear a ring sent by his corrival,

408
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:26,619
It'll be the last nail in the coffin of the lover's honour.

409
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,672
Who's this corrival?

410
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,869
I'm talking about poor old Afzal.

411
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:33,738
He'd have gotten the news.

412
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:34,759
Ah, yes.

413
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,706
Alladio's come over from there.

414
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:39,168
He's told him about your engagement.

415
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,089
He'd have gotten the news.

416
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:43,712
Just watch what happens next...

417
00:24:43,712 --> 00:24:45,570
What'll happen?

418
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,532
He won't remain at peace.

419
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:49,971
Would he come?

420
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:52,396
So, do you mean

421
00:24:52,396 --> 00:24:55,129
That he'd try to stop the engagement?

422
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:57,320
He isn't the type.

423
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,750
What'd he do, then?

424
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,251
He'd give a befitting reply.

425
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,550
Well,

426
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,267
Whatever can he do now?

427
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:09,445
Get engaged.

428
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:11,856
Get engaged, as in?

429
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,715
You're getting engaged tomorrow,

430
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:17,360
And you'll see, he'd get engaged tomorrow, too.

431
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,372
To whom?

432
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:21,268
He's got an affair going on with you,

433
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:23,343
Whom would he get engaged to?

434
00:25:23,343 --> 00:25:25,809
Yasmin.

435
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:29,952
So wasn't he serious with you?

436
00:25:29,952 --> 00:25:31,641
He was very serious,

437
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,608
But she'll be the only one available to him at a moment's notice.

438
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:37,737
Plus, she'd agree, too.

439
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,070
The blighter...

440
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:07,301
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

441
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,889
And please Yasmin, too!

442
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:15,892
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Yasmin'.

443
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:18,369
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

444
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:21,515
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

445
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:24,249
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

446
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:29,454
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

447
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:58,663
This number is on another call. Please wait.

448
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:10,141
Who is it?

449
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,150
It's Farah.

450
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,323
Farah who?

451
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,364
Don't you recognise me?

452
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:17,123
It's Farah...

453
00:27:17,123 --> 00:27:18,621
I'd come from Hyderabad

454
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:19,888
With my Dad

455
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,817
Looking for Afzal?

456
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,160
Oh, yes...

457
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,537
I remember you well.

458
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:27,700
Haven't you saved my number?

459
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,390
I'd deliberately not saved it.

460
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,348
Why?

461
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,604
I'd fear that you might call.

462
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,150
How are you?

463
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,410
You're calling at 1 a.m.; haven't you found him yet?

464
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,450
Who's talking about him?

465
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,808
It was just

466
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,511
That I remembered you,

467
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:46,911
And thought I'd talk to you.

468
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:49,106
I'm sorry

469
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:51,049
But I think you were sleeping...

470
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,027
No, not at all.

471
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:54,338
I was awake.

472
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:56,936
In fact, I stay awake.

473
00:27:57,303 --> 00:27:58,370
So,

474
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,883
What's up these days?

475
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:01,862
I've started teaching the kids.

476
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:03,067
Splendid.

477
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:04,894
That's very good.

478
00:28:04,894 --> 00:28:07,644
That's just what's good now.

479
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,184
Has he left?

480
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:12,130
Are you talking about Afzal?

481
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,305
Yes.

482
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,850
He left a long while ago,

483
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,976
But he does come over sometimes.

484
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:20,681
He's become a don now, hasn't he?

485
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:22,010
He'd said as he left,

486
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,453
'I'd come back a great man'.

487
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,636
I've heard he's earned a lot, too.

488
00:28:27,636 --> 00:28:29,832
Don't you have his number?

489
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,471
What'd I do with his number?

490
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:34,972
Then, what'd you do to know about him?

491
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,641
That was just

492
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,622
That his mention came up,

493
00:28:38,622 --> 00:28:41,936
And I thought I'd ask about him.

494
00:28:43,836 --> 00:28:45,228
So, tell me,

495
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:47,525
When are you getting married?

496
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,134
Why are you asking about my marriage?

497
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:51,449
Just casually.

498
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:55,003
That's what girls ask each other, innit?

499
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:56,534
Tell me, then,

500
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,774
When are you getting married?

501
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:01,095
Just about anytime now.

502
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,602
I'm getting engaged tomorrow.

503
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:08,373
What happened?

504
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,291
Why have you gone silent?

505
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,426
I'm a bit surprised.

506
00:29:12,426 --> 00:29:13,758
What a coincidence,

507
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:16,764
Someone else is getting engaged tomorrow, too.

508
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,234
Afzal?

509
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,456
The one whom Afzal loves.

510
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:22,910
She's somewhere in Hyderabad.

511
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,778
Did he tell you that?

512
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,742
When a lover flees from a city,

513
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:29,521
One could think his lover lives there, innit?

514
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:31,208
Tell me her name.

515
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,199
Don't you know?

516
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:35,336
Her name's Farah.

517
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:37,341
I only know her name.

518
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,921
She's been writing him letters for years.

519
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:42,594
I'd read a handful of letters, too.

520
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:45,110
She opens with 'Dear Afzal',

521
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,107
And who knows what else she writes...

522
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:50,149
So that's some other Farah?

523
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:51,168
Obviously.

524
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:53,358
As if I write him letters!

525
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:56,541
She's getting engaged today, too?

526
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,946
Splendid...

527
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,579
That is grand.

528
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,534
It'll be grand now, Farah.

529
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:04,361
All three will get engaged on the same day.

530
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,719
Who's the third one?

531
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,664
Afzal.

532
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,980
Afzal?

533
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:13,838
He's getting engaged tomorrow, too?

534
00:30:13,838 --> 00:30:15,427
To whom?

535
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,403
To me.

536
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,227
I mean, he was asking me,

537
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,727
But I didn't agree to it.

538
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:25,120
Why?

539
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,420
I felt like he was calling out,

540
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,173
'Is there anyone who'd get engaged to me'?

541
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:33,348
Now, if one'd ask Yasmin like this,

542
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:34,952
Would Yasmin ever say 'Yes'?

543
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:37,885
I refused point blank.

544
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:39,773
Good.

545
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:42,556
But it won't do any good.

546
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:43,715
What do you mean?

547
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:45,445
He'll get engaged tomorrow, Farah.

548
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,976
At all costs.

549
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:50,492
Is there anyone else, too?

550
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:53,593
I mean, to whom if not you?

551
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:55,108
It could be anyone.

552
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:58,305
If he didn't get that muppet Farah, does it mean he won't get any girl out there?

553
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:01,068
He'd find someone better.

554
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:02,983
He's a handsome lad, beaut.

555
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:04,482
Talks little,

556
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:05,977
But hears a lot;

557
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:09,300
Who knows how many would die for him!

558
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,310
Did he flatly say,

559
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,624
'Get engaged to me'?

560
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,631
Obviously.

561
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:16,374
And you refused.

562
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,352
Point blank.

563
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:22,827
I thought the two of you had something going on.

564
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:24,386
We could've had...

565
00:31:24,386 --> 00:31:27,435
But I don't compromise on my principles. No.

566
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:31,143
What do I do, and what could love do, if he'd come from Hyderabad robbed?

567
00:31:31,143 --> 00:31:36,568
Love has emphathy for robbed travellers, not affection.

568
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,403
I'll disconnect.

569
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:41,043
Should I give you his number?

570
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,824
No; what'd I do with his number?

571
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:46,095
Ask about the time of the engagement and the girl's name,

572
00:31:46,095 --> 00:31:47,920
Or you'll be left asking me.

573
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,053
No way.

574
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:53,004
I just asked because his mention came up.

575
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:54,530
Alright, listen,

576
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,675
You'd keep your phone on, wouldn't you?

577
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:58,452
Why are you asking that?

578
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:03,029
I'd tell you if I found out the girl's name and the time of the engagement.

579
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,158
There's no need.

580
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:08,633
But my phone will be on.

581
00:32:10,545 --> 00:32:12,136
Good night.

582
00:32:12,568 --> 00:32:14,377
Good night.

583
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,372
Why are you laughing?

584
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:18,890
I'm laughing at the amount of flannel in love.

585
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,962
If only someone starts playing with it,

586
00:32:20,962 --> 00:32:24,027
It plays with one like a child plays with his toys -

587
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:25,351
Playing in the morning,

588
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:28,561
And breaking it by the evening.

589
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,353
Get up, Lubna.

590
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:53,867
Get up.

591
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,271
Tell me,

592
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:57,230
What happens next?

593
00:32:57,757 --> 00:32:59,363
Next, as in?

594
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,356
What's up with you?

595
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,766
Easy there, sit down and talk.

596
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,754
Your predictions have been true.

597
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:08,943
More than half of them, actually.

598
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:10,335
He's getting engaged tomorrow,

599
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:13,459
And he'd proposed Yasmin first.

600
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,342
He's getting engaged to Yasmin?

601
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:18,278
No. Yasmin's said she won't get engaged to him.

602
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:21,675
And now, he's looking for someone else.

603
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:23,280
For whom?

604
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,006
He'd find another.

605
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:26,350
'He's a handsome lad',

606
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,761
'Plus, he talks little',

607
00:33:27,761 --> 00:33:29,905
'But hears a lot'.

608
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,496
What are you saying?

609
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:32,639
I'm not saying this,

610
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:34,263
Yasmin is.

611
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:36,467
Did you just talk to Yasmin?

612
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,703
Yes.

613
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,110
I couldn't sleep, so

614
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,898
I thought I'd talk to her.

615
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:43,046
She let the cat out of the bag

616
00:33:43,046 --> 00:33:44,931
The moment I started talking.

617
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,616
That's good.

618
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:47,775
What's good?

619
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:51,464
The blighter's counter-attacking me!

620
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:54,213
What do you call a counter-attack?

621
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,175
He's getting engaged on the day of my engagement.

622
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,922
What does that mean?

623
00:33:57,922 --> 00:34:00,826
Why didn't he fix any other date?

624
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:04,468
So much right is the least he's got.

625
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,294
After all, he's a Molvi's son,

626
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,326
So, he's only being as cruel as his own fate had been to him.

627
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:10,484
What do you mean?

628
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:11,489
Honestly?

629
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,099
He should've gotten married by now.

630
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:18,253
In fact, he should've had one or two kids by the time you got married.

631
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:20,012
Don't you have the slightest sorrow?

632
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:23,422
Just tell me what your sorrow is.

633
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,319
Not sorrow,

634
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,987
But I feel pity.

635
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,224
He should be ashamed.

636
00:34:27,224 --> 00:34:30,561
Nobody in his family knows that he's getting engaged.

637
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,079
Like we care, even if they don't know!

638
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,468
Call Arifa.

639
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:35,901
Why?

640
00:34:35,901 --> 00:34:37,462
Let her know, too,

641
00:34:37,462 --> 00:34:39,918
What the brother whose name fuels her pride

642
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,482
Has been up to!

643
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:44,549
You'd give her new grief?

644
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,359
I'd just inform her.

645
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,663
How many days have we wasted, looking for him!

646
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:50,580
Now that we've gotten wind of his exploits,

647
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,976
We're duty-bound to inform her instantly.

648
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,073
Call her.

649
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:04,515
You might even die of sorrow...

650
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:05,935
That which you'd tasted

651
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,226
Was not blood,

652
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:10,827
But the soot of disgrace, Lubna Ibrahim.

653
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:25,910
Yes, Lubna?

654
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,196
Not Lubna, it's Farah.

655
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:29,338
Everything alright?

656
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,146
Tell me after you've heard the news

657
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:34,082
If everything about it is alright.

658
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:35,902
What's the news?

659
00:35:35,902 --> 00:35:39,559
He's fixed his engagement on the day of my engagement.

660
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,687
Who?

661
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:43,006
Your brother, obviously.

662
00:35:43,006 --> 00:35:44,152
And would you look at that!

663
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:47,567
He's neither told you, nor invited you to the engagement.

664
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,652
He's getting engaged today?

665
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:50,876
Splendid.

666
00:35:50,876 --> 00:35:53,713
Mum would dance a jig to hear it!

667
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,815
Dance a jig?

668
00:35:55,815 --> 00:35:59,341
Wouldn't she feel sad at all that he's not invited you?

669
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,101
Not at all.

670
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,136
She'd say,

671
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,915
'The son's become an outsider, Arifa',

672
00:36:03,915 --> 00:36:06,033
'But the daughter-in-law's our own'.

673
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,974
Who's the daughter-in-law -- I mean,

674
00:36:07,974 --> 00:36:10,878
Whom is he getting engaged to?

675
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,997
He'd offered Yasmin first,

676
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,480
But she didn't agree.

677
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,811
But he agreed didn't he?

678
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,947
So, he'll get engaged.

679
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,688
Have you seen Yasmin?

680
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,865
Why are you asking that?

681
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:27,364
Just asking.

682
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:30,104
I thought I should know how she looks.

683
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,479
She looks good,

684
00:36:31,479 --> 00:36:33,350
But she's very lippy.

685
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,744
If she looks good, a tad lippy will do.

686
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:38,992
Disconnect; I'll tell Mum.
-Listen!

687
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:40,488
Yes?

688
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:44,242
What'd you do with that ring now?

689
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:48,052
Have earrings made from it.

690
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,210
Our Afzal --

691
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,940
Is getting engaged today, Mum...

692
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:06,996
Did you say anything?

693
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:13,846
No? Why, what is it?

694
00:38:14,157 --> 00:38:18,314
I felt as if you'd said, 'Our Afzal's getting engaged today'.

695
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:22,095
No way...

696
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:25,296
It's

697
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,395
Farah's engagement today.

698
00:38:27,395 --> 00:38:31,392
That's sunken into your heart.

699
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,540
Go to sleep.

700
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:19,968
Hello?

701
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:21,943
Yasmin here.

702
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,399
Yes?

703
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:26,955
Didn't my refusal shock you?

704
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:30,778
I'd known that you'd refuse.

705
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:32,770
So, who'd you get engaged to?

706
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,388
You won't get any girl in this chaos.

707
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:39,016
I won't, if not with you.

708
00:39:39,016 --> 00:39:41,362
I've fallen asleep, thinking that.

709
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:44,345
So, how would you exact your revenge?

710
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:49,557
What you consider my revenge is my wish.

711
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:53,043
It's beyond my control, but I wish

712
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:57,831
That my wedding procession come the same day her wedding procession comes to her.

713
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:01,295
You'd stay true to your word, won't you?

714
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:04,696
I can't guarantee that...

715
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,756
Alright, I'll guarantee it.

716
00:40:06,756 --> 00:40:08,623
Find out the time of her engagement,

717
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,156
And come over.

718
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:13,387
I'll get engaged to you.

719
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
