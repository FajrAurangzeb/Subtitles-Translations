1
00:00:07,858 --> 00:00:13,548
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:18,826
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,826 --> 00:00:23,983
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:30,409
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:35,987
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:40,857
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:24,951
Sit down.

8
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,706
Have your breakfast.

9
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:26,998
I'll get it.

10
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:28,422
I will get it myself.

11
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,912
Come on, my good man,

12
00:01:29,912 --> 00:01:31,910
Sit; Have your breakfast.

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,514
She'll get the phone for you.

14
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:36,032
Why are you ringing with the phone?

15
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,750
Bring it, my dear.

16
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:58,237
Farah speaking.

17
00:01:58,358 --> 00:01:59,898
I know you won't say anything

18
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:00,637
But that's okay.

19
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,459
Just listen carefully.

20
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,578
You'll be invited to dinner tonight.

21
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:06,569
You'll be delighted to hear this,

22
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,404
But don't use 'Don't worry'

23
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,709
When acting out your delight.

24
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,349
Say as soon as you get the invitation,

25
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:13,359
'Thank you, sir'.

26
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,956
'I'll be there on time'.

27
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,215
Are you listening?

28
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:19,033
Well,

29
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:19,953
You would be.

30
00:02:19,953 --> 00:02:21,170
Next,

31
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,337
You won't come to dinner tonight.

32
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:25,376
At 9.15, I'll call you, worried,

33
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,922
Asking you

34
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:28,767
Why you're not coming.

35
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:31,390
Disconnect the moment I call you.

36
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,155
I mean

37
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,136
No response.

38
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:34,940
Then,

39
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,154
You will keep your phone switched off until 9 a.m. tomorrow.

40
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:40,183
At 9.01 tomorrow,

41
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:41,999
I'll talk to you again.

42
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,266
I'll tell you then

43
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:45,812
What you're supposed to do next.

44
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:01,858
Here.

45
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:03,356
It got disconnected.

46
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,976
Alright.

47
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:11,107
Have a look and see who's called you.

48
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,579
Must be a friend's.

49
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,521
After all, it's Sunday.

50
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:18,552
Someone must be calling me to play cricket.

51
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:21,033
This is the good type of cricket, isn't it?

52
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,722
Yes.

53
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,957
When will you have your breakfast?

54
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:39,885
We will.

55
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,374
Monseigneur's asking.

56
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,066
About

57
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,174
15 minutes from now?

58
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:49,905
Did that gag you?

59
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:52,259
This is called crisis management.

60
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,726
I figured last night

61
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,083
If he came today,

62
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,234
As you said he would,

63
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,985
His parents would be invited in a few days.

64
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,367
That starts a chain reaction, now, doesn't it?

65
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,790
Plus, our Dad

66
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,724
Is such a quick decision-maker!

67
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,755
One of these meetings, he'd call me,

68
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:10,662
Have me sit before Molvi Sahab,

69
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:11,645
And say,

70
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:12,942
'Here, Molvi Sahab'!

71
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,345
'Begin in God's name, and put the ring on her'!

72
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,719
He'll begin in God's name,

73
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:18,035
And I'll begin a monody!

74
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:18,964
And there

75
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:20,552
I'd be gone for good, Lubna!

76
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,727
Out of Mehtab

77
00:04:21,727 --> 00:04:23,805
Into Afzal!

78
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:32,501
Why aren't you saying anything?

79
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,328
At least appreciate me!

80
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,860
I am appreciating you.

81
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,463
So far, it's happened as you'd thought it would.

82
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,666
So it has been.

83
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,908
And so, fear God, Farah Ibrahim!

84
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:50,059
Only God has such power.

85
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,871
Everything happens as He wills.

86
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,371
You're bent upon scaring me!

87
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,470
You'll know about crisis management

88
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,768
When something unprecedented will happen!

89
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,337
What will happen?

90
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,043
That's what's not known.

91
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:06,931
But I have a hunch

92
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,432
God suddenly stops

93
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,501
A person from becoming a God himself!

94
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:38,274
Hello?

95
00:05:38,274 --> 00:05:40,264
Am I talking to Afzal?

96
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,183
Yes. It's me.

97
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:43,604
You --?

98
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:46,153
This is Sheikh Ibrahim speaking.

99
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:46,948
Yes --

100
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,106
Sir, I recognised your voice.

101
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:50,579
Peace be upon you, sir.

102
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,492
And upon you, peace.

103
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:54,388
How are you, my good man?

104
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:55,962
I'm good.

105
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,440
Fine.

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,948
It feels like you're lying when you say 'fine'.

107
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:01,919
Not at all, sir.

108
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,727
I don't lie very often.

109
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,466
In fact, I used to,

110
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,466
But not at all now.

111
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,728
Alright. Tell me you're not busy in the evening?

112
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,737
No.

113
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,182
Not at all.

114
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:15,938
Can you meet me at 9?

115
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,983
Of course I can, sir.

116
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:18,989
Alright,

117
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:21,511
Then we'll meet at 9 for dinner at my house.

118
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,110
Sharp at 9 o'clock.

119
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,248
Right, sir.

120
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:28,239
Shall I send a car at a quarter to 9?

121
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,189
No, sir.

122
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,565
It's just about two furlongs.

123
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:32,721
I'll be there

124
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,675
If I just sauntered down the road.

125
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,899
If it rains, if you get drenched,

126
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,704
Come regardless.

127
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:39,878
I will, sir.

128
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,450
You don't worry.

129
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,358
Okay; Bye.

130
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,468
Hello?

131
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,157
Did you get the invitation?

132
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,182
I did.

133
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:05,942
Then do as you've been told.

134
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,789
You don't worry.

135
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,517
Leave it to me.

136
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,587
I hope you remember everything?

137
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:12,882
Of course.

138
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,166
Alright; tell me,

139
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,929
Why don't you say anything

140
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:18,612
When Farah calls you?

141
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,892
I can't bring myself

142
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,892
To say something to her.

143
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,983
It's gotten too far, Mum.

144
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,159
He's going to their place for dinner tonight.

145
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,327
Where?

146
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,354
To that girl's place!

147
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,404
But there's one thing I don't get.

148
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,808
The younger sister's inviting him,

149
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,403
And the elder sister's stopping him!

150
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:50,713
What do you mean?

151
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:52,782
I mean, the elder sister's a tad haughty

152
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,326
And so, she's throwing a spanner in the works.

153
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:58,826
God only knows what you're saying and what you want to tell!

154
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:00,420
Stay tuned

155
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,421
For one breaking news after another.

156
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,339
Get a few new gowns ready.

157
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,015
And

158
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:08,465
Send the jewellery you've kept in the chest for polishing.

159
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:11,170
I'm auguring a gathering one of these days.

160
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,901
There, now!

161
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:18,541
It's not as if he'd want to be handfasted to any Mary, Jane or Susie and Molvi Sahab will say, 'Praise the Lord'! [=Subhanallah]

162
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,344
'Get ready and come with me, Ruqaiyya',

163
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,400
'I bear glad tidings that we've found a daughter-in-law'.

164
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,001
She's no Mary, Jane or Susie.

165
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,626
You'd be awestruck to hear about her!

166
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:29,351
You'd turn to look at your Afzal over and over,

167
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:30,493
Repeating,

168
00:08:30,493 --> 00:08:32,718
'The blighter's hit a jackpot'!

169
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:36,165
Fear God, Arifa, you're calling your elder brother a blighter!

170
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,110
I was just --

171
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,834
Saying it as you!

172
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,176
You do say it occasionally.

173
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:42,755
So what if I say it?

174
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,083
It's rather rude.

175
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,606
Take these away for washing.

176
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,247
Stop him!

177
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,266
Hey --

178
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,436
Stop!
-Leave him!

179
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:06,910
Step a--
-Why are you beating him?

180
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,916
The bugger borrowed a hundred thousand for one day!

181
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,774
And now he says he'll return it next month!

182
00:09:12,774 --> 00:09:16,326
Why don't you step aside?
-Halt!

183
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,892
As if this would solve anything!

184
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,075
Did you borrow a hundred thousand?

185
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,798
Yes.

186
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:31,399
What did you do with it?

187
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,344
Lost it in a match.

188
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,901
Will you get your 100,000 Rupees back if you batter him?

189
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:46,477
Even his father would give me the money!

190
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:48,582
Don't bring in his father.

191
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:50,617
His father won't give a penny.

192
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:53,525
Stop playing Dad [=guardian] to him and step aside!
-Hey!

193
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,742
I'll get my money at all costs!

194
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:56,416
I know how to lend,

195
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,775
And I know bloody well how to collect!
-Take his money, then

196
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,018
Not his life.

197
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:01,016
Will you give me the money?

198
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:02,343
I'll give you.

199
00:10:02,343 --> 00:10:03,223
Oh?

200
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,626
So you would give me the money.

201
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:05,576
Yes.

202
00:10:05,576 --> 00:10:07,704
Take your money from Sajid at 8 p.m.

203
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:09,372
8 p.m. means 8 p.m.

204
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,449
Rest assured; I mean it when I said it.

205
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,106
Come and collect your money.

206
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:14,779
Make yourself scarce now.

207
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,983
I'll deduct 2,000 Rupees if I saw your face before 8.

208
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,269
Go!

209
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:23,380
Begone, you bugger!

210
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:27,382
Thank you, mate!

211
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:29,021
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,707
Mr 'Thank you'!

213
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,896
Pull out 2,000.

214
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,506
2,000?

215
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:36,017
I have 98,000.

216
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,955
So,

217
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,463
You'd actually give him a hundred thousand?

218
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,038
I'll have to give him the money

219
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,090
Now that I've given him my word.

220
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,970
Now, give me 2,000.

221
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,528
Take all of it!

222
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,401
I don't want all of it, mate!

223
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,044
Just 2,000.

224
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,999
Here.

225
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:59,425
And make yourself scarce 'round here.

226
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,649
If Dad saw you,

227
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,104
You'd be deemed worthy of being murdered [the ultimate sinner]!

228
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,418
Go, now.

229
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,077
Alright, then.

230
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:09,367
Tell your father that Babloo

231
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,760
Won't ever gamble from this day on.

232
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,271
I'm under your oath.

233
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:29,595
What's this?

234
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:32,699
I'm thinking of what I'd wear tonight.

235
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:33,863
Splendid!

236
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,436
You're so serious

237
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,079
As if he's actually coming tonight!

238
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:40,031
Why don't you tell Mum too?

239
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,665
She's preparing some cates for real!

240
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,604
You daft demoiselle,

241
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:48,798
One's got to prepare to act or act to prepare.

242
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,029
And you must stand out from all of us

243
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,098
Full of colours!

244
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,858
Lost, dreaming of someone,

245
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,107
Dressed to impress!

246
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:57,421
What?

247
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,059
How else would Dad know

248
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,658
That you're delighted he's coming?

249
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,956
Forget for now

250
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:05,856
That you've asked him not to come.

251
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,237
Imagine he's coming

252
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,730
He'll come,

253
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,151
And the wait drives you mad:

254
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:12,580
You're eyeing the clock every so often,

255
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,248
Checking your makeup in the mirror,

256
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,984
In fact, even if you don't need it,

257
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:20,107
Retouch your makeup just to show Mum!

258
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,185
Turn away

259
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:23,548
If your gaze falls on Dad,

260
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:25,231
Act coy and move aside.

261
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:28,637
It'll only work if you do all of this.

262
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,800
What'll work?

263
00:13:32,153 --> 00:13:33,309
It's strange

264
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:34,528
That you've hatched up this plan

265
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:36,277
And I'm filling you in on the details!

266
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,795
Tell me.

267
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,033
Look, sweet damsel,

268
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,618
When he doesn't show up at 9,

269
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:42,877
And switches off his phone at 9.15,

270
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,822
Won't Dad redden with rage?

271
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:47,485
And seeing your preparations will only add fuel to his fiery fury!

272
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:49,482
Sure will!

273
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:51,353
Then, instead of saying yes to him,

274
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:52,325
Dad will say to you,

275
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:53,604
'Think carefully, girl',

276
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:56,313
'You've still got time'.

277
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,231
Sit back and think, then.

278
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,176
For 4, 6 or even 10 or more months,

279
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,541
Take a year or two if you will!

280
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,255
And then, say to him,

281
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:05,142
'Dad',

282
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:06,937
'I've realised my mistake'.

283
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:10,252
'Afzal's not the right type'.

284
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,438
Then?

285
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:12,228
What, then?

286
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,560
You've been bailed out of Mehtab,

287
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,278
And Afzal will fall like a house of cards.

288
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,574
You pack your bags for London!

289
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:21,228
Where are you off to?

290
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,604
Let me see, too,

291
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:25,042
What I'll wear tonight!

292
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:46,429
Here.

293
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:48,110
Here's your suit.

294
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,136
Thank you!

295
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:55,909
Thank God I got there on time!

296
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,455
The bleedin' laundryman

297
00:14:57,455 --> 00:14:59,504
Had bundled your suit with your Dad's clothes

298
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,720
To send it to your house!

299
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Whoa!

300
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,582
And thank your Dad too

301
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,463
For he said the moment he saw it,

302
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:09,194
'This suit isn't Afzal's'!

303
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:10,734
Dad was there too?

304
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:12,207
He'd just arrived.

305
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:15,409
I greeted him and skedaddled!

306
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,577
Good.

307
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:18,124
You're going there again, aren't you?

308
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,532
Yes.

309
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,833
You'd wear the same suit today?

310
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,651
Is this your suit or your uniform?

311
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:26,383
I'd gotten all drenched in the rain that day

312
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,037
I couldn't show it off nicely.

313
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,379
I will today!

314
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,309
When I'd purchased this,

315
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,603
She liked it.

316
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,330
I hope you're very happy!

317
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,240
Let me tell you in advance that your father's going to say yes to him!

318
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,404
Hey!

319
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:06,365
Why are you so agitated?

320
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,864
Not at all!

321
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:09,365
She's not agitated...

322
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:11,879
She's just a bit demure...

323
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,842
Anyway,

324
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,678
This isn't how you look demure!

325
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:16,280
C'mon!

326
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,410
Here.

327
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:27,216
Would you look at this!

328
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:30,514
How sweet she looks!

329
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,984
Why hasn't he come yet?

330
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:43,642
It may be that he's a few minutes late...

331
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,859
How come?

332
00:16:45,859 --> 00:16:49,341
I'd asked him to be here sharp at 9 o'clock!

333
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,176
Should I call him, Dad?

334
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:54,218
I'll call him.

335
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,076
Right,

336
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,620
Where are you, my good man?

337
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:10,861
Okay.

338
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:13,943
He's not coming?

339
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,430
Why won't he?

340
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:16,529
Go and get him inside,

341
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,779
He's at our doorstep.

342
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,363
It was still 10 seconds to 9

343
00:17:36,363 --> 00:17:38,039
When I was at your doorstep.

344
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,050
Your father called the moment I thought I'd ring the bell.

345
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,450
I hope I look good?

346
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,946
Your father thunders when he speaks!

347
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,213
The first thing he said over the phone was

348
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,823
'Where are you, my good man'?

349
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,844
I greeted him in a moment,

350
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,547
And he quietened.

351
00:17:56,547 --> 00:17:59,245
I'd called to ask you if you remembered everything

352
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,922
And you'd replied, 'You don't worry'.

353
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,349
Yes?

354
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:08,805
So was this what was asked of you?

355
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,732
Come in now.

356
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,838
Peace be upon you, Uncle.

357
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:31,473
And upon you, peace.

358
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,730
You're looking handsome!

359
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:35,859
Thank you, sir.

360
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:36,825
Peace, Aunt.

361
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,795
And upon you, peace.

362
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:39,783
How are you?

363
00:18:39,783 --> 00:18:41,113
I'm fine.

364
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,443
Sit.

365
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:46,649
After you.

366
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,256
I have some other chores to see to,

367
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:54,193
Sit here and talk to Uncle for now.

368
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,187
Please, sit.
-Alright.

369
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,649
Thank you.

370
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,642
And why are you sitting here?

371
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:00,935
Come with me

372
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,109
And sit with Farah.

373
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,987
At ease.

374
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:18,301
I won't ask you anything that will require you to strain your mind for no reason.

375
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:38,725
Why has he come?

376
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,682
He doesn't know either.

377
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:41,598
The blighter!

378
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,393
I won't give him one penny!

379
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:45,159
He doesn't need the money anymore.

380
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,033
For he'll be getting you along with everything in your bank account!

381
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:50,694
Shut your gob!

382
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,602
It's more than his face is worth!
-Don't talk about his face.

383
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:56,282
The rapscallion looks so dashing!

384
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:59,508
He's wearing the same black suit again.

385
00:20:10,946 --> 00:20:13,525
What are your ambitions?

386
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,994
Have you ever thought what you'd do,

387
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,875
What you'd become?

388
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,517
Not at all.

389
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,248
But I'm looking for a job, sir.

390
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:24,440
I've not told Dad that I've been ousted from the old one.

391
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,931
Hasn't he found out?

392
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:32,069
How would he when I've not told him?

393
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:33,490
I leave

394
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,238
Every morning as if going to my office,

395
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:38,363
And come back in the evening.

396
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,346
Dad thinks I'm coming back from the office.

397
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:42,632
But I'm

398
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:44,947
Trying, sir.

399
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:48,039
You should be thankful I've not told him.

400
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,321
Thank you very much, sir.

401
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:52,553
Have you ever thought about the status

402
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,498
Of the one you love?

403
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:01,664
How she spends her life?

404
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:06,172
Why?

405
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,828
I've never been able to bring myself to believe

406
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:13,432
That I could ever get married to her.

407
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:16,479
Has she never asked you either?

408
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:20,423
She must have told you not to gamble on matches!

409
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:21,913
No.

410
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,919
So she says you can?

411
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,812
She doesn't say so either.

412
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:27,836
Surely, you aren't nervous?

413
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,200
Not at all.

414
00:21:31,466 --> 00:21:35,490
Imagine, I accept your marriage to her,

415
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,301
And in four months, you do, indeed, get married to her.

416
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,026
What will you do then?

417
00:21:40,026 --> 00:21:42,626
What are your career prospects?

418
00:21:42,626 --> 00:21:48,617
What are your ambitions that I can trust to assure me that you'll be able to keep her happy?

419
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:51,249
One doesn't trust career prospects, sir;

420
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:54,482
It is the man whom one trusts.

421
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:57,013
And I have full confidence in myself.

422
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,875
I'll earn to be able to feed her.

423
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,477
I'll do everything I can to keep her happy.

424
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,983
At first, I couldn't believe it, Farah!

425
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:30,177
I couldn't bring myself to accept that he's come!

426
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:31,262
When I opened the door,

427
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,219
He was before me, smiling shamelessly!

428
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,374
How you'd repeated everything to him

429
00:22:36,374 --> 00:22:38,541
That he should say when he's invited, 'I'll be there',

430
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,090
But he's not to come!

431
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:43,021
And yes

432
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:44,980
You'd also said to him,

433
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,837
'Switch off your phone at 9.15'!

434
00:22:48,974 --> 00:22:51,594
What good will it do to remember this?

435
00:22:51,594 --> 00:22:53,451
Who's thinking of any good?

436
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:54,795
I'm just estimating

437
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:57,176
The potential damage!

438
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,762
Shut up!

439
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,150
Splendid!

440
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,413
It's killing me to worry about you,

441
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,481
And you're saying 'Shut up'!

442
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:06,121
Alright, I will shut up!

443
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,683
But listen to one final thing

444
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:11,728
You'll be cursed by that blighter Mehtab!

445
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:14,820
Where are you going?

446
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:16,529
Just --

447
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,017
I'll take a stroll around the house.

448
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:19,919
It's better that I ask when we'd have dinner

449
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,375
Than sit by your side quietly!

450
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:24,585
You're concerned about the food, Lubna!

451
00:23:24,585 --> 00:23:26,602
So should I stop eating too?

452
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:27,991
Just because

453
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,943
He showed up despite instructions not to!

454
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,543
And why are you worrying?

455
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:35,363
What happened to your 'crisis management'?

456
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:36,634
Now that he's here,

457
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:37,597
Just take it as if --

458
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:40,492
Imagine, rather, you've called him here yourself!

459
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:43,245
Meet him like you'd meet a dolor non grata -

460
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:45,223
Beckon to it, give it a place in your heart,

461
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,067
And then say to it,

462
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:49,799
'To the dickens with you'!

463
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:01,730
To the dickens with you!

464
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:14,090
And if I told you that your marriage to Farah isn't possible,

465
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,890
How would you react?

466
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:23,027
I wouldn't react, sir.

467
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,415
Why?

468
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:27,433
Won't you feel sorrow?

469
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,547
It didn't seem likely I'd say yes after today's meeting.

470
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,605
Surely, I would feel sorrow, sir,

471
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:37,258
But I've come here with the firm belief that I don't deserve her.

472
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:41,000
I have nothing, sir.

473
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,465
Just dreams...

474
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:47,061
But I don't have reason to believe they'd ever come true.

475
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:51,292
I do say that I'd do everything I can do keep her happy,

476
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:55,534
But how long will I keep trying; how long she'd be happy with me...

477
00:24:55,534 --> 00:25:00,091
The truth, sir, is that I don't even come up to Dad's expectations.

478
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:03,411
And you're her father.

479
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:13,057
You're getting nervous, aren't you?

480
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:14,336
Not at all.

481
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:15,719
Then why don't you say

482
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:18,288
'I'd react if you reject me'?

483
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,871
'I'll take a stand against everyone for her'!

484
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,618
Because I never would, sir.

485
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,828
Even for her, I'd never take a stand against her father.

486
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:30,777
I can take a stand against everyone else.

487
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:41,113
How many suits do you have like this one?

488
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,837
Just this one, sir.

489
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,565
It's nice.

490
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:48,135
It suits you.

491
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:49,838
Thank you, sir.

492
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:52,092
Wear this one when you come tomorrow.

493
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,385
Come where, sir?

494
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,001
To the office.

495
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:58,050
Sharp at 9 o'clock.

496
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:03,014
The same as you do everyday.

497
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,945
Right, sir.

498
00:26:04,945 --> 00:26:07,432
I'll be there at 9.

499
00:26:36,505 --> 00:26:38,110
Don't say anything!

500
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,407
I'd found out before you entered this room.

501
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:42,921
You bring bad tidings.

502
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:43,963
Okay.

503
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:45,619
Just hear as much

504
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:47,840
That the meeting's over,

505
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,399
And it's time for dinner.

506
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,860
Retouch your makeup

507
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,468
And get to the dining room, double time!

508
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:54,662
It's quite possible

509
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:56,094
That the moment you get there,

510
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,414
Dad will

511
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:01,329
Announce his surrender before your love!

512
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,950
Your father says Arifa would know where he is.

513
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:31,417
Dad's right in saying so.

514
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:34,109
When will he be back?

515
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:35,882
He would, soon enough.

516
00:27:35,882 --> 00:27:38,798
An hour at the most?

517
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:46,680
I can swear to you

518
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,096
I won't even mention it to your father,

519
00:27:49,096 --> 00:27:50,922
But at least tell me

520
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:52,404
Where he's gone

521
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,699
And who she is.

522
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:58,004
Ask all you will about her looks, and I will tell you.

523
00:27:58,004 --> 00:28:02,216
But I won't tell you her name without his permission.

524
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,975
Just pray that he succeeds today!

525
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:11,646
I won't pray before I hear her name.

526
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:13,028
Well,

527
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:15,688
Love doesn't need prayers.

528
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:17,913
Why doesn't it?

529
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:19,370
Oh?

530
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,341
Wouldn't Majnun's mother have prayed for him?

531
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:25,535
And Ranjha's mother, I've heard, died in his childhood.

532
00:28:25,535 --> 00:28:28,904
But Punnun and Farhad's mothers were fine.

533
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,376
Did their prayers work?

534
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,487
They didn't, did they?

535
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:36,793
So has my Afzal become Majnun [ = crazed in love]?

536
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,934
Speak something good, would you?

537
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,885
Let your mouth utter only good things.

538
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,223
Don't look at how their love ended, Mum.

539
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,889
Look at their place.

540
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,996
The poor ones died in the absence of a second option,

541
00:28:47,996 --> 00:28:52,685
Else the legends would be talking about their children too!

542
00:28:57,717 --> 00:29:00,057
Don't worry, Mum.

543
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:04,814
You Afzal will be the most excellent ['Afzal'] of them all!

544
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:59,137
How do you eat at home?

545
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,205
Dad says

546
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:04,791
One should eat with one's hands, so that's how...

547
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,478
So eat with your hands.

548
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,224
It's no good acting coy and running away now.

549
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,621
Sit.

550
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:55,639
Why don't you eat, my dear?

551
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,060
Why did you stop?

552
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,551
Sure.

553
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,274
I'm sorry, Dad...

554
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:15,372
But please don't proclaim any decision just yet.

555
00:31:20,316 --> 00:31:24,098
I want to talk to Afzal about something.

556
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,130
Just for ten minutes?

557
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:35,775
And Lubna will be with me.

558
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,043
Please?

559
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:43,442
Okay.

560
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,879
I have no objections.

561
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,916
Talk to him about it.

562
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,124
Thank you, Dad.

563
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:09,816
Would you be done with it quickly?

564
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,759
Should I

565
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,759
Keep standing, or may I sit?

566
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,059
Sit!

567
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:10,462
You'd said

568
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,922
You'd not come.

569
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:16,146
Who'd said it?

570
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,992
So you're acting here as well?

571
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:20,572
You loafer!

572
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:22,928
I'd said it.

573
00:33:22,928 --> 00:33:24,260
I'd called you myself!

574
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,377
I'd repeated everything to you to make it clear!

575
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,175
No you didn't?

576
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:34,438
No as in?

577
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,706
You didn't call me.

578
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:39,389
You didn't explain anything.

579
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:41,905
Would you look at that!

580
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:45,074
How he can look me in the eyes and lie to me!

581
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:47,684
I didn't look you in the eyes...

582
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,655
Didn't lie either.

583
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:52,404
Farah had called before my eyes

584
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,646
Using my cell phone.

585
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:55,720
She was explaining everything elaborately!

586
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,656
I was listening to it here as you were over there!

587
00:33:57,656 --> 00:34:00,216
I swear by God, no!

588
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,050
I didn't hear a word of it!

589
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,202
He's telling the truth.

590
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,683
He's swearing by God.

591
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:17,153
So was I

592
00:34:17,153 --> 00:34:20,020
Talking to my angels?

593
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,358
What's the matter?

594
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:27,114
I mean

595
00:34:27,114 --> 00:34:29,616
Did you ask me not to come?

596
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:30,945
Exactly.

597
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,113
Good Lord!

598
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,522
But who answered the phone, then?

599
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,827
Whom did you talk to?

600
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,329
Did I say anything?

601
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:42,582
Have you ever said anything in reply?

602
00:34:42,954 --> 00:34:45,210
You quieten the moment you hear my voice!

603
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,489
You don't even say a 'yes' or 'okay'!

604
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,957
I do wish you peace [greetings].

605
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,260
What do I do now?

606
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,277
What did Dad say?

607
00:34:59,277 --> 00:35:01,417
He's called me to the office tomorrow.

608
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,488
He said he'd meet me there.

609
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:05,260
You won't go there.

610
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,930
How can that be?

611
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,342
How could I disobey him?

612
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:09,949
How could you disobey me?

613
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:13,462
You're serving me for 200,000 a month!

614
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:17,539
But you'd said the designation is a grand one!

615
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:20,732
She's calling me a servant!

616
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:23,586
You're worried about your designation?

617
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,383
Just a minute, Farah.

618
00:35:25,383 --> 00:35:27,019
Care to tell me

619
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,236
What you'd do if Dad proclaimed his decision

620
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:31,984
Of getting the two of you married?

621
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,992
What could I do in that case?

622
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:36,921
So you'd marry me, eh?

623
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,416
No, I didn't quite say that.

624
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,338
You're just being naïve, Farah.

625
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,180
He isn't here to get married to you.

626
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,392
Just tell me

627
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,570
Do you have a way out if Dad proclaims his decision?

628
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,815
My brain's paralysed, Lubna!

629
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,123
You'll see in a while

630
00:35:51,123 --> 00:35:52,682
As my heart stops beating too!

631
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:54,532
Don't get all worked up like that.

632
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,610
Let Dad proclaim his decision.

633
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,664
What?

634
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:59,555
He'll not just proclaim his decision,

635
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:01,080
He'd kiss him as his own,

636
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,381
And seat him on the exalted throne as his son-in-law!

637
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:04,788
What will I do then?

638
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,234
And what will he do then?

639
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,460
Perfidy?

640
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:13,478
That's what had been decided upon, isn't it?

641
00:36:13,478 --> 00:36:15,212
He'd act to love you from the depths of his heart,

642
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:18,128
And then break yours.

643
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:28,317
Right!

644
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:31,017
I'd forgotten it!

645
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,258
And it isn't my fault either.

646
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:37,468
After Mehtab's chapter closed, I'd begun to think

647
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:41,866
He, too, should do his job, take his money, and get going!

648
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:43,141
Look,

649
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:45,807
Four months of acting is something that neither I can do, nor he.

650
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:47,063
I can.

651
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:48,565
What can you do?

652
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:49,906
I mean,

653
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:52,179
I'll show my love

654
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:53,973
As long as it's necessary.

655
00:36:53,973 --> 00:36:57,040
And when it's required that I be perfidious,

656
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,109
I would be perfidious.

657
00:36:59,109 --> 00:37:01,100
Do it tomorrow.

658
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,238
Splendid.

659
00:37:02,238 --> 00:37:03,603
Dad will say yes today,

660
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:05,968
And he'd two-time you tomorrow!

661
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:06,820
Don't you think

662
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,539
It's too early?

663
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,140
It's been ten minutes already.

664
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:33,478
Come, Mademoiselle.

665
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:35,686
Monseigneur says it's been ten minutes.

666
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,869
Alright.

667
00:37:38,136 --> 00:37:38,937
Listen.

668
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:40,423
If Dad talks about the marriage,

669
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:41,393
Say,

670
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,457
'Alright, thank you'.

671
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:44,395
Don't say anything else.

672
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,397
I won't.

673
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,730
And if he said,

674
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,755
'Bring your parents one of these days',

675
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:51,274
What would you say then?

676
00:37:51,274 --> 00:37:52,886
I'd say, 'Alright'.

677
00:37:52,886 --> 00:37:53,735
'Thank you'.

678
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:55,356
Are you nuts?

679
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,225
Don't you dare talk to them

680
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:59,462
Or bring them here!

681
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:01,254
No -- I won't.

682
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:02,828
I'd say, 'They can't come'.

683
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,837
'T -- Talk to me'.

684
00:38:04,837 --> 00:38:06,417
What will he talk to you about?

685
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,917
And why would he talk to you about the marriage?

686
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:12,790
What should I tell Monseigneur?

687
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,883
Tell him we're coming in ten minutes.

688
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:16,090
Alright, listen.

689
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,241
You don't need to get nervous.

690
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:19,919
Stand firm with your love for now,

691
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:22,194
We'll work on the schedule -- for your perfidy later.

692
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:23,367
Come with me, now.

693
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,396
Okay?

694
00:38:24,396 --> 00:38:25,386
C'mon!

695
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,590
Come.

696
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
