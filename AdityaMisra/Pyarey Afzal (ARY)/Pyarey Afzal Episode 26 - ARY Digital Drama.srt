1
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:13,661
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:18,909
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,909 --> 00:00:24,009
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,454
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,655
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,095
He's talking about running away!

8
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:16,482
Although I scolded him the moment I heard it,

9
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:20,415
His words have stuck with me.

10
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,369
It's no problem to you,

11
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:24,917
Whether he stays here or runs away,

12
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,620
And runs away to Yasmin or someone else,

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,799
It won't change anything for you.

14
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,842
I do have a problem.

15
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,920
I was thinking about

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,513
What'd happen to you.

17
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,690
What'd happen to me?

18
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,393
He's running away from you, too.

19
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:41,162
As in, he doesn't love you, either.

20
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,667
He is in love,

21
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,159
But he's afraid to speak up.

22
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,924
He's not expressive.

23
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:47,486
Go and talk to him,

24
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:48,838
Have him swear on you...

25
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:49,942
Say that,

26
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,039
'May he leave this place'

27
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,602
'Over my dead body'!

28
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:53,555
Hey!

29
00:01:53,555 --> 00:01:56,001
That'll sort everything out.

30
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,504
If he swore on you and left,

31
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,915
Just think

32
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,527
That he's very expressive.

33
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:02,123
That he says the truth to someone's face.

34
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,023
No way!

35
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,053
If I have him swear with such audacity,

36
00:02:05,053 --> 00:02:07,084
He'd think I'm head over heels for him.

37
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,696
Then tell him you're head over heels for him.

38
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:09,905
What's the shame now?

39
00:02:09,905 --> 00:02:11,514
It isn't about shame...

40
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:14,618
A girl's got to have some ego, Farah.

41
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,813
Should I talk?

42
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:17,774
I'll talk,

43
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:18,595
And have him swear.

44
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:21,285
Hold on, Farah! What are you doing?
-Let go of my hand!

45
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,807
I won't let the blighter run away from everywhere!

46
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:25,970
Look at how much Mum and Dad are running around for him!

47
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,999
He should understand what that means, shouldn't he?

48
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:28,916
And

49
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,119
How much longer will you keep singing 'I've tasted blood'?

50
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:32,388
Your voice is bad, sure,

51
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,407
But your feeling surely isn't, right?

52
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:36,080
Wait, Farah! What are you doing?

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,241
Listen to me!

54
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,175
By the Lord!

55
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,941
Did you see that?

56
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,307
It's happened, hasn't it?

57
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,519
What has happened?

58
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,312
Afzal's run away!

59
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,549
What?

60
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,902
He told the doctor, 'I've started walking now',

61
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:13,228
'I'd run away by the evening'.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,590
That's very unfortunate, Irsa...

63
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,770
What would I tell Molvi Sahab, now?

64
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,116
Why should you tell anything?

65
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,646
He'd have to answer himself!

66
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:23,660
Why are we responsible for his doing?

67
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,754
Hold it, Farah!

68
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:30,285
Just think of where he'd go in the condition he ran away in!

69
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:32,238
To Yasmin's?

70
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,320
Well, you can't think of anything else!

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,606
So, where'd he go?

72
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,952
Looking for Wali.

73
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:39,428
The one who'd murdered Babu Hamid.

74
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,147
And remember, all of you,

75
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:48,793
Everyone would hear very bad news by the evening if he found Wali.

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,394
Who knows what'd befall Molvi Sahab...

77
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:04,346
The next bit of news might as well kill him.

78
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,313
Can you see that?

79
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:43,084
This way leads to Sea View.

80
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,431
That means

81
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:50,848
The sea is right where it once was.

82
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,889
Alright, now...

83
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:57,529
Ask how far their place is.

84
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,457
How far is it, good man?

85
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:04,908
We'd be there in 15 minutes.

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,649
Please, Ruqaiyya Begum,

87
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,920
Hold on to yourself today.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,100
Don't slap him in your fury.

89
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,543
Right...

90
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:24,183
Many people hear the whack of a slap,

91
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,113
And if Farah and Lubna

92
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,785
Happen to be there,

93
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:33,547
You could safely say that all of Karachi is listening.

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,386
Good evening, Modryb.

95
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:49,313
Good evening.

96
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:51,155
Come in.

97
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,521
I can't believe it, Modryb.

98
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,462
You'd believe it when the two of you have met.

99
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:58,715
What's this, Wali?

100
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:00,681
You've brought your cronies along today, too?

101
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,736
No, Modryb, they're not cronies.

102
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:05,381
I've got a wedding procession with me.
-Oh?

103
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:07,809
So you've fully prepared, too?

104
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:08,828
Come in.

105
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,488
C'mon.

106
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,281
Good evening.

107
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,039
Very very good evening.

108
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,275
Sit.

109
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,830
How --

110
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,070
How much I've fought for this one moment.

111
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,630
I'd even been so discourteous to my Modryb...

112
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,250
Please, forgive me, Modryb.

113
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,617
What's this apology for, Wali?

114
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:51,208
One gets discourteous in love and war...

115
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,605
Tea, or coffee?

116
00:06:54,929 --> 00:06:56,430
Coffee today.

117
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,528
Just a moment.

118
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,134
Seriously, though, Wali,

119
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,853
You killed Babu Hamid for nothing.

120
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,402
The poor lad was a nice man.

121
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,951
She still cries in his memory.

122
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:10,810
Tell her not to, Modryb.

123
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,836
One doesn't cry for any other man.

124
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,155
Besides,

125
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:18,985
Murders happen in love and war.

126
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:25,390
Do you see how lively she is, Modryb?

127
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,356
I'll take you along tomorrow!

128
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:30,150
Tomorrow?

129
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,238
The day after, if not tomorrow.

130
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,772
As you say.

131
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,750
Now, I'd only do as you say, Modryb.

132
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,792
Then, take her today.

133
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,430
There won't be a tomorrow.

134
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,517
Why, Modryb?

135
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,639
Do you fear anyone?

136
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,140
Yes, that's right.

137
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,580
Afzal, you know...

138
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,030
He's fine now.

139
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,856
He's started walking.

140
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,683
So?

141
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:49,794
So what?

142
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,418
I'm afraid.

143
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,872
She was drawn to him in the beginning.

144
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,330
What do you mean? She'd fallen in love?
-No.

145
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,936
Not love; just fondness.

146
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,183
Fondness, though, as in,

147
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:02,987
Fondness today, love tomorrow.

148
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,688
Easy there, don't worry.

149
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:08,190
Have your coffee.

150
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,020
Sit tight, Wali,

151
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,555
Or I'll fill you with lead.

152
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,870
Do you know how much thoughtful labour it takes to brew a cup of coffee?

153
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,597
The poor lass has put a lot of effort making it.

154
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,744
You'd have spilt it if you'd run away, wouldn't you?

155
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:40,300
Alright,

156
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,034
Drink it.

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,087
Drink it sip by sip.

158
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:50,843
I'll sit here and watch you drink coffee until then.

159
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,592
The two of you have conspired against me, haven't you?

160
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,980
You've handed me over to the enemy.

161
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,516
I've recovered you through them.

162
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:10,542
I didn't have the time to look for someone like you.

163
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,190
How could I do everything else if I'd kept looking for you, eh, bugger?

164
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,797
Why are you looking at the window?

165
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:23,443
Your four minions

166
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:27,140
Won't come to help you one bit.

167
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,436
Ask why.

168
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,904
Why?

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,036
The four of them are all dead.

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,328
Alright,

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,736
Have your coffee.

172
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,444
Here.

173
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:16,325
Peace be upon you.

174
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,670
And upon you, peace.

175
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,154
Now, before asking

176
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:22,730
How we are, quickly tell me

177
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,420
Where the blighter is!

178
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,202
I feel like exchanging blows with him first!

179
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:31,272
This way, isn't it?

180
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:31,820
Yes.

181
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,635
Come.

182
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:46,825
Afzal!

183
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:49,070
Afzal!

184
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:52,199
You blighter! You've been caught!

185
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:54,700
I'm here now!

186
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,797
I've brought your Mum and Arifa along!

187
00:10:58,797 --> 00:11:00,950
Afzal!

188
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,748
Where is he?

189
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,328
Please, sit down and have some tea.

190
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,326
We'll talk.

191
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,256
There, now.

192
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:25,372
We haven't come here to talk, Monseigneur.

193
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:28,030
We've come here to meet him.

194
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,850
Please, allow us to meet him.

195
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,394
This meeting is not possible, Madame.

196
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,820
He's left.

197
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,543
Where's the key?

198
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,887
In my pocket.

199
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,621
Take it out.

200
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,445
No, my dear --

201
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:20,989
I didn't ask for water...

202
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,420
Give it to her,

203
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,270
She's crying a lot.

204
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,707
Aunt, why don't you have this?

205
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,250
It'll ease you a little.

206
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,454
No, my dear.

207
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:36,135
I've been eased.

208
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,453
I've shed a few tears when the moment came,

209
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:41,437
So, I've been eased, so to speak.

210
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,929
Why don't you have it, my dear?

211
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:52,801
You haven't even shed a single tear.

212
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,874
There!

213
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,112
She's been eased, too.

214
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,230
Get up, Molvi Sahab.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,200
We should turn back and leave,

216
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,537
Or the night will be a long one.

217
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,839
How can that be, Madame?

218
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,750
If we have to go back, we'd leave together tomorrow morning.

219
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,435
We'd have to go back, Monseigneur.

220
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,641
He's gone,

221
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,012
And so are we, you could say.

222
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:57,979
Look, he didn't tell me anything before leaving.

223
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:01,346
It's possible that he'd come back.

224
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,657
That's something I like about you, Monseigneur,

225
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:11,626
You put a dying soul on a ventilator.

226
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:15,988
You never let one's hope die out.

227
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:22,366
He's left his things here.

228
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:26,063
That means he'd come back.

229
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:31,552
The guard told me that he said he's going to get a cigarette.

230
00:15:32,192 --> 00:15:35,581
He's started smoking, too?

231
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,610
He'd smoke a few now and then there, too...

232
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,108
He doesn't have any such habit, really...

233
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,470
Would you happen to have sleeping pills?

234
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,987
No problem if you don't have any.

235
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:59,557
She'd stay awake

236
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:05,760
Even after taking one,

237
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,135
And when she stays awake,

238
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:13,051
She doesn't let me sleep.

239
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,381
Where are his things?

240
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,842
In that room.

241
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,380
Where are you off to, Ruqaiyya Begum?

242
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:52,658
The rapscallion leaves his scent behind even after he's left.

243
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:01,295
He's left us,

244
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:06,014
Let me see if he's given up that habit, too.

245
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,780
Afzal...

246
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,330
My Afzal...

247
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,198
I used to make aeroplanes like that in my younger days.

248
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:24,537
Tad would be delighted to see, and say in a lively voice, 'You'll see, Arifa',

249
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,810
'My son will become a pilot one day'.

250
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,335
Arifa?

251
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,790
Arifa was my Mam's name.

252
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,694
Hey!

253
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,921
My sister's name is Arifa!

254
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,598
Surely, your Mam's name isn't Ruqaiyya?

255
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:39,021
Yes!

256
00:18:39,021 --> 00:18:41,080
My Mum's name is Ruqaiyya.

257
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,270
How do you know?

258
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,154
Ruqaiyya was my younger sister's name.

259
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,210
So you'd kill me?

260
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,703
I don't want to kill you either.

261
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,643
It would pain my Dad a lot to hear

262
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:18,884
That a faithful one has killed another.

263
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:22,888
It'd pain me, too.

264
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,917
But, you bugger,

265
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,766
You took the life of a faithful man,

266
00:19:29,766 --> 00:19:33,784
And killed another deep inside?

267
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,917
Forgive me.

268
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,407
That's it...

269
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,108
I've been thinking about that, too.

270
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,730
But how can I forgive you?

271
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,130
Alright.

272
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,660
Tell me something positive,

273
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,993
Hearing which

274
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:03,209
I could have mercy.

275
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,335
Afzal, I can be very useful.

276
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,593
I'm Najju's right hand man.

277
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:11,064
I've seen that you're made of the right stuff.

278
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,582
Come with me, I can introduce you to matey.

279
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:15,329
You can do his work

280
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:18,148
And earn millions.

281
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:19,960
What

282
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,732
Is this matey's name?

283
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,233
Najju.

284
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:26,655
He's committed 16 murders.

285
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,437
He marches about the city,

286
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:34,122
But the police don't dare raise an eye at Najju.

287
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:36,386
Call your 'matey'.
-What's the need to call?

288
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:37,575
Come with me,

289
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:40,955
I'll seat you right before him.

290
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,714
Call him.

291
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,247
A -- Alright -- Phone...

292
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,522
Aye, matey, it's me, Wali.

293
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:06,398
Go on.

294
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,945
Why are you so scared?

295
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,710
No, matey --

296
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,559
I'm not scared --

297
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,510
I'm negotiating with Afzal.

298
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,300
I'm having a deal with him.

299
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,054
Who's Afzal?

300
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:24,453
I'm Afzal.

301
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:26,213
Afzal Subhanallah.

302
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:28,389
Who are you?

303
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,110
Just like there's a 'matey' backing every hoodlum,

304
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,020
Every 'matey' out there's got his oul fella.

305
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,813
I've asked you who you are.

306
00:21:38,813 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm your oul fella, Najju.

307
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,298
I've just gotten this post.

308
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,750
Give the phone to Wali.

309
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,519
Wali, --
-Listen, Najju!

310
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,946
Talk to your oul fella.

311
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:57,542
Later on, you'd think that it'd have been better if you had.

312
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,737
Alright,

313
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:01,593
Make a deal with me.

314
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:03,801
What deal?

315
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,677
Give me a good mansion,

316
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:08,663
Two cars,

317
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,936
And 5 million.

318
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:14,159
It'll prolong your life.

319
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,195
Or else?

320
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:17,080
What'd you do?

321
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,718
It's simple, Najju,

322
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,033
I'd kill you.

323
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:23,166
You bleedin' --
-No, no...

324
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,621
Don't abuse me.

325
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:26,433
I won't take the money after such abuses.

326
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:29,041
I'd take your life.

327
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,193
Alright, disconnect now.

328
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:38,994
And when you offer prayers for Wali tomorrow, pause and think

329
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:42,741
Why no one's given the call to this prayer,

330
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:46,196
Because, Najju, matey,

331
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:51,245
Death doesn't knock before coming in.

332
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,286
So you'd kill me?

333
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:02,990
That's what I've been thinking about.

334
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,640
It's my first murder,

335
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,280
And that scares me.

336
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,690
Please.

337
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,102
Sit.

338
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,560
Everything's alright, isn't it, Monseigneur?

339
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,530
Yes, everything's fine so far,

340
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,910
But if this night passes off fine,

341
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:02,685
You'll get good news in the morning.

342
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:04,926
So,

343
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:09,460
Why, then, are you worried, Monseigneur?

344
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Look,

345
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,390
I --

346
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,750
Otherwise have a lot of courage,

347
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,520
But, seeing you in this perplexed state,

348
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,730
My courage has begun to break.

349
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,360
That is precisely why I'm talking to you in solitude.

350
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,560
If Madame

351
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,719
Heard it, she'd start wailing.

352
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,529
Wailing?

353
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,987
Look...

354
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,904
Your son...

355
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:50,054
He's alright, isn't he?

356
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:53,077
Yes, he's fine, but...

357
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:58,507
He'd taken two bullets to his leg a few days ago.

358
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:01,116
That was nothing serious, really,

359
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:04,993
He was fine in a few days, but...

360
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:07,639
B -- b -- but?

361
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:12,192
The same people murdered his friend, Babu Hamid.

362
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,747
Just a few days ago.

363
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,890
You're listening, aren't you, Molvi Sahab?

364
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:23,996
Yes?

365
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:27,153
He's gone looking for them,

366
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:32,342
Especially the lad who'd murdered Babu Hamid.

367
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:39,428
What'd he do

368
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:41,869
When he's found them?

369
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:44,930
You tell me what he'd do.

370
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,823
You know him better.

371
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,226
Ruqaiyya!

372
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:15,773
Ruqaiyya!

373
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,178
Ruqaiyya!

374
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:23,750
Come, Ruqaiyya Begum!

375
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,440
Pack your things.

376
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,564
'Tis the reckoning.

377
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,505
Afzal isn't coming back.

378
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:45,222
Afzal isn't coming back...

379
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,520
Afzal isn't coming back.
-Afzal!

380
00:27:00,338 --> 00:27:04,114
He's not coming back...

381
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,702
There's no turning back from where I stand now,

382
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:50,370
And you're going back

383
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,824
From where you've come.

384
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:55,956
Listen to me, Afzal,

385
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:59,730
5 million, 2 cars, a nice mansion -- I can give you.

386
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,150
Just spare me.

387
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,940
I won't even walk down Yasmin's alley again. If you see me, you can shoot me dead.

388
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,890
Surely, you won't, Wali.

389
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,510
But what would I do?

390
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:18,860
How would I walk past the cemetery where there's a new grave of one Babu Hamid?

391
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:25,540
Isn't it a question

392
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,467
You don't have the answer to?

393
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,900
I've been seeing Babu Hamid in my dreams for four days without a break.

394
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,177
He says, 'You'd mocked the Lahoris, eh'?

395
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:45,770
'Tell me, now',

396
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:50,492
'Are Hyderabadis weaklings'?

397
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,581
You're unknown in this city.

398
00:28:57,581 --> 00:29:00,864
Here dwell the kind that'd swallow you whole without opening their mouths!

399
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,282
Join hands with me,

400
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,289
And you'll see

401
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,716
Where I take you.

402
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:11,080
Your words enrage my friends.

403
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,603
Come here, Babloo.

404
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,241
Take his phone.

405
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,718
Najju's number is saved in it.

406
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:46,660
Forgive me, Wali,

407
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:53,110
But I can't remember Dad's words at this moment;

408
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,486
All I can see is Babu Hamid's face.

409
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,126
Give my regards to Babu Hamid.

410
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,213
I said call him here.

411
00:31:35,213 --> 00:31:39,157
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

412
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,311
Strange.

413
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,216
He's fearing me

414
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:48,602
And I him...

415
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,600
Dad!

416
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,575
Forgive me for all my sins!

417
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:59,294
For God's sake, forgive me!

418
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,330
You blighter!

419
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,040
You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

420
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,876
And you'd leave those who love you

421
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:19,774
In Hyderabad?

422
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,230
Why didn't you wake me up?

423
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:50,761
No one needs any waking up in this house now, my dear.

424
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:55,220
I knew that you were awake.

425
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,530
She is, too.

426
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,696
Take care of her.

427
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,305
In the Lord's protection [Goodbye].

428
00:33:03,305 --> 00:33:06,537
It's raining heavily outside.

429
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,146
Ah, yes --

430
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:11,161
I can see that.

431
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,108
What happened?

432
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:22,580
I've been slapped hard in the face.

433
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,559
I've been told not to go out.

434
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,941
Henceforth,

435
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:32,427
Someone else will lead the prayers.

436
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,433
Who's told you, Dad?

437
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:39,624
Who could it be except Him?

438
00:33:39,624 --> 00:33:43,369
How would He accept, now,

439
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,983
That a hoodlum's father

440
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:50,382
Should go about his priestly duties at the Mosque?

441
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:54,848
He's forcefully retired me.

442
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:58,621
Get up, Ruqaiyya Begum!

443
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:04,833
The prayer and time are both slipping from our hands.

444
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,256
You may leave.

445
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:44,220
I'll prepare it.

446
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,331
You get up at daybreak everyday.

447
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:59,199
I thought you'd pray today.

448
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,496
Visit Hyderabad for once.

449
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:11,462
It'll ease you if you meet Mum and Dad for once.

450
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:12,899
I can't go there.

451
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,892
Why can't you?

452
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:20,893
Dad would've thundered his judgement on me,

453
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:25,650
Proclaimed me a sinner and spat on me.

454
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,698
He doesn't pronounce judgements anymore.

455
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,196
He's stopped going

456
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,084
To the Mosque for the last one month.

457
00:35:35,084 --> 00:35:39,989
He says, 'Priesthood is not proper for me'.

458
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,809
Who told you?

459
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,242
Alladio.

460
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:49,662
Where is he?

461
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,413
He's sleeping.

462
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,920
He'd die in agony if he doesn't go to the Mosque.

463
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,605
I know my virtuous Dad very well.

464
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:08,067
That's why I'm saying that you should go for once.

465
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:12,028
One look at the sinner's face would resurrect his honour.

466
00:36:12,028 --> 00:36:14,455
He'd insult me,

467
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:17,622
He'd say, 'Don't you dare set your foot at my doorstep'!

468
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:18,887
Or, he'd say, 'Ruqaiyya',

469
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:20,927
'Stop him'.

470
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:26,701
'Do not let him desecrate any part of my house beyond the doorstep'.

471
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,779
When it's a matter of virtuousness and sin,

472
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:33,116
Mum always supports him.

473
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:34,523
She'd say,

474
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,969
'Who are you, my good man'?

475
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:40,628
'Whom do you want to meet'?

476
00:36:41,777 --> 00:36:44,270
It'd kill me to hear that, mate.

477
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,479
Then sleep through daybreak.

478
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:50,050
Be done with this telepathy.

479
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,023
Every one of your family is awake at this hour.

480
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:01,108
Then, give me sleeping pills.

481
00:37:04,785 --> 00:37:06,889
5 mg.

482
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,684
I'll sleep through daybreak.

483
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,167
Yes?

484
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,957
Who are you?

485
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,980
Whom do you want to meet?

486
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,040
I'm Sajid, Samina.

487
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,860
So what if you're Sajid?

488
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,020
Whom do you want to meet?

489
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,440
You're deliberately not recognising me, innit?

490
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,210
Your name sounds familiar, you look familiar.

491
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,815
Look,

492
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:13,697
An enemy of my husband's is named Sajid.

493
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:14,860
Please, leave

494
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,479
If you're the same.

495
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,903
Please, leave.

496
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:22,145
That makes you

497
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:26,123
My enemy as well.

498
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,170
<i>... And there are distances now,</i>

499
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,160
<i>Someone was close to me,</i>

500
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,165
<i>And there are distances now...</i>

501
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:59,162
<i>Destined for man</i>

502
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:03,290
<i>Is such helplessness...</i>

503
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,600
<i>So what,</i>

504
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,350
<i>If he has altered course,</i>

505
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,250
<i>I'd stay quiet</i>

506
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,390
<i>Without aspersing and disgracing him...</i>

507
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:26,214
<i>How many are alive without their lov --</i>

508
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:32,179
The estate agent had come in the morning.

509
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:34,743
He said he's found a new tenant.

510
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:37,280
He'd pay 12,000 a month,

511
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,744
And he was willing to pay a year's advance.

512
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:45,977
I don't want the 12,000 a month or a year's advance.

513
00:39:45,977 --> 00:39:47,784
What do you mean?

514
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:49,990
No tenant will live in this house now.

515
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,665
The ones that came and left have been enough.

516
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:55,377
How would things go on?

517
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:58,689
The money saved up for my wedding

518
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,804
Are enough for four years.

519
00:40:00,804 --> 00:40:02,506
Won't you get married?

520
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,437
Why wouldn't I?

521
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:05,958
As long as that blighter is a 'Bhai' [hoodlum],

522
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,108
Marriage to him isn't possible.

523
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:09,961
The day he's no longer one

524
00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:12,846
Would be the day he'd come to me.

525
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:18,000
I wouldn't need so much money for the wedding then.

526
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
