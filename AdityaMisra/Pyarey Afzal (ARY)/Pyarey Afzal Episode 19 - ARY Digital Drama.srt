1
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:13,584
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:18,881
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:24,053
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,053 --> 00:00:30,352
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:35,945
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:40,677
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:35,545 --> 00:01:37,169
Come.

8
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:40,325
I've seen you.

9
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,427
Just ask quietly

10
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,657
Where I'd gone and whom I'd met.

11
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,579
Hey!

12
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,814
Whom have you met?

13
00:02:03,814 --> 00:02:05,861
As if you don't know at all!

14
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,285
I swear, Farah, I don't.

15
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:10,892
I'd gone to Arifa's place.

16
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:12,533
Arifa's place?

17
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,267
Yes.

18
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,423
I thought I'd sit with her for a while,

19
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:18,384
Comfort her.

20
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:22,845
So, could you comfort her?
-I tried the best I could.

21
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:24,938
The Lord will reward you for this.

22
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,277
You don't even think

23
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:30,907
Where you're going when going to comfort them.

24
00:02:33,316 --> 00:02:35,956
But she's very hard-hearted.

25
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,788
She isn't particularly grieved that her brother's left them.

26
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:41,416
So she didn't give you the photograph?

27
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,786
Photograph?

28
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:45,824
I'd dropped that idea long ago.

29
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,987
So, what did you talk about?

30
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,737
We

31
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:55,018
Were talking about the Farah who writes him letters.

32
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,936
Lubna, I think

33
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:00,895
He's eloped with her.

34
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,567
And you said this to Arifa, too?

35
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:07,495
I'm just telling you my guess.

36
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,725
And such wayward lasses

37
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,413
Are there the moment one calls them.

38
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,897
He'd have said, 'Come',

39
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:14,991
'Now's the chance'.

40
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:18,289
'Let's steal away together'!

41
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,104
She'd be living with him, now,

42
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,726
Without getting married.

43
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,717
But know what,

44
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,631
A tragic end awaits her kind!

45
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:30,959
Their end may be happy, too.

46
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,539
Perhaps the two of them have gotten married?

47
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,115
You're right.

48
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,837
I didn't even think of that.

49
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,605
And he's the son of a Molvi.

50
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:45,145
He'd know every nuptial rite!

51
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:47,006
Yes!

52
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,498
I'm beginning to understand what Arifa said now!

53
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,476
What did she say?

54
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,224
She said, 'He's left Hyderabad for Karachi'.

55
00:03:55,224 --> 00:03:57,387
'He'd be back when he's become something'.

56
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,543
The blighter!

57
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:02,646
He'll come back a father!

58
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,817
Mam!

59
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:53,253
Mam!

60
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,127
Get up. Wali's here.

61
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,441
Wali?

62
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,676
Where is he?

63
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,770
Open the door,

64
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,920
Or he'll create a scene before everyone.

65
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,393
Go back to sleep.

66
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:30,867
It's Yasmin's cousin.

67
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:32,160
He's the loafer type.

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,397
Whenever he's here, he rings the bell like this.

69
00:05:35,397 --> 00:05:38,909
Everyone in the family's got some issues!

70
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,379
But Yasmin's nice, boyo.

71
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,478
What is it?

72
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:01,911
Why are you here?

73
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,114
What's this, Modryb?

74
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,363
You'd ask your nai why he's here?

75
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,506
I'd said I'd be here on the 25th,

76
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,160
And it's the 25th today.

77
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,616
And I'd said to you on the same day that you don't need to come here.

78
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,879
What about you, Modryb, you say anything.

79
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,539
Step aside, will you? A quarrel between a Modryb and her nai doesn't look very nice.

80
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,440
We'll talk inside.

81
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:31,657
You can't come inside.

82
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,584
I'll have to make my way in if you stop me.

83
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,428
You might even get injured, Modryb.

84
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,549
Muster all your courage, boyo.

85
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:42,341
And try your Modryb's, too!

86
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:50,619
Babu Hamid!

87
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,203
Babu Hamid!

88
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,016
Hey!

89
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,586
She's crying for help!

90
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,133
Sit tight.

91
00:06:57,133 --> 00:07:00,790
Let her cry if she does.

92
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:06,989
Such an effete man!

93
00:07:09,507 --> 00:07:10,899
Babu Hamid!

94
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,461
Babu Hamid!

95
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,366
Hey!

96
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,243
Hey -- Boyo -- Afzal!

97
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:21,892
Don't do it, Modryb,

98
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,257
I'm getting angry.

99
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,272
Babu Hamid!

100
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,838
Alright.

101
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,246
Call him one more time.

102
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:30,824
If he comes, alright.

103
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:34,869
Otherwise, open the door yourself, Modryb.

104
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,276
What is going on?

105
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,230
Just --

106
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,322
I'm joking around with me Modryb.

107
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,430
Who are you?

108
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,649
Afzal.

109
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,784
I'm her tenant.

110
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,586
But she was calling Babu Hamid, wasn't she?

111
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,446
Where's the bugger?

112
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,274
Look,

113
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,922
Don't use foul words.

114
00:07:55,922 --> 00:08:01,665
It isn't proper to misbehave at your Aunt's doorstep.

115
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:03,671
You've just gotten up, haven't you?

116
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:05,186
Go back to sleep,

117
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:08,390
Or I'll put you to sleep right here.

118
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:19,426
What is your name?

119
00:08:19,426 --> 00:08:21,457
Answer me, sir.

120
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,121
Wali --

121
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:25,061
His name's Wali.

122
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:30,409
My Dad says it's not good to pick a fight,

123
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:37,629
But my heart says it's no better to desert a fight once it's started either.

124
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,898
This is your Aunt's house,

125
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,635
But you don't even enter your Dad's house without permission.

126
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:53,039
You're new here and I think nobody's told you about me.

127
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,313
Well,

128
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,043
Never mind.

129
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,625
I'll get going.

130
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,476
But don't take this meeting as my introduction.

131
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:08,013
Next time, I'll show you who this bugger called Wali really is.

132
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,661
Okay, Modryb.

133
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:12,024
I'll get going.

134
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,257
Take care of her.

135
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:17,178
I'll be dropping by any day this time.

136
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:19,708
God be with ye.

137
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:28,918
Thank you very much, my dear.

138
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,214
He didn't come in?

139
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:13,401
Sent the scoundrel away.

140
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:15,431
You sent him away and he left?

141
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:16,838
Don't say that, Mum.

142
00:10:16,838 --> 00:10:18,583
He isn't going away like that.

143
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,416
Afzal sent him away.

144
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,957
He understood it in a moment when he said it.

145
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,042
What do you mean?

146
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:25,547
He sent him away domineeringly?

147
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:28,769
Like Babu Hamid had?
-Yes.

148
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,593
Then the poor soul's dead.

149
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:31,499
Don't you remember

150
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,263
What he did to Babu Hamid?

151
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:34,404
I do.

152
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,529
But everyone should remember

153
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,685
It's only a man's duty to save a girl.

154
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:41,530
Whether the man's one's own or an outsider.

155
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,627
Whose duty, then, is it to save him?

156
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:46,046
The blighter would have ten men with him when he'd be back.

157
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,045
They'd beat him black and blue.

158
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,717
The poor man's our tenant, Mam,

159
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,703
Not our guardian.

160
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:57,952
In fact, he's not even properly our tenant.

161
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,510
What did he say as he left?

162
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,479
He said,

163
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,698
'I'll introduce myself when I come back'.

164
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,374
It's the same, then, isn't it?

165
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:11,777
He said one day, 'I break legs for an introduction'!

166
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:14,104
Oh God!

167
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:16,932
I'll tell him to vanish from here.
-Hey!

168
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:18,751
Hey! Listen!

169
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,251
Do you see this wound?

170
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:24,235
Look at this one, too.

171
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:29,536
The bugger struck me with a 2 kilo pistol.

172
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:32,654
It still pains me here.

173
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:33,935
Come on.

174
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:39,134
Gather all your things and make yourself scarce within 15 minutes.

175
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,280
Where would I go?

176
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,079
And why should I go?

177
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,569
Haven't I given you the money?

178
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,812
You have,

179
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:46,786
But Wali is going to pay you back

180
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,985
What you've given him, all with a tenfold interest!

181
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,731
When?
-What do you mean, 'When'?

182
00:11:52,731 --> 00:11:55,459
At least tell him not to come.

183
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,101
I'm the son of a priest.

184
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,600
I don't charge interest.

185
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,632
Do you even know what she's talking about?

186
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:02,354
Yes --

187
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,100
She's talking about the interest, mate.

188
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,006
I've told her

189
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,479
I'm not taking any.

190
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,995
They'll be bringing some 10 ruffians for interest,

191
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,397
They'd clobber your face until it's beyond recognition,

192
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,975
And that Wali will smite your legs for the sin of grabbing his collar.

193
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,478
At the very least.

194
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:20,226
Does he not have legs?

195
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:21,100
What do you mean?

196
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,091
It's clear what that means, Babu, mate.

197
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,825
An eye for an eye,

198
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:27,013
And a leg for a leg.
-What --

199
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,856
You want to be a hero?

200
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:32,738
You'd fight 10 men all by yourself?

201
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:35,645
He even carries a pistol!

202
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,591
That's odd, mate.

203
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,217
Dad wanted me to fear God,

204
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,013
And you're wanting me to fear His men?

205
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,451
For God's sak --
-Don't swear by God.

206
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,545
I know, too, that he'll be coming.

207
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,154
We'll see when he comes

208
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,447
How powerful ten ruffians can be.

209
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:54,542
Look,

210
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,866
Your have pretty face just like me,

211
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,290
But he only likes women with pretty faces,

212
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,895
He doesn't like men with pretty faces.

213
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:04,307
He'll mangle that face of yours.

214
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:04,932
Why

215
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,561
Don't you wait for him quietly?

216
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,247
Let him come.

217
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,026
Let him show what he can do.

218
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,384
I'm waiting for him, too,

219
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:17,770
And I don't like to wait.

220
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,668
This lad's going to die, Babu Hamid,

221
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:23,386
And get you killed too.

222
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,209
I'm going to get you breakfast.

223
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,161
Eat whatever you have for breakfast and lunch as if it's the last thing you'll ever have

224
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:35,881
For breakfast or lunch.

225
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:43,543
What does she think Wali is?

226
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:47,545
Who knows what you think Wali is.

227
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,062
He's not going.

228
00:13:58,062 --> 00:14:00,921
The lad's proper manly, Yasmin.

229
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,890
I saw his courage in the morning.

230
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,391
You'll get to see it again one of these days.

231
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:06,874
The 'proper manly' lad will be scurrying like a rat.

232
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:11,342
He won't even be able to eat if he got hurt around the mouth.

233
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,280
We have the things to make soup, right?

234
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,703
Is he asking for soup?

235
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:16,091
He isn't right now, Mum,

236
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,121
But he will, in a few days.

237
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,640
He'll only have soup for a week or two,

238
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,848
And if Babu Hamid is spared, he'll be having the bread.

239
00:14:23,848 --> 00:14:25,225
He didn't feel the sligtest of fear?

240
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,980
Not at all.

241
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,887
And Babu Hamid?

242
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,685
Didn't he tell, either, what kind of a tyrant Wali is?

243
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,855
He did.

244
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,949
The poor man was even showing his wounds,

245
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,449
And this lad was laughing.

246
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:42,190
What's this long 'hmm' about?

247
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,826
Thus beat the drums of war, O daughter of Fortune!

248
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,936
A ferocious battle shall mark the days to come,

249
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:51,264
As the forces of the righteous and the sinful shall clash,

250
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,468
And the sinful shall be disgraced.

251
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:55,295
What forces will clash?

252
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,143
Don't think of a single man as a force.

253
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:02,531
The ten or so blokes will crush him together.
-I've seen his eyes.

254
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:07,857
They're not the kind that would accept defeat.

255
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,466
Peace be upon you.

256
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,480
Sit.

257
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,207
That's what I'd come to say.

258
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,944
Mum had advised me,

259
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:06,936
'Go and tell Arifa to recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties]'.

260
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:23,954
Where's Lubna gone?

261
00:16:23,954 --> 00:16:25,781
To Arifa's.

262
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:29,222
It just occurred to me that they should recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties].

263
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,733
If they do, you should go too.

264
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:34,216
One should always do one's part in good deeds.

265
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,859
This could've been conveyed over the phone too.

266
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:39,297
Arifa's asked her not to call.

267
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,312
She says,

268
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:44,164
'When the phone rings, it feels as if Afzal's calling'.

269
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:46,358
'So, it's better that you don't call'.

270
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,576
'A ray of hope'

271
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:49,920
'Shines bright when the bell rings'.

272
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,677
Why has Afzal suddenly become so important to us?

273
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,215
Mum!

274
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:07,168
I'm asking you.

275
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,088
You've made him important.

276
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,792
Acted out love, and then an engagement,

277
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,221
And now it's time for 12 Labours of Farah to find him and bring him back!

278
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:16,324
12 Labours?

279
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:18,152
To find him and bring him back?

280
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:19,673
What are you saying?

281
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,572
I'm only saying what I am seeing,

282
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,562
And whoever's seen it

283
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,402
Is out of control.

284
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:28,494
You've turned everyone in the house around your finger.

285
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,152
Do you know what happened in the morning?

286
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,089
What?

287
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,534
Your Dad left his cellphone at home.

288
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,307
What's bad about that?

289
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,346
I've left my phone --

290
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,683
At home many times, too.

291
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,745
Listen to the whole thing, Farah.

292
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:44,216
He went and called me from the office, saying, 'Irsa, I've forgotten something important at home'.

293
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,244
I asked,

294
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:46,799
'What have you forgotten'?

295
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,588
He said,

296
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:50,229
'I'll call you when I can remember'.

297
00:17:50,229 --> 00:17:52,497
So, could he not remember?

298
00:17:52,497 --> 00:17:55,138
He could, the very next minute.

299
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:59,387
He called and asked, 'Any news about Afzal'?

300
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,871
Afzal?

301
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:07,653
He was referring to his cellphone as 'Afzal'!

302
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,660
Your Dad left his cellphone at home.

303
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,089
He went and called me from the office, saying, 'Irsa, I've forgotten something important at home'.

304
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:29,119
I asked,

305
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,736
'What have you forgotten'?

306
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,542
He said,

307
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,259
'I'll call you when I can remember'.

308
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,557
So, could he not remember?

309
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,836
He could, the very next minute.

310
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:43,758
He called and asked, 'Any news about Afzal'?

311
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,489
I swear by God I didn't say that.

312
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:49,607
Your seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you've gone mad.

313
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,932
Lubna?
-Just see one for once.

314
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:55,922
At least it'll satisfy everyone.

315
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,146
I'm your sister,

316
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:06,694
Which is why I double as a psychiatrist in times of need.

317
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,227
The truth is that your madness does not convince people!

318
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:10,569
Care to ask

319
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,439
What happened to Afzal's photograph,

320
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:16,474
And what Arifa said when I asked her for one?

321
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:17,806
What did she say?

322
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,834
She said you don't even deserve his photograph.

323
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:21,851
Tell me,

324
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,158
Do you?

325
00:19:23,158 --> 00:19:23,970
No.

326
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,439
Not at all.

327
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:36,109
<i>O Prophet, peace be upon you.</i>

328
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:40,561
<i>O Messenger, peace be upon you.</i>

329
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:45,030
<i>O Beloved, peace be upon you.</i>

330
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,314
<i>Prayers of the Lord be upon you.</i>

331
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,576
<i>O Prophet, peace be upon you.</i>

332
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:57,922
<i>O Your Majesty, peace be upon you.</i>

333
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:02,358
<i>O Beloved, peace be upon you.</i>

334
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:07,936
<i>Prayers of the Lord be upon you.</i>

335
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:45,167
Bowl -- You bowl, mate.

336
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,822
Molvi Uncle!

337
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,707
Molvi Uncle!

338
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,784
Yes, Babloo?

339
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:52,988
Why did you come here, Uncle?

340
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:57,181
What are you asking, my good man?

341
00:21:57,181 --> 00:22:01,176
I'd come to watch your cricket match.

342
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:04,545
In all honesty, I've only realised it today

343
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:07,006
That if you just play cricket,

344
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:08,790
There can be no better sport

345
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,760
Than cricket.

346
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,019
Hey, Babloo!

347
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:16,863
Why are you crying?

348
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:19,503
I am the one who'd dropped him.

349
00:22:19,503 --> 00:22:22,716
I'd had him board the train.

350
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,586
Don't stroke my cheek with affection.

351
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:26,815
Slap me, Molvi Sahab.

352
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:29,114
No.

353
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:34,306
The fault is not yours, Babloo, my dear.

354
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:37,967
If the one who's going is unbending in his intentions,

355
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:43,022
The fault never lies with the one who drops him off.

356
00:22:43,022 --> 00:22:44,362
Go,

357
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,941
And play,

358
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,271
But

359
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:51,205
Just play cricket.

360
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,571
You're sitting here!

361
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,733
I considered waiting at his doorstep to receive you,

362
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:16,769
But changed my mind later.

363
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,285
Care to properly tell me the reason for going there?

364
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:21,833
I'd gone to talk about the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties].

365
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:22,852
That's it?

366
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:24,332
That's all you talked about?

367
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:25,959
That's not what we talked about.

368
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,615
They were reciting the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties] when I'd gone there.

369
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,067
I recited too.

370
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:33,444
Splendid.

371
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:35,051
You folks think over here,

372
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:37,323
And they act on it over there.

373
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:39,599
Yes, it surprised me too.

374
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,098
But it felt great to see

375
00:23:42,098 --> 00:23:45,614
That everyone thinks alike in times of sorrow.

376
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:47,193
What's the sorrow with you folks?

377
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:48,364
Leave it, Farah.

378
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:51,755
You feel sorrow over his departure too.

379
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:54,399
Don't you?

380
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:58,074
You think so much about his Mum and Dad,

381
00:23:58,074 --> 00:24:01,468
You were even prepared to run an advertisement on TV.

382
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:04,323
It's a different matter that you changed your mind later on.

383
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:09,463
But your feelings have been made clear.

384
00:24:09,463 --> 00:24:12,045
From now, you're not going to his place without asking me.

385
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,182
Why?

386
00:24:13,182 --> 00:24:14,890
It's my friend's house!

387
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,701
How can you stop me from going to my friend's house?

388
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,012
Arifa's friends with me, too.

389
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:22,278
I go there too.

390
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:26,682
Do you know why she didn't invite me to recite the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties]?

391
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:28,147
Ask why she hadn't invited me.

392
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:30,404
Why didn't she?

393
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:32,233
Because the blame for Afzal running away

394
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,937
Has fallen on me!

395
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:35,045
Not at all.

396
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:37,217
No one's blamed you for anything.

397
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:39,312
That's their gentility.

398
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,780
But I know the fault lies with me.

399
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,792
That's why I've decided

400
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,946
That I'll leave no stone unturned

401
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:51,806
To wash this blame off me.

402
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,813
I thought this door leads to your place, so...

403
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:36,709
I came here on the pretext of handing you the utensils.

404
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,546
Pretext, as in?

405
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:39,489
No, it's --

406
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,660
Babu Hamid thinks

407
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,985
I've broken your heart.

408
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:47,156
I couldn't fall asleep.

409
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:04,936
Afzal!

410
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,905
Afzal, get up.

411
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:10,560
Get ready; he's here.

412
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,568
Has he come riding a motorcycle?

413
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:19,742
He's come riding motorcycles.

414
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:21,363
What do I do?

415
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:26,096
Open the door on the inside and go upstairs, jump across and get inside the house next to this one, alright?

416
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:28,406
I'm not talking about fleeing,

417
00:26:28,406 --> 00:26:29,561
But about fighting.

418
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:32,662
Don't think of doing anything stupid; you have little time,

419
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:33,482
Get up.

420
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:35,488
And leave this place. Get up.

421
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:37,262
I'll flee on one condition.

422
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,429
Go on.

423
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,764
Quickly.

424
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:43,596
If I run away,

425
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:46,206
You'd fight them.

426
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:47,036
Done.

427
00:26:47,036 --> 00:26:47,833
Go,

428
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,064
I'll fight them.

429
00:26:50,064 --> 00:26:51,899
You bugger!

430
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:53,236
You're a lone wolf.

431
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,771
They'll kill you.

432
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:55,893
What does it matter, boyo?

433
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:57,894
If they spare me, the cops will kill me.

434
00:26:57,894 --> 00:26:58,979
You'd better get out.

435
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,642
He hasn't knocked the door yet.

436
00:27:00,642 --> 00:27:02,316
I'd have to open it if he knocks,

437
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,783
Or he'd break through it.

438
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:07,565
You're a Lahori, aren't you?

439
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,633
Talk and act like a Lahori.

440
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,368
Why are you besmirching the reputation?

441
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:12,533
C'mon.

442
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,291
C'mon.

443
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,287
Where are you going, Mam?

444
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:00,834
Wali's not come.

445
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,296
It was just two lads showing off stunts on their bikes.

446
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:05,274
They've left.

447
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,990
C'mon, shake hands with me.

448
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,757
I used to think Babu Hamid was a coward.

449
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:33,565
I swear by you, I'm a right coward.

450
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:37,002
And I swear you're a coward too.

451
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:39,370
This courage is just a necessity.

452
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,235
One feels ashamed to die by the hands of one like Wali.

453
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:45,212
Who exactly

454
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,351
Is this Wali?

455
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,966
Yasmin's Mam is his Modryb.

456
00:28:49,966 --> 00:28:52,411
If she's his Aunt, why doesn't she let him in?

457
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,078
He's got his eyes on Yasmin.

458
00:28:54,078 --> 00:28:56,149
He says, 'I'll marry her'.

459
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:57,485
Doesn't she want to?

460
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,403
She'd rather spit in his face.

461
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,741
The bugger's an ace ruffian.

462
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:02,899
Hey!

463
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,618
She should just talk to him for a change.

464
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,803
If he loves her, he'd give up his thuggery.

465
00:29:07,803 --> 00:29:10,233
What'd he do with his wife?

466
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,196
He's already married.

467
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,226
And he had a 'love marriage' back then.

468
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:16,118
In fact, I've heard it wasn't his first 'love marriage'.

469
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:18,219
He's had one before that, too.

470
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:21,117
His 'love' lasts 6 months, and his 'marriage' 7.

471
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:22,624
He leaves the old one

472
00:29:22,624 --> 00:29:24,345
A month after his 'love' ends.

473
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,978
Why is his name Wali [Saint] then?

474
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:30,698
His name should be 'Lovely'.

475
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:36,775
The bugger's besmirching the name of every saint out there.

476
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,735
You gave me a fright there!

477
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,307
What happened?

478
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,043
I can't sleep.

479
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:52,493
Me neither.

480
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,699
Come.

481
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:58,197
Want some juice?

482
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,807
Yes, give me some.

483
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:09,833
Who said the thing about the psychiatrist?

484
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,892
I mean,

485
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:14,534
Whose idea was it?

486
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,268
Mine...

487
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:20,314
So you think I should see a psychiatrist?

488
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:21,848
No.

489
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:23,800
I don't now.

490
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,394
I think I was wrong.

491
00:30:25,394 --> 00:30:28,566
Don't say that.

492
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,275
I think you're right.

493
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,821
I should see a psychiatrist.

494
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:36,118
Why?

495
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,002
I mean, why do you think so?

496
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,439
I've started thinking about people

497
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,806
About whom I shouldn't really be bothered.

498
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:44,447
Who, for example?

499
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:45,932
Name a few.

500
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:48,248
For instance, I was just thinking about Mehtab.

501
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:49,540
I started thinking

502
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,830
That, seeing how he'd left my swing in flames,

503
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:56,588
How he must be up in flames all within himself!

504
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,010
Then? So what?

505
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,375
It's alright.

506
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,557
But I shouldn't really be thinking of him.

507
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:05,197
The thing is,

508
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,747
Deep down, you're a compassionate girl,

509
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:09,666
And, over time,

510
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:12,389
You're forgetting the sorrow of the burning swing,

511
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:14,527
And you're beginning to pity Mehtab now.

512
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,759
No, it's not that.

513
00:31:19,226 --> 00:31:19,990
Then,

514
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,084
What is it?

515
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,445
I'm thinking that Afzal

516
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:27,036
Has eloped with the Farah who used to write him letters.

517
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,068
That's why I should not go to Karachi.

518
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,865
Where's the logic in this?

519
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,918
There's logic in this, Lubna.

520
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:35,152
If I chanced upon him in Karachi,

521
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:38,322
He'd think I've come to Karachi for him, wouldn't he?

522
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:39,497
Although

523
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:44,400
It really feels so cheap to even think of it.

524
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,805
Find out

525
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:48,306
Who the best psychiatrist in Hyderabad is.

526
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,462
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.

527
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:53,728
Good night.

528
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:54,603
Good night.

529
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:57,092
Also,

530
00:31:57,092 --> 00:32:00,236
Mum and Dad must not know about it.

531
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:01,930
Don't worry.

532
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,541
Promise?

533
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,743
Promise.

534
00:32:24,672 --> 00:32:26,922
Yasmin!

535
00:32:29,295 --> 00:32:31,638
Yasmin!

536
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,823
Yasmin, get up!

537
00:32:34,823 --> 00:32:37,839
What is it, Mam?

538
00:32:41,746 --> 00:32:43,713
I'm very afraid.

539
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,362
You're a grown-up and yet afraid, Mam?

540
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:48,260
You've grown up.

541
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,996
That's why I'm afraid.

542
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,516
It's 2, Mam.

543
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:56,923
He won't be coming now.

544
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:02,146
It's better if he does come tonight.

545
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:07,617
At least this long night of waiting for tomorrow will end.

546
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:10,318
Shall I get you some tea?

547
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,725
Alright.

548
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:28,482
What happened?

549
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:31,418
He's come now.

550
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:32,923
Give me the gun.

551
00:34:32,923 --> 00:34:35,276
Give it to me!

552
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:42,545
You won't open the door.

553
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,386
The bugger's laughing!

554
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,256
Putting up a show of courage?

555
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:04,292
I give you another chance to save your life:

556
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:08,559
Get me up on your shoulders and drop me before my Yasmin.

557
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,214
Ahh!

558
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:17,060
So that's why your Aunt doesn't let you in!

559
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,731
Yes or no?

560
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:20,779
Alright,

561
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:22,362
Let's rather not fight.

562
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:23,824
Your name's Wali [Saint].

563
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:25,731
At least live up to your name, mate.

564
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,641
Yes or no?

565
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,859
Had you been in Hyderabad,

566
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:33,473
Your cronies would be pleading before you with their hands folded,

567
00:35:33,473 --> 00:35:36,178
'Save your life, Wali',

568
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,566
'Don't ruffle Afzal's feathers'!

569
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:40,702
Yes or no?

570
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,160
Hey!

571
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:21,503
I'll give you a right beating, you bugger!

572
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:26,535
My second punch will break your jaw!

573
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:45,901
As if you will deliver a single blow, M. Wali!

574
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:49,522
It's your crony who's doing the dirty work.

575
00:36:49,522 --> 00:36:51,898
Wait.

576
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:55,774
I'll handle him myself.

577
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:58,670
You bleedin' --

578
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,350
Pakku, Nasir, Wahid --

579
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:01,414
Take out your pistol and fill the bugger with lead!

580
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:11,069
Hit the bugger.

581
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:15,559
I'll handle the shooters.

582
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:25,236
Nobody here takes a bullet or a beating for someone,

583
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:29,188
And only those fear the gun who don't have one themselves,

584
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:32,908
Or lack the guts to fire one.

585
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:36,443
I'm the son of Molvi Subhanallah, M. Wali,

586
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,220
And he used to tell me,

587
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,627
'Death stands guard over life',

588
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:42,711
'Do not fear it';

589
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:45,001
'Fear life'

590
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:50,970
'For it will kill you off where you'll not have the slightest relief'.

591
00:38:53,566 --> 00:38:55,080
Begone, now!

592
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,424
I'll spare you.

593
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:03,029
That's alright,

594
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:06,030
Thank you very much.

595
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:11,950
But I won't spare you, Wali.

596
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,878
I was never, in my Dad's eyes, a good son,

597
00:39:17,878 --> 00:39:23,169
But never did he grab my collar, you bugger!

598
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:49,760
Quiet!

599
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,404
Don't scream!

600
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:05,537
People will remember your screams and laugh at you!

601
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,007
What are you looking at here and there?

602
00:40:08,007 --> 00:40:12,961
Rats don't make good soldiers in the legions of wolves.

603
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:15,086
Alright.

604
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:17,947
Forgive me.

605
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:27,218
Alright, I forgive you.

606
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,473
Should I go?

607
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:40,541
What's the hurry?

608
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,626
Come.

609
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:46,493
Come, let's sit here for a while.

610
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,884
C'mon!

611
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:52,134
Sit.

612
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:02,534
Forgive me, too.

613
00:41:02,534 --> 00:41:04,484
In my childhood,

614
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:06,721
Someone insulted me.

615
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:09,531
I beat him black and blue.

616
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,140
He asked forgiveness.

617
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,609
When Dad found out, he said, you should apologise to him too.

618
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,957
I was just as surprised as you are.

619
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,948
I said, 'But Dad, he insulted me'.

620
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,025
Dad said,

621
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:24,040
'He's asked forgiveness for what he'd done',

622
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,946
'You'd just as well ask forgiveness for what you've done'.

623
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:28,909
Tell me, now,

624
00:41:28,909 --> 00:41:32,386
Say that you forgive me.

625
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:35,003
I forgive.

626
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:39,531
There's one thing that's wrong with you.

627
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,872
It pleases you to see that someone fears you.

628
00:41:42,872 --> 00:41:44,445
No.

629
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,767
That's not right, mate.

630
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:49,548
Dad says that only the Lord has this right -

631
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,185
That man should fear Him,

632
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:53,919
And He be pleased with it.

633
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,592
When a man fears another,

634
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:58,872
It angers Him.

635
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:03,104
Fear His wrath.

636
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
