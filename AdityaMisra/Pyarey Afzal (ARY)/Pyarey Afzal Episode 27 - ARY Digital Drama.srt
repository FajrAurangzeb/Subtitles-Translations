1
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:13,709
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:18,906
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:24,065
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:30,407
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:35,952
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:40,593
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:17,200
What's up?

8
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,292
I'm watching a film.

9
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,863
Which one?

10
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,181
'Vaastav' ('The Reality').

11
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:24,869
'Vaastav' ('The Reality')?

12
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:25,933
Hey!

13
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:28,901
You'd said that it's one about hooligans.

14
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,957
Yuck! What a subject.

15
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:33,028
I'd heard so about it back then.

16
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,697
I'd not watched it.

17
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,201
Now that I'm watching,

18
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:38,151
I get a feeling it's a rather remarkable subject.

19
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:41,765
You're a rather remarkable subject too, Farah!

20
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,637
And I think Dad's right.

21
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,782
You should be married to a psychiatrist.

22
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,453
What?

23
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:52,042
An ordinary husband would commit suicide on the wedding night.

24
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:54,206
Shut up!

25
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,063
He's given you his heart.

26
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,286
Who?

27
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:02,375
The same.

28
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,672
Your psychiatrist.

29
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:07,886
The one you'd consulted to be cured.

30
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,984
Good joke.

31
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:11,687
It's no joke, Farah.

32
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:13,671
He's coming tonight.

33
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:17,920
He'd meet and talk to Dad, and take you along.

34
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,709
What?

35
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,312
I'd said too, when Dad asked me,

36
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:22,982
'Hmm'...

37
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:24,592
'Not a bad idea'.

38
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:26,250
Dad asked you?

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,301
He doesn't trust you one bit.

40
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,421
He said, 'I'd decide everything'

41
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:34,000
'And give her the news when the date of the marriage is fixed'.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,375
'Her' as in, 'me'?

43
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,405
Yes.

44
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,180
Where's Dad?

45
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,997
Sit tight, Farah.

46
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:44,036
To have a daughter is no farce,

47
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:45,788
So you'd rather not teach Dad

48
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:49,021
That he'd be punished repeatedly for the sin of being delighted to have two,

49
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,458
Nor mither him by telling him

50
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:56,692
That you've started liking 'Vaastav'.

51
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:08,717
He's coming tonight.

52
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:11,977
If Dad says yes, be a good daughter and say,

53
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:14,149
'As it pleases Dad'.

54
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:15,539
Lubna!

55
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,977
Lubna has outlived her usefulness.

56
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:21,461
When Dads start praying for their daughters' marriage,

57
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:26,986
Take it they stay awake for 4 hours and sleep for 2.

58
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:28,804
And this psychiatrist,

59
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,463
He's not a wastrel like Mehtab.

60
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:33,798
His reputation precedes him in the city.

61
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:35,399
He's got three clinics.

62
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:39,275
What else do you want?

63
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,420
That's the sticky limit!

64
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,745
Peace be upon you. I hope I'm on time.
-Peace be upon you.

65
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:09,005
Just in time, yes.

66
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:12,295
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace. May you live long.

67
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,385
Come, Monsieur le Docteur.

68
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,695
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

69
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:16,615
Sir,

70
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:21,515
Please don't address me as 'Monsieur le Docteur'; I get the feeling I'm visiting a chronic patient.

71
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:23,620
Come.
-Right.

72
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:27,369
Farah!

73
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,979
Farah, the chap's here!

74
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,837
I mean, the good man's here.

75
00:05:31,837 --> 00:05:33,649
Farah?

76
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,467
Where are you, Farah?

77
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:38,558
Hey!

78
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,317
You're so predictable.

79
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:06,494
I knew it,

80
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,613
You'd be here if not in your room!

81
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:11,410
He's here

82
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,880
And looking so handsome!

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,544
Just the thought of a psychiatrist

84
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,166
Gives me the chills!

85
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,136
I'm sure it gives him the chills, too,

86
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:24,254
Marrying one's patient is no trifle either.

87
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:28,855
But some people are just naturally a tad adventurous!

88
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,288
What be my orders?

89
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,368
Do I change

90
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:32,697
And go before him?

91
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,093
Should I say, 'Yes'?

92
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,984
But have Dad promise, then,

93
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:39,262
That he'd sleep for all 6 hours.

94
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:40,689
You agreed!

95
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,073
Wait, Lubna!

96
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,699
I'm not as predictable as you folks think I am.

97
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,720
That's it.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,216
That's why they're marrying you off to a psychiatrist!

99
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:55,879
Psychiatrists aren't spectacularly predictable either!

100
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:14,810
Your parents are in Yorkshire, aren't they?
-That's right.

101
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,621
When would they be coming?

102
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,309
In a week or so?

103
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,079
Did you send them a picture?

104
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,704
I did back then itself.

105
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:31,767
They just keep looking at it.

106
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,250
Maw was saying,

107
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,788
'However did you get such a bonnie lass'?

108
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:37,922
What did you say, then?

109
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,767
However did you get her?

110
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:46,580
I said, 'It's because I'm a psychiatrist'.

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,056
In the beginning, both of them

112
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:50,335
Were against my decision to become a psychiatrist.

113
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,280
'In Pakistan', says Dad,

114
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,269
'A psychiatrist is considered no more worthy than an aliéniste'.

115
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:56,818
Farah says the same!

116
00:07:56,818 --> 00:08:00,406
Except that she says it to my face.

117
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,201
May I come in?

118
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:03,092
Yes.

119
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,492
We're done talking.

120
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:07,195
She's...

121
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:12,241
Left her room and is sitting on the swing.

122
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:16,622
Would you allow me to meet her?

123
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,779
Sure, my dear. Go.

124
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,670
Where's the swing?

125
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,377
On the terrace.

126
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,984
It must be blustery up there.

127
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:25,737
Yes.

128
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,013
It is.

129
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:31,048
Fresh air, and a lot of it does the trick for such patients.

130
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:31,854
Now --

131
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:32,735
Look, my dear,

132
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,294
Don't even call her a patient by mistake.

133
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:36,394
I'm saying this before you,

134
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:39,673
I can't even think of saying this before her.

135
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:40,736
Shall we go up to the terrace?

136
00:08:40,736 --> 00:08:42,314
Sure.

137
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:45,176
Excuse me.

138
00:08:45,903 --> 00:08:47,464
Listen, my dear.

139
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,730
If she says something foul,

140
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,293
Don't get angry.

141
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,699
Psychiatrists never

142
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:55,983
Get angry,

143
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,452
Aunt.

144
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,589
May I come in?

145
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,053
Who is it?

146
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,193
Sibtain.

147
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,760
Sibtain who?

148
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,275
Your psychiatrist.

149
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,447
I mean, the one who's a psychiatrist by profession.

150
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,557
They've sent the blighter upstairs!

151
00:09:44,557 --> 00:09:45,392
Lubna!

152
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:48,717
She left me here and went.

153
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:51,134
Come.

154
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:12,828
You're the type to babble your heart out loud.

155
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,436
What do you mean?

156
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:18,790
I heard it hen you said 'blighter'.

157
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,787
Oops...

158
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,117
I -- I'm sorry...

159
00:10:21,117 --> 00:10:23,064
No, no -- It's okay.

160
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,514
It happens often in my profession.

161
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:26,302
Once,

162
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,434
In fact,

163
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:31,621
A patient abused my mother and my sister,

164
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:32,777
But I said,

165
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,324
'No problem'.

166
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:36,292
'It's okay'.

167
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,370
Accursed be such a profession!

168
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,935
Initially, my parents used to say the same.

169
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,320
But when they saw

170
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,427
The same patients, after being cured, bless my mother and sister from the depths of their hearts, they were happy with it, too.

171
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:49,758
You're still thinking of me as your patient?

172
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:51,630
No, no -- Not at all.

173
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,337
The thing is,

174
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:55,474
I spend so much time at my clinic

175
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:58,163
That it's become a habit, so to speak.

176
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:01,255
In fact, even when one of the mannies says something like a gowk,

177
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:03,063
I say,

178
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,568
'Mate',

179
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,386
'You look right like a patient'.

180
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:09,379
Why have you come up here?

181
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,482
I mean --

182
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,599
When Mum and Dad approve of this match,

183
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,614
Why this formality?

184
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:17,304
That's an intelligent question.

185
00:11:17,304 --> 00:11:18,943
Wait!

186
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:21,693
Answer her later.

187
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,796
The thing is,

188
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:27,487
There's no place to sit on the terrace except the swing, so I thought I'd give you this chair.

189
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,720
Thank you.

190
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,640
You're welcome.

191
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Please, carry on.

192
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,443
She is so sweet!

193
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:38,143
Then marry her, will you?

194
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:40,437
Why are you thinking about me?

195
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:41,612
The thing is,

196
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:44,099
Once you've thought about someone in love,

197
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:46,817
You've thought just about the one.
-Oh?

198
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,678
So psychiatrists love too?

199
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:49,427
Hey!

200
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,943
Why are you making a trifle of a psychiatrist?

201
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,024
We're the only ones who love genuinely.

202
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:56,492
The others just have affairs!

203
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:57,663
Ohh...

204
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:58,805
Oh, as in?

205
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,178
Pray tell,

206
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,716
I mean, when a girl says 'Ohh' to words of love,

207
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,421
What does it mean?

208
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:07,810
May I?

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,591
Please.

210
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:12,060
It means

211
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,935
'As it pleases Maw and Paw'.

212
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,496
Get up.

213
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:21,316
I said get up!

214
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,600
Come with me!

215
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:29,225
Look down there!

216
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,396
I can't look down.

217
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,162
I --

218
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:32,459
I have acrophobia.

219
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:33,989
I have acrophobia too!

220
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:35,770
But I'd rather jump from here and die

221
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,316
Than marry you!

222
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:56,654
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:56,654 --> 00:13:00,056
Perhaps my words hurt you too much.

224
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:03,310
But I can't help it.

225
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:13,365
It's okay.

226
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,973
Then go downstairs this instant,

227
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:16,533
And -- Say to Dad,

228
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,823
'I can't marry a girl so depraved as Farah'!

229
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:20,955
No.

230
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:23,659
Under no circumstance am I rejecting this marriage.

231
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,083
Why can't you?

232
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,887
It'd kill my parents' emotions.

233
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:31,740
With such difficulty, they've found a daughter-in-law who's liked by both the parties.

234
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,113
Both the parties?

235
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,074
My parents and I are two separate parties.

236
00:13:36,074 --> 00:13:40,096
Usually, it's that the girl they like is one I don't lik --
-And the one you like is one they don't.

237
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:40,879
Not at all.

238
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,300
Earlier, I had no interest in girls at all.

239
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,690
I thought of them as patients.

240
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,906
Every girl

241
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:51,286
Loves one and gets married off to another.

242
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:55,659
And the greatest irony is that they live life happily after marriage.

243
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,384
But this time,

244
00:13:57,384 --> 00:14:00,568
It's different.

245
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,511
I've found one

246
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,707
Who gets unhinged

247
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:08,303
At the very thought of a different lad.

248
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,027
It's

249
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:14,184
Time for me to go to my clinic; my patients would be waiting.

250
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,684
See you.

251
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:31,575
<i>If only one would look, begging for mercy,</i>

252
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:39,669
<i>If only one would look, begging for mercy,</i>

253
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:43,578
<i>If love is true,</i>

254
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,754
<i>If love is true,</i>

255
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:51,559
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

256
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:54,715
<i>If love is true,</i>

257
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:59,392
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

258
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,602
<i>If love is true,</i>

259
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:07,550
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

260
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:16,456
<i>If love is true,</i>

261
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:21,289
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

262
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:24,398
<i>If love is true,</i>

263
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:29,183
<i>It can make the mountains melt!</i>

264
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,931
It'll work if you come everyday for seven days.

265
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,184
I will, Father.

266
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:45,637
I'll come here all my life if it works for me.

267
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,901
Show such devotion to Him, too.

268
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,413
Offer your prayers,

269
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,979
Bow to Him.

270
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:56,449
Just so much would delight him.

271
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,370
I will, Father.

272
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:04,855
Wipe your tears, then.

273
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:07,402
One weeps and begs from Him,

274
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,683
And not begs and weeps.

275
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,761
Go.

276
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:11,901
Right, Afzal, matey,

277
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:15,310
The area from here to here is yours.

278
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,973
And the one from here to here,

279
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,428
Except this 10 kilometre stretch in-between,

280
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:22,824
The next 10 kilometre stretch is yours.

281
00:18:22,824 --> 00:18:27,350
Why have you left the 10 kilometre stretch in the middle?

282
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,960
That's my area, matey.

283
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,075
Oh...

284
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:32,895
And beyond that?

285
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,928
Beyond that reign the others.

286
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:40,849
Fanne Khan, Rehmat Baloch, Gullu Qainchi and the others.

287
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:43,834
By the way,

288
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,226
Najju,

289
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,865
How many murders have you committed?

290
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:49,008
16.

291
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,419
The one just now, though,

292
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,709
That lucky wretch escaped alive.

293
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:55,003
And how many out of these 16

294
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,520
Did you feel pity for, as you killed them?

295
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,753
There ain't room for pity in this profession, matey.

296
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:04,065
Alright; you must know how many of them were innocent?

297
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:07,924
4 of them were completely innocent.

298
00:19:10,305 --> 00:19:14,157
Why are you asking this, matey?

299
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:16,375
Just asking.

300
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,766
The thing is,

301
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:21,277
I think a tad differently.

302
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:22,406
I think

303
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,983
One should not kill the innocent.

304
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:27,531
In this profession, matey,

305
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:32,360
If you show so much as an ounce of pity, you'd regret it the next day.

306
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,453
There ain't a next day in our lives, Najju, matey!

307
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:37,864
To sleep is to die,

308
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:41,126
To wake up again is to live another day.

309
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:43,874
That's right, matey.

310
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,191
My father used to say

311
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:51,110
That an outlaw's life is only up to his thirties.

312
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,487
Either he no longer remains an outlaw after his thirties,

313
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:59,926
Or he no longer remains alive.

314
00:20:02,193 --> 00:20:04,911
It's two.

315
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,569
I'll get going, matey.

316
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,629
Bye.

317
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:12,629
Speaking of which, Najju, matey,

318
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:13,525
Yes, matey?

319
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:16,020
How old are you?

320
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,821
In or past your thirties?

321
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,723
Past, matey.

322
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:30,705
Say goodbye, then.

323
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:33,110
Goodbye.

324
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:07,539
Najju would've served us well.

325
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:09,902
So he would've, mate,

326
00:22:09,902 --> 00:22:12,573
But he only served his evil intentions.

327
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:13,620
And then,

328
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,557
He'd killed four people who were innocent.

329
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:19,534
Why are you distressed?

330
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:23,870
There is cause for me to be distressed.

331
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,133
I saw the map of the city today.

332
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:31,055
Not a corner of the city is under the Government's writ.

333
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:34,697
It's been cut up into pieces, a hoodlum reigning over each.

334
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:37,569
Another hoodlum takes over the moment one's reign ends.

335
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:39,539
This traffic signal

336
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,056
Is a traffic signal only for the public.

337
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,932
It's a border for the ruffians.

338
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:47,009
Kingdoms change from one signal to another,

339
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,695
As does the ruffian's name.

340
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:51,809
I can't talk to Dad,

341
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:55,944
Or I'd show him the map and tell him that the faithful are losing,

342
00:22:55,944 --> 00:23:00,288
And the sinners are reigning supreme.

343
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,595
I've ordered sleeping pills for you.

344
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:08,963
There's one by the jug of water in your room.

345
00:23:08,963 --> 00:23:11,307
5 mg?

346
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:15,220
5 mg.

347
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:27,412
I long to go to Hyderabad, mate.

348
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:31,016
I miss those alleys a lot

349
00:23:31,016 --> 00:23:33,287
That I, complete with trousers, shirt and tie,

350
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:39,083
With a lunch box from Arifa in my hands, would walk through on my way to the bus stop.

351
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:45,110
That kind of walking had its own kind of romance, Babloo.

352
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,506
Look, Afzal,

353
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,187
It's not too late yet.

354
00:23:48,187 --> 00:23:50,439
Hyderabad awaits you to this day.

355
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:54,304
Just decide on it and get out of here.

356
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:59,043
I can't get out of here even if I decided on it.

357
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:00,603
I feel

358
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:02,028
I'm here for this purpose.

359
00:24:02,028 --> 00:24:04,834
What purpose?

360
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:10,700
To murder those who kill 16 something.

361
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,480
I swear by God, until I'm past my thirties,

362
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,452
I'll hunt down and kill each of these buggers.

363
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,833
Farah?

364
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:48,476
I was yearning to meet you since last night,

365
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:50,834
So came here first thing in the morning.

366
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,224
Come in.

367
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,980
Mum and Dad are alright, aren't they?

368
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,867
Yes.

369
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,459
Molvi Uncle must be at home?

370
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:22,443
These days, he is at home.

371
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:24,709
Well, at least there's the satisfaction

372
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:25,976
That he's happy

373
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:29,757
Wherever he is.

374
00:26:30,818 --> 00:26:33,255
Come here.

375
00:26:33,255 --> 00:26:35,911
Let me greet Aunt first.

376
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:36,911
Mum!

377
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:40,506
Farah sends her greetings.

378
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:43,694
And upon you, peace.

379
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:51,896
There's nothing to be shocked, really.

380
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:55,712
Seeing Mum, one feels like solacing her...

381
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:57,122
But she says,

382
00:26:57,122 --> 00:26:58,538
'Beware'!

383
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:04,040
'Nobody shall comfort or solace me'!

384
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,405
How's Lubna?

385
00:27:08,405 --> 00:27:09,864
She keeps sorrow at an arm's length,

386
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,579
And is thus happy.

387
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:17,625
She doesn't even know that I've come here to meet you.

388
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,908
Got any wind about him, any news?

389
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:26,642
Got word from someone about what he's been doing?

390
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:30,349
One needn't listen or search for news about him.

391
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,549
One gets to see his photograph in one newspaper or another,

392
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:38,298
And with it, a chronicle of his craft.

393
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:39,488
Yesterday,

394
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:45,220
He's killed a hoodlum by the name of Najju.

395
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,257
Hey!

396
00:27:49,257 --> 00:27:52,020
You're affrighted!

397
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,047
Dad's affrighted, too.

398
00:27:57,047 --> 00:28:04,484
But he's affrighted that people would start fearing him.

399
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:06,296
Didn't I always say

400
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:09,342
That he'd end up in bad company if he went to Karachi?

401
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:12,249
That's what happened, innit?

402
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:14,246
Leave him.

403
00:28:14,246 --> 00:28:15,141
Tell me,

404
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,014
What'll you have?

405
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:17,811
Tea or coffee?

406
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:19,774
He may still be reformed, Arifa.

407
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,982
No...

408
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:25,643
It's no good reforming those who commit murders.

409
00:28:25,643 --> 00:28:30,576
They either go to jail, or to the gallows.

410
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:34,686
Dad closed his eyes tightly when he heard about his first murder.

411
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:38,138
Then, regaining control, he said,

412
00:28:38,138 --> 00:28:41,437
'We won't be getting him back, Arifa',

413
00:28:41,437 --> 00:28:45,940
'We'd only get the news about him one day'.

414
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,617
You didn't tell me -

415
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,898
Would you rather have tea or coffee?

416
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,868
How easily you say

417
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:57,337
Such fatal words!

418
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:59,869
I'm the sister of a fabled Bhai [= brother, hoodlum];

419
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:02,869
His fame resounds throughout Karachi.

420
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:07,866
Now, I'd say such things with fearless audacity.

421
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:14,693
Have some tea.

422
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:16,023
N -- No.

423
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:19,382
I won't be able to drink it.

424
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,826
Try and find the Farah who used to write him letters somehow.

425
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:35,146
She can stop him.

426
00:29:38,418 --> 00:29:41,052
You think I'm kidding?

427
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:42,778
No.

428
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,859
I'm saying it myself,

429
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:48,403
If I chance upon that lassie!

430
00:29:48,403 --> 00:29:50,699
What would you say to her if you chanced upon her?

431
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:51,951
What is there to say, really?

432
00:29:51,951 --> 00:29:53,952
I'd explain it to her and say, 'Go',

433
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:55,591
'You're better off marrying someone better'!

434
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:58,756
'Start a new life, you wee lassie'.

435
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:05,875
No heartfelt words can reach where he stands now.

436
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,992
How would her letters reach him?

437
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,543
And may God will that she'd have been married off when I next see her,

438
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:20,096
Going somewhere with her husband...

439
00:30:20,096 --> 00:30:26,736
I wouldn't be able to recognise her even if I did.

440
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:30,933
I'm getting married.

441
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:38,930
To whom?

442
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,714
Dad's

443
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,665
Found a psychiatrist.

444
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:44,659
He used to think I needed to see one,

445
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,268
So I went to him.

446
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:47,348
I found out

447
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:51,424
It was he who needed to see me.

448
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:55,940
Blessed be you.

449
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,159
At least show some of that delight.

450
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,459
If he's Dad's choice, he must be a good man.

451
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,662
Yes...

452
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,112
I've seen it, too.

453
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:11,862
You always end up choosing a dreadful one yourself.

454
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:15,986
When are you getting married?

455
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:17,705
I don't know.

456
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,346
Judging by Dad's intentions, though,

457
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,082
It won't be too long.

458
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:24,894
Don't invite Mum and Dad.

459
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:28,973
Call me and I'll come.

460
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:41,190
Shall I take my leave, then?

461
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,072
You'd come just to tell me about your marriage?

462
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:46,540
Yes.

463
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:55,160
This way.

464
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:59,438
Right, this way.

465
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:02,924
I'm leaving, Aunt.

466
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:07,003
She must have fallen asleep.

467
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:09,312
She takes a pill at night,

468
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:12,941
And dozes off in the morning.

469
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,212
I think that's right, what you said.

470
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:35,461
If you chance upon the Farah who wrote him letters,

471
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,523
Tell her to get married, too.

472
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:41,768
Settle with her husband and start a merry life.

473
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:46,010
He's not coming back.

474
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,536
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

475
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,411
Where's Afzal Bhai?
-Please, sit.

476
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,716
He's coming.

477
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:42,911
Tea or coffee?

478
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:44,802
Coffee.

479
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:56,973
Peace be upon you.

480
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:59,568
And upon you, peace.

481
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:01,902
How are you?

482
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:03,809
Fine.

483
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,449
Please, sit.

484
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:06,481
Thank you.

485
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,966
Thank you, Monsieur.

486
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:14,698
I've been supporting the police for two months,

487
00:34:14,698 --> 00:34:17,713
But I don't trust you.
-Look, Monsieur,

488
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:20,105
The police won't sign any agreement with you

489
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:23,537
To show their trust.

490
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:26,137
You've supported the police,

491
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:27,511
Which is why, in these two months,

492
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,061
Not one of the bobbies

493
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:31,188
Has so much as glanced his eye at you.

494
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:34,508
But I've not been told who gives me the money,

495
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:37,403
And why are my tantrums being borne up with?

496
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:40,197
You will never find out about the money,

497
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:43,542
But let me tell you why your tantrums are being borne up with.

498
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,792
The target it costs

499
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,761
The police

500
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:48,838
And the Government

501
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,876
Millions to get to,

502
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:54,230
And yet earns them the courts' barbs,

503
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:57,287
You get to that target in a few hundreds of thousands.

504
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:58,309
So actually,

505
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,113
Less is being spent,

506
00:35:00,113 --> 00:35:03,526
And more is being saved.

507
00:35:03,526 --> 00:35:05,463
So the Government is paying the money.

508
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:09,256
I'd said you'd never find out about that.

509
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:13,298
Alright, then, you'd have to answer my second question.

510
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:14,936
Ask away.

511
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,933
How long are you keeping me alive?

512
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:20,760
As long as you want to.

513
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,136
A lie.

514
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:24,684
If you won't enter politics,

515
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,526
At the end of the road, you'll be presented with two options.

516
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,698
And in the second option, you'll be asked

517
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:30,649
To take your money,

518
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:32,964
And leave the country.

519
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,151
And what will they ask of me in the first option?

520
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:39,884
They'll say, 'Say your prayers'.

521
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:44,754
I'm the son of Molvi Subhanallah.

522
00:35:44,754 --> 00:35:48,549
I routinely say my prayers.

523
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:41,726
What'll they do if I enter politics?

524
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:50,315
They won't even give you so much respite as to say your prayers.

525
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:54,270
The thing is, you're new in this trade,

526
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,426
And you're half a Molvi yourself, at that,

527
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,776
Thus, it'll take you a while to find out

528
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:02,836
That everyone's a hoodlum in politics.

529
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:08,700
Politics has changed greatly, Monsieur.

530
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:14,455
Politicians don't kill each other now;

531
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:17,893
They kill each other's henchmen.

532
00:37:17,893 --> 00:37:21,654
Although it makes the job easy for the police,

533
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:25,409
It doesn't benefit the Government.

534
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,424
If the riches of the Treasury

535
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,018
Fall into the hands of hoodlums,

536
00:37:30,018 --> 00:37:32,321
New hooligans are brought up

537
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,690
To snatch them back.

538
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,471
So, if one hooligan dies,

539
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:41,349
You get news that two have replaced him.

540
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,998
Do you take bribes?

541
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,982
One's got to, Monsieur.

542
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:52,707
Otherwise, for so much as sitting the wrong way on my chair,

543
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,192
Saluting a few moments late,

544
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:56,269
Or firing two additional bullets,

545
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,489
I could be inculpated.

546
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,548
But I swear, Monsieur,

547
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:05,717
I don't disgrace the uniform.

548
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,691
Have you brought the money?

549
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,787
Yes.

550
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,451
It's in the car.

551
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:13,423
Alright, I'll not ask for too much information.

552
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:16,186
But the next time you send me a dossier on a ruffian,

553
00:38:16,186 --> 00:38:22,625
Please do write in the footnote the name of the one who's been nurturing him.

554
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,312
I'm sorry, Afzal Bhai,

555
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:26,451
The other hoodlums are being nurtured

556
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:31,871
In much the same way someone's nurturing you.

557
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,761
Should you get furious,

558
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:39,714
This city will forever remain a hostage held by hooligans.

559
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:42,385
And should you refuse,

560
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:46,183
You'd be asked to say your prayers.

561
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:47,627
I know

562
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:51,762
That you routinely say your prayers.

563
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,263
But when they say, 'Say your prayers',

564
00:38:54,263 --> 00:39:00,919
It means you'll be saying your prayers for the last time.

565
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,718
Ask someone

566
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:06,067
To get the bag from the car.

567
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,851
We'll meet again.

568
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
