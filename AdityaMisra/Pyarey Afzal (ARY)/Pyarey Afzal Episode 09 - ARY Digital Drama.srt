1
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:13,446
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:23,897
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:30,247
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:35,716
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:40,465
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:12,746
Why are you taking me along?

8
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:15,046
You'd go and knock his door!

9
00:01:15,046 --> 00:01:16,296
Why me?

10
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,306
This.

11
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:19,446
This is how you knock a door.

12
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,446
And what if Molvi Sahab greets me?

13
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:22,466
What, then?

14
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:24,620
He'd hit me here with his shoe!

15
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,027
He'll say, 'There is no power but God's! What are you doing here, you gambler'?

16
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:30,936
So you gamble for real?

17
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,120
No!

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,576
I play matches.

19
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:36,066
Molvi Sahab thinks it's gambling.

20
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,576
There he is...

21
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,906
Look!

22
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:50,583
If we win the match,

23
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,461
I'll give you one grand!

24
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:54,019
One grand?

25
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,486
Turned tail at the sight of me, eh bugger?

26
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,593
I'm your friend!

27
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,063
You're no friend of mine.

28
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,643
You're a sworn enemy!

29
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:05,673
My reputation has been besmirched because of you!

30
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:06,643
Have some shame, bleedin' bugger!

31
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:09,533
I've earned you thousands --
-I have earned them!

32
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:12,125
Such 'earnings' repulse me now!

33
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:14,061
Alright -- One last time...

34
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:15,253
What?

35
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,689
A match with the old colony lads...

36
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:19,609
You bugger!

37
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,393
We're playing for 100,000.

38
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:22,469
So?

39
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,189
I'll give you 50.

40
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,819
That's five months' pay, you blighter!

41
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,629
It's about time Dad came

42
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:31,109
And I swear by you, he passes by this road everyday.

43
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,470
Just say yes and I'm leaving.

44
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,689
Have some shame.

45
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,520
Read the Qur'an.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,609
What do you think?

47
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:39,019
That I've not read it?

48
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,019
Go and read the commandment about gambling.

49
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,150
The ground beneath you will begin to tremble!

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,049
You --

51
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:45,721
Just pray that I win a big one.

52
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,809
I swear, I'll go on the pilgrimage.

53
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,819
Then listen to Dad's judgement too,

54
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,369
He said, 'Your friend Babloo is a sinner'!

55
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,740
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,540
You want that I lose the match!

57
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,609
I want that you win.

58
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,391
But just win the match.

59
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:02,549
A victory in gambling is your defeat.

60
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:05,051
Your Dad's bewitched you for sure.

61
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,941
You're betraying your friend!

62
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,291
One who supports gambling is no friend, Babloo.

63
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,372
Don't talk about loyalty to me.

64
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:40,116
What

65
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:43,411
Was this last line you said?

66
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:45,013
Dad --

67
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,183
Babloo was saying --

68
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,583
I heard the rest.

69
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:53,823
Repeat the last line.

70
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,096
Which one?

71
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,415
The one about loyalty.

72
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,194
I was saying --

73
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,943
'One who supports gambling is no friend'.

74
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,983
'Don't talk about loyalty to me'.

75
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,873
I will go straight to Hazrat Sahab's grave,

76
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:15,303
And tell him,

77
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,093
'My Afzal'

78
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:20,243
'Has become a great man'.

79
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:24,344
He'll be enlivened to hear this!

80
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,998
I've found out about that girl.

81
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,627
Who?

82
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:05,818
The one

83
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:08,667
Who writes letters to him.

84
00:05:09,113 --> 00:05:10,680
Who is she?

85
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,125
I won't tell you her name.

86
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,225
So where's the news for me?

87
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,615
I already know about the letters.

88
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,705
I don't know about the one who writes them.

89
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,345
What do I tell you, Mum!

90
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,705
It's all been going on sub rosa!

91
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,115
If love is blossoming between the two for real,

92
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:29,285
You could say a storm is brewing up!

93
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,035
Why?

94
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,255
Is she disreputable?

95
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:35,487
He is. Very disreputable.

96
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:38,066
Your 'most excellent one' [Afzal]!

97
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:40,768
Do you want to give me a heart attack?

98
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:41,968
No, Mum!

99
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:44,517
You'd be delighted to hear it.

100
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:46,699
I've had a heart attack.

101
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,780
Let me recover.

102
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,159
Then I'll talk to you.

103
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,254
What are you doing here?

104
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:32,798
Waiting for you to wake up.

105
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,848
Everything alright?

106
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:41,028
Mum said, 'Wait by her until she wakes up, and bring her along the moment she does'.

107
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,111
Reason being?

108
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,530
He called.

109
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,026
He?

110
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,146
Your Afzal.

111
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,511
He asked when he'd be meeting Dad.

112
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,037
Why is he so impatient?

113
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:03,928
It's just yesterday that he had a scorching fever!

114
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,037
The fever's worn off,

115
00:07:06,037 --> 00:07:09,987
And Mum's asked how he is countless times since the morning.

116
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,436
'I saw him sneeze myself'.

117
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:13,930
'He was shivering too'.

118
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,367
And so on...

119
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,810
Then, I told Mum

120
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,977
That he's ready to meet Dad.

121
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:22,186
Good Lord...

122
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,750
Well, it's all favourable to me so far...

123
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,846
It's happening exactly as I'd thought.

124
00:07:29,846 --> 00:07:32,656
And may what is unthought of never happen.

125
00:07:32,656 --> 00:07:34,826
And it's highly likely

126
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,916
That it'll come to be as I'm thinking it will.

127
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,359
What are you thinking?

128
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,812
Don't ask.

129
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:42,029
They say you should fear the possibility

130
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,416
Of something bad coming true when you say it.

131
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:49,485
Come now.

132
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,230
I'll wash my face and hands,

133
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,529
And then leave my room only then.

134
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,559
At least tell me.

135
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,199
Tell what?

136
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:57,919
What does he like?

137
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,400
Does he prefer meat or beef?

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,279
Or just fruits like you?

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,250
Mum's asked for two kinds of fish to be cooked.

140
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,859
But she said she'd prepare the lentils and vegetables only after asking you.

141
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,269
Is he coming today?

142
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,869
No.

143
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,610
He's not coming today.

144
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,749
But he'll come one of these days.

145
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:18,470
Then what is the meaning of this?

146
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,609
All these preparations?

147
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:23,200
The thing is, you'd vowed to offer a hundred additional prayers,

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,299
But you've been spared after a mere 12.

149
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,120
Your wish will be fulfilled.

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,061
The meeting with Dad has a ceremonial touch to it, sweetheart.

151
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:31,670
Then, it'll be Molvi Subhanallah

152
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,089
And Aunt Ruqaiyya's turn.

153
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,109
Oh God...

154
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:36,850
Thank God!

155
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,340
No one has been so successful in love before!

156
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:43,740
I'll say that the lentils be cooked in the finest clarified butter,

157
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,711
And any vegetable will do.

158
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,980
For God's sake, wait!

159
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,291
I can't wait.

160
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:53,623
Mum's grey cells are working at full efficiency!

161
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,136
And may what is unthought of never happen.

162
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:02,576
And it's highly likely

163
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:05,346
That it'll come to be as I'm thinking it will.

164
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,528
They say you should fear the possibility

165
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:12,466
Of something bad coming true when you say it.

166
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,796
Shall I say it for tomorrow?

167
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:16,766
Yes.

168
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,216
But if it rains tomorrow, he should come the day after.

169
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:22,463
Why would it rain tomorrow?

170
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:24,733
The poor lad gets a fever in the rains.

171
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,763
This is why I get worried.

172
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,333
Shall I invite him for dinner?

173
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,132
Yes, invite him for dinner.

174
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:33,483
But have him eat something before the meeting.

175
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:38,570
He'll not take a bite if something provoked his ire.

176
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,209
But why are you talking about all of this?

177
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,335
She's sleeping.

178
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,187
How much longer will she sleep?

179
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,747
She's vowed to wake up to good news.

180
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:52,209
This isn't new, Lubna.

181
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,009
Now, she vows to do something ever so often.

182
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,924
Have you watched Aina ('The Mirror')?

183
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,429
As in, the film?

184
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,259
The one starring Shabnam and Nadeem?

185
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes.

186
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,879
I've watched it thrice!

187
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,740
Your Dad cried while watching it.

188
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,679
The same story is going on here.

189
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,313
My Dad bears an uncanny resemblance to Shabnam's!

190
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,743
No way!

191
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:17,541
Your Dad is very soft-hearted.

192
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,840
Shall I tell her then?

193
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,490
Tell her what?

194
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,369
'Wake up, you're about to get good news'!

195
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:24,939
Hold it there.

196
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:29,120
There's a difference between weeping over a film and marrying off one's daughter.

197
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,016
It frightens me to think, Lubna,

198
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:36,710
The poor girl will have the previous night's leftovers for breakfast.

199
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,509
Anyway,

200
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,149
Leave it to God's will.

201
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,580
For now, go and tell her when he's coming.

202
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,720
Dad thinks I've become a great man

203
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,190
Because I refused Babloo's 50,000.

204
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:30,530
Because 25 years ago, his Hazrat Sahab had seated me in his lap and said,

205
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,011
'Subhanallah'!

206
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,201
'Your son will grow to become a great man one day'!

207
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,174
Very good, mate.

208
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:38,811
You've been scoring a third division all throughout.

209
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,177
But I...

210
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,181
I've not been able to make the grade in my BA four times.

211
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,011
That makes me a greater man.

212
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:48,820
I know I can never become a great man.

213
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,012
I couldn't be a puny clerk.

214
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,841
I lost the job I'd gotten thanks to Dad on the second day

215
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,100
And I lack the courage to tell Dad...

216
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,711
I leave everyday with this untruthful tie,

217
00:12:05,871 --> 00:12:08,322
And Dad is so delighted to see this...

218
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:09,212
Hey!

219
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:12,181
And where'd you get this cell phone from?

220
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:15,202
And where did yesterday's suit and boots come from?

221
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:19,312
Someone's asked me to feign love for four months.

222
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:22,272
She's purchased everything.

223
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:25,563
And she's paying me 200,000 every month for it.

224
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,762
You've hit the jackpot, you bugger!

225
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,593
He's selling out his conscience, you bugger!

226
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,613
To the Devil with conscience!

227
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,542
He'll be earning 800,000 in four months!

228
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,823
He can buy back the honour he sold.

229
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,253
What will you tell her?

230
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,478
Whom?

231
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:45,253
The one whose letters you read out to us.
-Leave it be, mate. Easy there.

232
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:47,344
This news ain't flashing on your TV screens.

233
00:12:47,344 --> 00:12:49,182
Keep it up, Afzal.

234
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,872
With 800,000 bucks,

235
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,357
Nobody will ask you

236
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:55,737
If your conscience is alive or dead.

237
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,710
I was thinking of the same.
-Splendid.

238
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,930
Think of it,

239
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,230
And work on it.

240
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:10,000
No.

241
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:14,146
I'm thinking I'd not take the money.

242
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,387
Are you touched in the head, bleeding bugger?

243
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:18,560
Who leaves the money that was agreed upon?

244
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,311
Who charges any money to love?

245
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,916
At least be happy now.

246
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,569
He's coming tomorrow to meet your father.

247
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:38,729
And your father will call to decline Mehtab today.

248
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:41,356
What does this mean?

249
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,176
Don't ask what it means.

250
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,426
I mean, are you going to accept him?

251
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,385
We will get to know after the meeting.

252
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,929
What are your intentions?

253
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:00,340
Last night, your father was watching an old film of Mithun's.

254
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,979
Which one?

255
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,623
'Pyar Jhukta Nahin' (Love Never Capitulates)

256
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,920
You're going to accept him?

257
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,731
You're unnerved as if

258
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,910
Your own intentions are changing.

259
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:15,505
N -- No!

260
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,784
I'm chuffed.

261
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,093
But --

262
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:21,550
You should be in a right mard.

263
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,980
Take some time --

264
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,689
Then agree to it.

265
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,130
At this rate, he'll think --

266
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,849
Farah was just helplessly waiting to be taken.

267
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:30,381
But you are helplessly waiting to be taken!

268
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:33,160
When word gets out in the neighbourhood,

269
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,379
The girl is left helplessly waiting to be taken, so to speak.

270
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,599
Alright, don't change your intentions now.

271
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:41,990
Let what is ordained by God happen.

272
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,269
Alright, tell me

273
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:47,099
Does Molvi Sahab know about this?

274
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:51,339
I don't know.

275
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:54,049
He will get to know today.

276
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:55,449
How?

277
00:14:55,726 --> 00:15:00,121
Your father said he'll offer his evening prayers there.

278
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:03,706
Dad will go to the Mosque to tell him?

279
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,726
Anything auspicious should start there.

280
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:08,226
For God's sake, Mum,

281
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:09,846
Why are you in such haste?

282
00:15:09,846 --> 00:15:11,516
This is but natural, my dear.

283
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,986
If the girl shows haste in falling in love,

284
00:15:13,986 --> 00:15:18,626
The parents show haste in getting her married off.

285
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,925
By the way, why are you getting worried?

286
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:24,591
He will agree to what you say.

287
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,520
Agree to what?

288
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,540
The same

289
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,800
About pursuing your MPhil in London.

290
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,660
In fact, he can go along.

291
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,330
He'll get to visit London too!

292
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,749
That's been decided already. Why don't you tell her, Farah?

293
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:40,115
He was delighted to hear that he's getting a chance to visit London!

294
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,240
There.

295
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,843
Don't tell this to your Dad!

296
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,660
Or else it'll be the first question when he meets him.

297
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,599
And if

298
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,969
He says, 'Alright',

299
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:52,936
'I'll get to visit London too'!

300
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,846
Then, God willing,

301
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:59,616
He won't have the chance to get you!

302
00:16:49,784 --> 00:17:13,509
[Prayer for blessings and goodness in times of calamity]

303
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,437
Afzal!

304
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:21,738
Why are you sitting here?

305
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,272
Come in.

306
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,421
Are you well?

307
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes. Never been better.

308
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:46,542
The fever's weakened you.

309
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:50,888
It's not weakness, Mum.

310
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:53,748
He's hiding something that he's ashamed of.

311
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:54,985
Tell me.

312
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,358
I'm right, am I not?

313
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,626
Hold it, Arifa!

314
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:04,699
Alright.

315
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:06,910
I'll hold it.

316
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,270
Tell me, now.

317
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,659
Should I get you some yahni

318
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:14,790
To cure the weakness, or chant an incantation for your depression?

319
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,449
Be ashamed of yourself if you are, Monsieur Afzal.

320
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,479
Spare yourself and tell the truth!

321
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,372
What's the worst that can happen?

322
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:23,660
Dad will curse you,

323
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,809
Mum will slap you.

324
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:27,259
I'd weep when I hear it.

325
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,290
But why should I weep again?

326
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,327
I've wept once already.

327
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:35,649
Say that you're not a clerk anymore.

328
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:42,859
To be precise, say that you're not even a clerk now.

329
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,010
Swear on my life if I'm lying.

330
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,869
Wager my head again if you like!

331
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,449
Say that she's mistaken!

332
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,310
She's just voicing unfounded suspicions!

333
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,369
Say something, my brother.

334
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,769
Or shall I have your Mum talk to your Mr Chengezi?

335
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:12,153
She'd believe it if he told her.

336
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,078
Forgive me

337
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:28,002
It occurred to me yesterday that I'd conceal it,

338
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:30,498
But I thought while praying in the afternoon

339
00:20:30,498 --> 00:20:32,898
If I started concealing truths about you from Mum and Dad,

340
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,608
It would make me no better than you!

341
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,778
A fibber!

342
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:41,528
And then, it occurred to me during my evening prayer

343
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:42,698
That you're not evil,

344
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:46,008
You're the most vile and dastardly, Afzal!

345
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,668
Listen to the truth now.

346
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:52,658
A girl named Rosy worked there.

347
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:56,968
He's been ousted for harassing her.

348
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,559
His leaving every morning, wearing his trousers and shirt, with a tie,

349
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,270
He just pretends before us that he's going to the office!

350
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:16,300
In reality, he's into something dodgy that's gotten him a mobile worth 40,000 in a mere 4 days!

351
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:19,477
Say it...

352
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:20,867
Please, say it

353
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,946
That she's just told a lie...

354
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:28,593
She just told the truth, Mum...

355
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:34,433
But the truth isn't like what she's said it --

356
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,990
You blighter!

357
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:35,146
You're right in saying I'm no longer a clerk,

358
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:38,706
But everything else is a lie.

359
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,666
I swear by you.

360
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,016
Believe everything you like,

361
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:53,317
But never believe that your brother could harass a girl,

362
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:59,302
Nor think that I'd do anything Dad would think of as sinful.

363
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:00,861
This phone

364
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:03,376
Someone's given me this.

365
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,245
I've also gotten a new suit and ties.

366
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,469
They've hired me for a job.

367
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,279
But it isn't a job,

368
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,607
It's a trial for me.

369
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:20,469
And to emerge triumphant in this trial,

370
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,201
I'm staging a spectacle with them.

371
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,610
It's supposed to take four months,

372
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,191
But I've got a feeling it'll only take four weeks.

373
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:30,721
I'll look for a job then.

374
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,830
I concealed it from Mum and Dad because they were very happy

375
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,270
And I didn't want to ruin their happiness.

376
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,710
Why didn't you tell me?

377
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,770
You were happy too!

378
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,958
I realised today that you can be more furious than Dad!

379
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:13,108
You could've asked for once before creating a scene!

380
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,428
Still, I'm not angry with you.

381
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:19,068
I'm pleased to see your fury.

382
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:23,259
You've blown me to bits.

383
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:28,461
And if you're embarrassed, don't let it show up on your face.

384
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:29,732
And your tears

385
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:32,904
Are like Miss Rosy's accusations.

386
00:24:34,335 --> 00:24:38,473
They can rattle my world.

387
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,490
What is it now?

388
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:58,190
Nothing at all.

389
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,999
What do you mean?

390
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:04,134
Everything I told you was a lie!

391
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,466
Just one bit was true, Mum.

392
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,826
He's left his job --

393
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:11,386
But you're under my oath, please don't tell Dad!

394
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:12,996
He's found another job.

395
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:15,077
He's working there.

396
00:26:27,526 --> 00:26:28,920
Peace be upon you, Dad.

397
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,117
And upon you, peace.

398
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:35,447
Everything alright, sire?

399
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:39,256
You came to answer the door today!

400
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,258
I wanted to meet you

401
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,029
Talk to you...

402
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:44,166
Peace be upon you, Dad.

403
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,109
And upon you, peace.

404
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,586
[Begin] in God's name.

405
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:50,356
What is it?

406
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:51,611
It's nothing really --

407
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,308
Just --

408
00:26:52,308 --> 00:26:54,447
Someone had bought him a new mobile, so he was saying,

409
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:55,906
'I'd ask permission of Dad'.

410
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,419
'I'll ask if I can keep it'.

411
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:02,580
Has it been purchased through rightful means?

412
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,525
100%.

413
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,629
You've brought it?

414
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,860
Yes.

415
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,167
Why are you asking me if you've brought it?

416
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,553
Now,

417
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:16,687
Don't ask me about these trifles.

418
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,297
Let the Molvi

419
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:20,778
Remain at the Mosque.

420
00:27:20,854 --> 00:27:23,330
Just don't do that

421
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:27,204
Which you would be ashamed to do.

422
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:30,244
Has someone gifted it?

423
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:32,185
Yes.

424
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:39,075
How say you give something in return too?

425
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:41,945
Who's gifted it?

426
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:45,766
Will you ask everything now?

427
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:49,376
'Let the Molvi remain'
-Alright.

428
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:59,520
Alright, now, tell me

429
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,059
How are you?

430
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,451
I'm fine, Dad.

431
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,840
Ah, yes...

432
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,910
Monseigneur

433
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:08,100
Showed up

434
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,349
Today.

435
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:12,538
After his evening prayers,

436
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:15,671
He stayed with me for quite some time.

437
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:16,643
We

438
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:19,311
Kept on talking about this world and the next.

439
00:28:19,311 --> 00:28:23,270
It seems he's very pleased with you.

440
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,449
'Someday', he said as he left,

441
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:30,239
'Come along with Madame to our place'.

442
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,954
What did you say, then?

443
00:28:32,954 --> 00:28:35,580
I said, 'Certainly, why not'?

444
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,340
There's one thing I like very much about him

445
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,169
He always sits at the back when offering his prayers.

446
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,370
People like him

447
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,183
Only believe in God's greatness

448
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,050
And not their own.

449
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,907
So will you pay him a visit?

450
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:56,361
Sure, if he asked with such mesmerising emphasis again!

451
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:57,428
Don't worry

452
00:28:57,428 --> 00:29:00,590
I'll call Lubna and ask her to stop her father.

453
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,209
Stop him from doing what?

454
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:05,200
Emphasising that Dad pay a visit!

455
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,690
Won't it all come out in the open if Dad went there?

456
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,724
Yes...

457
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:11,210
That's right...

458
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,421
Here's a surprise for you.

459
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,531
How many surprises have you in store for me?

460
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:19,441
This is the final one.

461
00:29:20,146 --> 00:29:21,446
Go on.

462
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:24,536
I've also found out about the girl who writes you letters.

463
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:26,066
Tell me who she is.

464
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,816
I know her name, address, and lineage

465
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:30,806
But I'll never tell you!

466
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:56,696
Hello --

467
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,446
Peace be upon you, Monseigneur.

468
00:29:58,446 --> 00:30:00,746
And upon you, peace.

469
00:30:00,836 --> 00:30:03,797
I'd been eagerly awaiting your call.

470
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:07,306
Indeed, it took me a while to decide on it.

471
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,797
The other day, Madame was talking about a decision too.

472
00:30:10,797 --> 00:30:13,767
I'm getting worried by the very mention of it.

473
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:17,206
I would like to humbly request something of you.

474
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:20,206
Please be courageous enough to listen.

475
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:22,173
Is everything alright?

476
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:23,994
The thing is,

477
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:26,373
Our plan for the marriage,

478
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:28,825
The date we'd fixed and all,

479
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:31,373
Is no longer possible.

480
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,440
Excuse me.

481
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,742
What's not possible?

482
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,609
Farah has rejected the proposal.

483
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:46,610
What?

484
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,469
What's the matter?

485
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:51,780
She wants to continue her education.

486
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,415
And she

487
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:57,250
Isn't quite accepting of Mehtab.

488
00:30:58,196 --> 00:30:59,786
Pardonne-moi, Monseigneur,

489
00:30:59,786 --> 00:31:01,960
She's lying.

490
00:31:02,939 --> 00:31:05,085
She's got an affair going on.

491
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:06,298
It's a very old one.

492
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,407
They used to exchange letters and talk over the phone for hours.

493
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:12,076
But Mehtab had even forgiven this.

494
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:14,298
He shouldn't have.

495
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:18,234
When the girl says so much herself,

496
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:21,163
A gentleman should behave like one.

497
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:22,866
What do you mean?

498
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:27,764
I mean, I beg forgiveness of you,

499
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:35,066
And I'm remorseful for not being able to fulfil the promise I'd made my friend.

500
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,743
Your friend's dead, Monseigneur,

501
00:31:36,743 --> 00:31:39,845
Only the living would feel any remorse.

502
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:41,456
Tell me

503
00:31:41,456 --> 00:31:43,763
What will I say to those whom I've given the good news?

504
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:45,573
What will I say to my family,

505
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,358
Before whom I'd said proudly,

506
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:50,273
'My daughter-in-law won't be from the family for I'll fulfil the late Esquire's promise'!

507
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,523
Tell them it didn't come to fruition.

508
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:56,403
The girl's family reneged on their promise.

509
00:31:56,403 --> 00:32:00,216
I, too, have to answer these questions, Madame.

510
00:32:00,216 --> 00:32:02,603
But I do not fear it.

511
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:07,183
My family's honour isn't dearer to me than my daughter's life.

512
00:32:07,183 --> 00:32:10,533
You're siding with her, Monseigneur; she's ensnared you in her sweet talk!

513
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:14,063
Stop the girl if she's taking a wrong step!

514
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:16,123
Don't back her!

515
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:17,463
Look, Madame,

516
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:20,243
Don't say what is improper.

517
00:32:20,243 --> 00:32:22,263
This decision grieves me too, but --

518
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:25,953
By the Lord, Monseigneur, think of how much it'd hurt Mehtab.

519
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:30,163
He'd vaunt his wife's qualities among his friends!

520
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,713
'How sweet she is', 'How good and chaste she is'!

521
00:32:32,713 --> 00:32:35,453
May I speak freely?

522
00:32:35,814 --> 00:32:38,113
This marriage is not possible.

523
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:39,474
La fin!

524
00:32:39,474 --> 00:32:41,374
How can you 'La fin' it like that, Monseigneur?

525
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,761
Is this a joke?

526
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,503
You'd fixed the date with us and you'd marry her off to someone else?

527
00:32:46,503 --> 00:32:47,962
What if something happened to Mehtab?

528
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:49,794
Nothing will happen to him,

529
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:51,733
He'll feel a bit of sorrow,

530
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,707
And then he'll heal.

531
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:55,934
It happens, Madame.

532
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:58,625
Kids' wishes do vacillate sometimes.

533
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,474
Don't say such things, Monseigneur.

534
00:33:00,474 --> 00:33:02,484
One should keep a close watch on daughters!

535
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:04,555
Leave my daughter,

536
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,765
And keep a watch on your son

537
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,704
So that he may not do something!

538
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:10,308
Goodbye.

539
00:33:10,308 --> 00:33:12,818
Listen, Monseigneur --

540
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,936
Farah?

541
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:36,196
You've not slept again?

542
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:39,477
You've been awake all night?

543
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:42,817
What is it this time?

544
00:33:45,346 --> 00:33:47,586
Are you alive?

545
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,871
Or are you dead?

546
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:51,121
Alright,

547
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:52,140
If you're dead,

548
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,301
Plummet right when I touch you.

549
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:55,880
And have no fear,

550
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,509
For the dead feel no pain.

551
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:04,420
May your enemies die! [ = 'What am I talking about'!]

552
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,400
Hello?

553
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:09,030
Where am I?

554
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,026
Platform #2,

555
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,216
And your train

556
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:15,156
Departs from Platform #1,

557
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,156
And, God willing, by the time you come to your senses,

558
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:19,656
Your train would've left.

559
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,301
Where are you going?

560
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,407
Have some shame, Farah Ibrahim!

561
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:27,757
There are things to do besides plotting and politics!

562
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:29,847
For instance, I go to the University to study,

563
00:34:29,847 --> 00:34:33,207
And I had to take a leave yesterday because of you!

564
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,480
You're going to the University?

565
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,036
Any doubts?

566
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:39,038
No doubts at all.

567
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:40,597
But I'd request you

568
00:34:40,597 --> 00:34:42,457
To not go today.

569
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,007
I'd made an excuse about how I could go alone yesterday,

570
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:46,380
But I'll go alone today!

571
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,656
Let go of my hand!

572
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:49,367
Please don't go...

573
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:52,516
You talk about pursuing your MPhil in London,

574
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,016
But is this how your studies go

575
00:34:54,016 --> 00:34:55,737
Skiving off twice a week?

576
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,876
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

577
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,772
If you went to the University,

578
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:01,480
Dad will scold you.

579
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,840
Oh...

580
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,189
Dad will be delighted

581
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,339
If you slouch about here,

582
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,689
And Dad will scold me

583
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,029
If I go to the University?

584
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:09,053
He'll say,

585
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:10,741
'Have some shame, my dear'.

586
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:14,370
'There are no classes on Sunday'.

587
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,846
It's Sunday?

588
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:22,436
Yes.

589
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:43,055
Where would you go today?

590
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:47,220
The cricket ground by the old colony.

591
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,079
I'll go and sit there.

592
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,069
I answer your phone from over there and have my lunch there.

593
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,589
Which reminds me, my lunch box --

594
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:57,900
I say, don't go today.

595
00:35:58,179 --> 00:35:59,730
Are you out of your mind?

596
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,187
You'd have Dad beat me with his boots!

597
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:03,410
You'd be beaten with boots

598
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,340
Even if you leave.

599
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,540
Leave it!

600
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,609
Dad will be delighted to see me.

601
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:11,693
Won't he be a bit worried

602
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:16,456
To find out that you're off to the office on a Sunday?

603
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:27,416
Take off your tie.

604
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,557
Dad's about to come out of his room.

605
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,041
Our complot shall end today!

606
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:43,310
He'll pay a visit tonight,

607
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,986
Have dinner with Dad,

608
00:36:44,986 --> 00:36:47,750
And Dad will say, after a solemn meeting,

609
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,916
'Alright, my son',

610
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,277
'You pass my trials'.

611
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,379
'Bring your parents now'.

612
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,556
That's it!

613
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,337
Our plot ends here,

614
00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:57,847
And the politics begins.

615
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:00,279
Have you ever thought what kind of politics this would be?

616
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,559
What do you think?

617
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,366
I've been awake for nights for sheer amusement?

618
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,636
I have thought it out.

619
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:06,506
Thought over every aspect of it.

620
00:37:06,506 --> 00:37:09,206
And I've come to the conclusion

621
00:37:09,206 --> 00:37:11,426
That Dad will accept him.

622
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:13,077
By the Lord, Farah,

623
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:14,886
Even the blind can see as much.

624
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,527
They can, certainly,

625
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,416
But they won't see.

626
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,503
Didn't get it?

627
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:22,878
Listen, then.

628
00:37:22,878 --> 00:37:25,366
He won't come to meet Dad in the first place.

629
00:37:25,366 --> 00:37:26,158
What?

630
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:27,348
Are you insane?

631
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,407
He's eager for this meeting.

632
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:31,748
To the dickens with him!

633
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:32,988
And Dad?

634
00:37:32,988 --> 00:37:34,487
What will you say to him?

635
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:36,408
He asked the moment he came back yesterday,

636
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:37,333
'Right, Irsa',

637
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,958
'So he's coming tomorrow, isn't he'?

638
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:42,498
To add to it, Mum's preparations --
-Will all go to waste.

639
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:44,968
So you'll call to stop him?

640
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:46,095
Is that it?

641
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:47,601
Yes!

642
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,942
Won't Dad ask?

643
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,354
Will he keep waiting for him at dinner?

644
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:53,378
Would you look at how intelligent you are!

645
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:55,658
It's taken me an entire night to think about this,

646
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:57,627
And you caught up in a moment!

647
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:58,898
Wow!

648
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,327
May I continue hence?

649
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:01,180
Continue!

650
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,830
I'd concede your greatness!

651
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,228
Good Lord, it's written all over you

652
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:08,331
That everyone will keep on waiting but he'll not come to dinner.

653
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,848
If he were supposed to come at 9 p.m.,

654
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:11,964
He'd switch off his phone at 8.30.

655
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:13,808
Dad will ask where he is,

656
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,247
Mum will be left staring at you,

657
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,737
And you'd hide your face out of embarrassment.

658
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:18,207
And when it's 10,

659
00:38:18,207 --> 00:38:19,883
You'd shed a few counterfeit tears,

660
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:21,501
And run upstairs with evident vexation!

661
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,587
Isn't it?

662
00:38:22,587 --> 00:38:23,517
Hey!

663
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:24,957
Exactly like this!

664
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:26,847
How do you come to know?

665
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:30,857
Because I watch films by your side.

666
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,227
I presume you'd not have thought of anything beyond this?

667
00:38:35,227 --> 00:38:36,630
What's the need to?

668
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,380
If he doesn't come, Dad will think,

669
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,360
'What an uncouth bounder'!

670
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,360
'He'll only make my daughter weep'.

671
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,529
Your film goes on nicely up to this scene;

672
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:48,390
The last thing everything afterwards will be is theatrical, and Dad will present it before you!

673
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,269
When I'm running the show,

674
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,520
Everything afterwards will happen as I like it!

675
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,160
Stay tuned,

676
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,960
I've got such a thrilling finale planned,

677
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,912
It'll make your head go round!

678
00:38:57,912 --> 00:38:59,969
You'd be left asking me for months,

679
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,109
'Tell me, Farah',

680
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,923
'How do you even come up with such things'?

681
00:39:10,586 --> 00:39:12,107
Call him.

682
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:17,696
