1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,644
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:18,910
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,980
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:30,452
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:35,964
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:40,669
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,055
Ruqaiyya?

8
00:01:21,055 --> 00:01:23,026
What happened?

9
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,070
What happened?

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,690
Nothing.

11
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,888
Nothing, really.

12
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:48,020
A bite is stuck in my throat.

13
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,590
When one's son is nowhere to be seen,

14
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,648
One can't digest the sorrow or the food, Molvi Sahab.

15
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,610
Nor can I, like you,

16
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,049
Defeat grief with sheer will.

17
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,224
Did you offer your prayers?

18
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:44,160
Did you offer your prayers?

19
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,450
Prayers?

20
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,255
It protects you from upheavals and wards off countless troubles, you blighter!

21
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:50,258
Get up!

22
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:51,470
Purify yourself right now,

23
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,003
And get yourselves on the prayer mat.

24
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,087
Why did you slap me?

25
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,950
Girls like you are only brought to their senses when slapped!

26
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,156
Offer your prayers, quick!

27
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,051
And pray for the well-being of those

28
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,597
Whom you meet,

29
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:04,980
Or call.

30
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,801
What?

31
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:09,712
While praying today,

32
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:12,094
My eyes teared up.

33
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,950
I didn't even realise I was weeping!

34
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,698
The angels would be laughing at you right now.

35
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,751
Bother about your own -

36
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,937
They listen either to the clinking of your anklets or the sweet melodies of 'I've tasted blood'!

37
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:25,815
The poor fellows would be sitting with their ears shut!

38
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:26,650
Get up!

39
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,792
Offer your prayers,

40
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:31,080
So that it relieves the angel on your left shoulder [scribe noting evil deeds].

41
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,644
I've heard that when your type finally sits on the prayer mat,

42
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:36,364
One can hope for an immediate relief!

43
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:38,543
I don't know why my heart's saying

44
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:42,128
That you're in need of urgent relief.

45
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,450
Are you getting up,

46
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,110
Or do you want another?

47
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,890
I am.

48
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,380
Wait.

49
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,946
Just for now,

50
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:53,505
Take off these anklets for a change.

51
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:57,889
You don't need this background music in orison!

52
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,312
You hag!

53
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,510
Both the bullets had hit him on the leg, right?

54
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,579
Right...

55
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,080
Then there's nothing to worry about.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,979
Right...

57
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,948
Why aren't the doctors coming out, then?

58
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:38,883
Why don't they say that everything's fine?

59
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,898
They're busy with the surgery, mun.

60
00:05:40,898 --> 00:05:41,965
Right...

61
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,707
He must be talking?

62
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:44,824
No...

63
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:46,091
How'd he talk?

64
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,746
They'd have given him shots to put him to sleep.

65
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:51,552
It'll take a few hours, now...

66
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:55,029
He'd only come to after that, right?
-Right...

67
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,641
Where were you?

68
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:07,000
I mean, where were you when the blighter had come to kill him?

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,047
You're at home all day,

70
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,676
But you'd gone for a good night's stroll tonight?

71
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,851
Sit down, everyone's watching...

72
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:14,210
What? What are they watching?

73
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,956
Look,

74
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:16,378
Don't change the topic.

75
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:18,554
Why don't you change the topic?

76
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:23,169
If you talk and ask about him again and again, they'd ask you who you are to him.

77
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:24,436
Hey!

78
00:06:24,436 --> 00:06:26,180
I'm his landlady, mun!

79
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,107
Hush!

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,372
Sit, now.

81
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:31,451
Enough! C'mon.

82
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:33,444
Sit down.

83
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,610
... Leaves an impression with his humility, my dear.
-Just mention her name and address.

84
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,020
I'll talk to Dad.
-Love Farah for four months --

85
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,260
What's this balderdash!
-Swear on my life if I'm lying.

86
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,630
Just keep on loving me,
-That's neat.

87
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,230
You're a right emotional man.
-She's just voicing unfounded suspicions!
-The move he's played

88
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,980
Is one I'll never forgive him for!
-What's your wife's name?
-My Afzal has become the best one [Afzal] today!

89
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,870
You've just gotten up, haven't you?
-But he's a first rate fraudster.
-Just a spot of lipstick's got you stunned!

90
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,130
Then why did you take us there?
-How say you tell me -

91
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,150
How does this lipstick look?
-Farah is the one who used to write you letters, right?

92
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,670
I'd kept you as an option.
-You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

93
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,820
Shoot the bugger!
-She's not the one who used to write letters to me, Mum.

94
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,430
The job as a security guard, you know...
-And you'd leave those who love you

95
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,810
In Hyderabad?
-'My Afzal'

96
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,610
'Has become a great man'.
-Spit in my face if I lose.

97
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,990
10,000 a month, and loving Farah Ibrahim!
-Just don't do that

98
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,270
Which you would be ashamed to do.
-Proposals will line up once Wali's out of the picture, you'll see!

99
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,220
He'd kill me if he got out! What are you waiting for? Shoot the bugger!

100
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,079
Afzal!

101
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,020
I've offered my prayers.

102
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,889
Now, beseech the Lord

103
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:48,053
That he be alright.

104
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,904
Who?

105
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,513
Do I have to tell you his name, now?

106
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,020
His name is etched in every breath of yours

107
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,386
And courses through your veins, Lubna.

108
00:09:58,386 --> 00:09:59,757
What happened to him?

109
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:00,822
There!

110
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,906
Now you know who it is!

111
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:04,433
Don't worry.

112
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,183
Nothing's happened to him.

113
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:07,942
I just thought

114
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:10,455
That may nothing happen to him.

115
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,411
I've prayed for many people,

116
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,377
But when his name came up, I thought

117
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:19,495
The most effective prayers for him would come from your heart.

118
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,930
What did you think?

119
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,786
And why did you think that may nothing happen to him?

120
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,285
Why are you on the rack?

121
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,436
Beseech the Lord if you've already offered you prayers

122
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:31,419
That

123
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,381
May the Lord will that he be fine.

124
00:10:33,381 --> 00:10:36,253
In fact, you should keep praying for him.

125
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,302
I said it

126
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,552
Because it just occurred to me,

127
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:39,050
'Alright',

128
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,010
'Offer your prayers',

129
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,262
'Beseech the Lord'.

130
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:44,146
You're hiding something from me, aren't you?

131
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,598
Good Lord!

132
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:47,978
It seems you'd tear up any moment!

133
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:50,660
Didn't I just say it's nothing, really?

134
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,383
Mum had said once,

135
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,403
'You offer prayers'

136
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,872
'And beseech the Lord'

137
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:58,086
'The moment you have the slightest of doubt'.

138
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,490
What is going on?

139
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,562
Nothing, really...

140
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:08,470
We're both scared, so, for a while,

141
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,580
We're avoiding each other's gaze.

142
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,221
Why are you scared?

143
00:12:14,221 --> 00:12:18,761
The 'most excellent one' [Afzal] in the eyes of the two of you,

144
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:24,910
That rapscallion has disappeared from our sights,

145
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,970
And her megrims give your mother's heart a painful plight.

146
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,850
If milk spills from the kettle when it's being boiled,

147
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,860
Or an eye blinks,

148
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,257
Or this wastrel, this heart beats a tad hard,

149
00:12:41,257 --> 00:12:43,047
She gets scared.

150
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:46,280
But you're scared too.

151
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,908
Out of respect, yes.

152
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:51,560
I've heard

153
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,710
'Ordinary people should be scared'

154
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,919
'When a mother gets scared'.

155
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,809
Alright, Ruqaiyya,

156
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:10,280
I've decided to sleep peacefully until dawn.

157
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,813
Stop telling your rosary,

158
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:17,824
And chant a hymn to get me sleepy.

159
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,720
He's alright now.

160
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,556
He's talking, isn't he?

161
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:37,840
He's unconscious right now, sir.

162
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,409
When he'd come to in the morning, he'd be talking, too.

163
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:42,430
Excuse me.

164
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,552
There! That's all it ever was. He's alright now.

165
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:46,941
Let's get going, then.

166
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,361
Going?

167
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,200
Call me if you need anything.

168
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,008
You'll get it.

169
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,230
C'mon, now.

170
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,220
Mam, how could we just leave like that? The poor man's just come to!

171
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,860
Just come!

172
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,268
Very bad, Mam! We should be staying here, how -- Mam, how could we just leave?
-Everyone's watching you!

173
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,421
Okay.

174
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:21,740
God be with ye.
-God be with ye.

175
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,719
Is Farah coming along?

176
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,524
No? Why would she?

177
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,606
But she's in the car!

178
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,470
<i>Every compeer</i>

179
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,310
Hey!
<i>Every compeer</i>

180
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,010
<i>Every compeer</i>

181
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,500
Hold on. She's sleeping.
<i>Every compeer</i>

182
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,670
But why didn't she tell us?
<i>Every compeer</i>

183
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,860
She's told us now, alright?
<i>Every compeer</i>

184
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,800
She's told us now, alright?
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

185
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,340
I'd say
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

186
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,420
Go and see if Lubna's awake; ask her to pack a few of her dresses in a bag.
<i>Every compeer abandoned me</i>

187
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,030
Go and see if Lubna's awake; ask her to pack a few of her dresses in a bag.
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

188
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,740
The bag's in the car already.
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

189
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,030
I'm not talking about my bag; I'm talking about Mlle Farah's.
<i>After ephemeral moments of companionship</i>

190
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,390
I'm not talking about my bag; I'm talking about Mlle Farah's.
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

191
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,800
I'm talking about Mlle Farah's bag, too.
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

192
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,590
It'd been kept before yours.
<i>Who has the leisure to stand by</i>

193
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,290
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

194
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay.
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

195
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,330
I'll get going, then.
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

196
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,500
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

197
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,120
<i>One so crazed in love</i>

198
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,340
<i>I found even my own shadow</i>

199
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:14,240
<i>Apathetic and blasé</i>

200
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,430
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

201
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,420
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

202
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,890
Where's Farah, Mum?
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

203
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,960
Isn't she going to the University?
<i>Who were those people</i>

204
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,420
No.
<i>Who were those people</i>

205
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,020
Why?
<i>Who were those people</i>

206
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,210
She's planning to use everything she'd studied
<i>Who won their love?</i>

207
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,120
As an incantation on Afzal today.
<i>Who won their love?</i>

208
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,110
She's headed for Karachi?

209
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,807
Yes, Karachi.

210
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,640
Mam!

211
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,530
Mam! Get up, the sun's come up!

212
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,891
It's been four hours since the sun came up.

213
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,441
Aren't we going?

214
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:42,293
Where?

215
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,990
To the hospital.

216
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,651
No.

217
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,090
Why, Mam?

218
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,880
We shouldn't even have come back!

219
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,090
He's taken bullets because he fought for me!

220
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,050
He'd be thinking, now that he would've come to,

221
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,520
'Where's Yasmin'?

222
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,290
And Yasmin's enjoying herself at home here!

223
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,939
As in, 'The ones for whom I'd sacrificed myself/Were but left purifying themselves'.

224
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,650
Goodness...

225
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,275
Breakfast, some healthy food,

226
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:16,999
That's what the doctor would've told him.

227
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,576
Who'd get him that, now?

228
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:19,950
Babu Hamid?

229
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,427
That blighter would get him papar [snack] with bread and some rotten lentils!

230
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:24,985
You'd say it yourself, then,

231
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,144
'They got the bullets out, but couldn't get the lentils out'.

232
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:27,916
C'mon, now,

233
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,028
Have something.

234
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,621
How could I have something?

235
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,774
Who feels hungry in sorrow?

236
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,803
Why are you in sorrow, Yasmin?

237
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:37,006
Hey!

238
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:39,064
Fear God, Mam!

239
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:42,071
One feels sorrow even when one's enemies are at the hospital.

240
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:43,654
Then, he's Afzal.

241
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:45,510
Our own tenant.

242
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,221
Right, you sympathise with your tenant,

243
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,184
But not feel sorrow like you do!

244
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:52,350
Besides, I've told Babu Hamid

245
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,130
To let us know if he needs anything.

246
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,628
I'll send it over

247
00:17:55,628 --> 00:17:57,030
The moment he asks for something!

248
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,704
I'd do my duty.

249
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,413
By sending it over?

250
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:05,992
As in,

251
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:09,499
You have no intentions to go to the hospital?

252
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:10,687
Won't you see,

253
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,383
Now that he's come to, how he is?

254
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,974
See if the poor lad's scared now,

255
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,948
And if he isn't, why isn't he?

256
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,940
He isn't scared, Yasmin.

257
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,340
I'm scared.

258
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,571
Right...

259
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,720
America's scared of a war between India and Pakistan.

260
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,230
But I know the American disposition very well!

261
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:31,040
They say they're afraid when they want to ruffle your feathers!

262
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,882
Talk about yourself, Yasmin,

263
00:18:32,882 --> 00:18:34,690
Let America remain on the other side of the pond.

264
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,423
Whatever's up with me?

265
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:37,334
It's not as if

266
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:40,748
I'm dying to go to the hospital.

267
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:41,860
It's just --

268
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,530
My heart felt that God's watching...

269
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,010
What'd he say if he saw such aloofness?

270
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,826
I'd just say that Mam had stopped me from going.

271
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,453
May I call?

272
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:05,778
I'll just ask if he's come to.

273
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,012
He would've.

274
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,637
Of course he would've, Mam, but I think I'd just ask to show the Lord, if nothing else!

275
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:14,644
Or He'd see you!

276
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,993
Call him.

277
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,756
What are you looking for, now?

278
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:23,748
My phone.

279
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:25,956
There it is, by the pillow!

280
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,197
Before your eyes, but out of your sights.

281
00:19:29,197 --> 00:19:32,978
Who knows where your gaze is fixed!

282
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,950
There's nothing to worry about.

283
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,348
Everything's okay.

284
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:52,601
Was I worrying?

285
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:53,760
No, sir,

286
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,137
You weren't worrying.

287
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,961
The people who'd come with you were worrying.

288
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,647
You're not going to eat anything solid before tomorrow evening.

289
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:01,342
Just milk

290
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,772
Or juice.

291
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:03,962
Alright?

292
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:04,790
Now, take care.

293
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,430
Thank you so much.

294
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,560
Why were you worried?

295
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,700
She was worried more than I was.

296
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,410
She couldn't think of anything else.

297
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,420
If anything happened to you,

298
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,580
Perhaps it would've killed her to hear.

299
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,060
Her Mam practically dragged her away, or the people here would've started asking her who she was to you.

300
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,770
Yasmin?

301
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,990
Yes.

302
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,250
Yasmin.

303
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,535
The police came here for your statement; I've told them to come in the evening.

304
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,019
Good.

305
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,622
Go back to Hyderabad as soon as you get better.

306
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,030
I'm honest, Afzal,

307
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,307
If you stay here,

308
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:12,338
And keep this enmity with Wali going on alive,

309
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,660
It'd be difficult to keep yourself going on alive.

310
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,890
If you want to live as Molvi Subhanallah's son,

311
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,820
There's no place for you in this city.

312
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,480
I can't go back now.

313
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,640
Send me back in a coffin when I die,

314
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,298
But I will never go to Hyderabad to live.

315
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,792
Has he come to?

316
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,250
I didn't ask.

317
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,537
Why?

318
00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:51,175
I didn't call.

319
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,260
You didn't call?

320
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,240
I thought

321
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,508
He'd not like it if I asked how he is over the phone.

322
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,120
How bad, Mam, innit,

323
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,750
He'd fought for me,

324
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,006
Taken the bullets because of me,

325
00:22:04,006 --> 00:22:05,980
And if I, now, just ask him how he is over the phone

326
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,130
And shoo him away,

327
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,944
Wouldn't it grieve his heart?

328
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,860
So?

329
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,046
What should we do?

330
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:15,853
We should go there,

331
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,710
Stay with him until he gets better.

332
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,910
Don't even think of that, Yasmin.

333
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,500
You won't go there.

334
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,493
Why, Mam?

335
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:24,884
Is there anything wrong with it?

336
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:25,904
Yes.

337
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:28,103
It's wrong for the wrong type.

338
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:30,770
It's better that he come to his senses;

339
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,230
It'll be real bad if you came to your senses

340
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,114
Once you got there.

341
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,640
Alright,

342
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,179
Will you have a paratha [bread] or a toast with your tea?

343
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,061
It's this building here.

344
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,178
Are you coming along?

345
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:45,485
Shouldn't I?

346
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:47,616
It'd be better if I go, though.

347
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:50,163
He'd come along the moment you ask him.

348
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,080
Alright, come.

349
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,656
C'mon.

350
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,461
Dad!

351
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,110
There he is!

352
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,700
Right...

353
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,874
My good man...

354
00:24:48,874 --> 00:24:51,253
Peace be upon you, sir.

355
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,105
What's your name?

356
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:58,740
Mehmood Ahmed, sir.

357
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,580
Mehmood Ahmed, is there any security guard with you around here by the name of Afzal?

358
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,510
There is, sir,

359
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,873
But he's not come today.

360
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:08,168
He's absent without leave.

361
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,337
Alright,

362
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,925
Tell me,

363
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:14,022
His address,

364
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:15,966
As in, where he lives?

365
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:17,650
Your name, sir?

366
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,992
Ibrahim.

367
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:21,014
Are you his family, sir?

368
00:25:21,014 --> 00:25:22,018
Yes.

369
00:25:22,018 --> 00:25:25,114
I'll ask and tell you, sir.

370
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:01,050
I've come to know he's come to,

371
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:06,125
And the doctor's checked and said he's alright.

372
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,027
Have something now, will you?

373
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:22,962
Don't be angry with me.

374
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:26,120
Just think, you, as a girl...

375
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,330
If you worry so much for any lad out there,

376
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,077
He'd think

377
00:26:31,077 --> 00:26:35,061
That you've fallen for him, right?

378
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,827
Tell me if you've fallen in love with him.

379
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:48,309
No?

380
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,976
Surely not, Mam!

381
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:52,228
I knew it, too.

382
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:53,960
I just asked you to be on the safe side

383
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:00,180
So that I can break the face of anyone who gives me a mouthful.

384
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,720
Good.

385
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,310
That's just what I'd expected from you.

386
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:11,360
Your insistence about going to the hospital got me all worked up.

387
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,651
But what was my fault?

388
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,430
Anyone seeing your condition would wonder

389
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:22,540
Why you're tormented more than the patient himself.

390
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,730
Should I get you something, now?

391
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,793
Just a cup of tea.

392
00:27:29,793 --> 00:27:31,599
Tea? Alright.

393
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,848
One's got to start at something.

394
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,668
This is not the first time I've taken a bullet.

395
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:09,751
I'd taken one in Hyderabad, too.

396
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,710
It struck me right here.

397
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,970
At my heart.

398
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,430
It ripped right through my heart.

399
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,850
That's why, to save myself, I'd come to Karachi.

400
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,540
How did you survive if the bullet struck your heart?

401
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,787
The miracles of nature, Babu Hamid...

402
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:29,026
I'd felt I'd not survive.

403
00:28:29,026 --> 00:28:30,182
Put a sock in it!

404
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:31,126
I don't believe that.

405
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,029
Believe it, mate.

406
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:35,270
You can believe that a bullet can kill,

407
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,736
But can't believe that I survived?

408
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:39,738
Have your milk.

409
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,980
When the bullet had ripped through my heart,

410
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,470
Do you know how my heart felt?

411
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:48,140
Just ask who had operated on me.

412
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,137
Who'd operated on you?

413
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:51,140
I had.

414
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,878
I put on each of the stitches myself.

415
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:59,110
I'd fixed it and made it a heart again,

416
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,110
But I feel that a heart that's been fixed isn't much solid.

417
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,705
It can only do so much as help one live on.

418
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,357
Do you have the slightest shame?

419
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:15,320
Farah, let's go --

420
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,850
Hey! Get off!

421
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,176
Let me see who's the boss!

422
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,792
Now that your engagement plan failed,

423
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:25,516
You stand in my way to get even?

424
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:27,660
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

425
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,590
Want to besmirch my reputation?

426
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,642
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son,

427
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:41,900
So I thought you'd not step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

428
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,425
You'd drown in shame,

429
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:48,567
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

430
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:51,980
The police are here to note your statement.

431
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,970
But you'd said they'd be coming in the evening?

432
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,765
It's almost evening, mun.

433
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,060
I'm looking for him...

434
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,360
I have his address.

435
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,730
I got it from his office.

436
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,650
Grab him by the ear and put him in the car if you find him.

437
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,680
That's what I've thought,

438
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,110
But I'm not sure he'd agree to get in the car.

439
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,480
Alright, disconnect.

440
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,770
If he agreed to come, I'd come back today.
-A -- Alright, talk to Lubna.

441
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,059
Give her the phone.

442
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,365
Peace be upon you, Dad.

443
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,069
And upon you, too!

444
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,881
Give him a slap if he tries to hold off.

445
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,319
Or have me talk to him.

446
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,511
What'd you do?

447
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:34,459
Dad, just let me talk to him, will you?

448
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,340
I'll give him such a scolding he'd calmly get in the car with you.

449
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,872
Alright, I'll have you talk to him if it's necessary.

450
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:43,710
Stop the car here.

451
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,980
Ask this man.

452
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,499
Alright, disconnect already, now.

453
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:49,741
Please give the phone to Farah.

454
00:30:49,741 --> 00:30:52,142
Here, talk to her.

455
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,226
Hello?
-Hello, Farah,

456
00:30:54,226 --> 00:30:55,496
You're so wicked!

457
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:57,990
You didn't even tell me that you're going to Karachi!

458
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,750
Hello?

459
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,934
Hello?

460
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,050
She's disconnected...

461
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,048
It got disconnected.

462
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:14,957
Just a minute, Mam.

463
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,296
Please, sit.

464
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,935
If I worry too much for him,

465
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:36,360
Who'd think I've fallen for him?

466
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,754
Everyone would,

467
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:42,710
Because people are rather undemocratic when it comes to love.

468
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,260
They'd weep for their own love,

469
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,090
But laugh at others when they weep.

470
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,900
Talk about yourself, Mam.

471
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,850
I don't fear people.

472
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,030
You've told me that there's nothing of the sort, right?

473
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,100
You're like other people, too, Mam,

474
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,670
You just referred to love as 'the sort'...

475
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,080
Tell me what I should say.

476
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,560
Say that Yasmin has fallen in love.

477
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,669
It's nothing 'of the sort'.

478
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,590
What it is, mun, is,

479
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,760
You're friends with Yasmin,

480
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,106
Which is why you're not intelligent like other Mams.

481
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,981
You don't even know when Yasmin's lying to you.

482
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,080
Step aside,

483
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,680
And pay attention to everything I'm saying -

484
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,270
Just like me, he's not intelligent either.

485
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,960
If I talk to him about you,

486
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,710
He asks, 'Are you talking about Yasmin'?

487
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,830
Ask what that means.

488
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,690
What does it mean?

489
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,440
It means he doesn't know, either, that Yasmin's lying.

490
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,036
How many of them were there?

491
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,258
Some

492
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:17,479
Eight or nine of them?

493
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:20,304
Eight or nine?

494
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,894
8-9.

495
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:22,868
What?

496
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,353
You were just saying 'eight or nine'.

497
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,910
Then, why are you asking 'eight or nine'?

498
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,170
Someone's shooting at me,

499
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,670
And I'd be there counting how many there were!

500
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,020
That's not how you talk to the good man!

501
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,621
Tell him this one, too,

502
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:40,520
'That's not how you talk to the good man'.

503
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,612
Go on.

504
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:43,409
Who shot you?

505
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:45,140
I'd ask them.

506
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,737
Whom?

507
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:48,690
As in, you'd look for

508
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,290
And ask those who'd come to kill you

509
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,990
Which of them had shot you?

510
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,326
Yes.

511
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:55,040
I know a few of them.

512
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,409
I'd get hold of them and ask who'd shot me.

513
00:33:58,409 --> 00:33:59,492
You'd ask them?

514
00:33:59,492 --> 00:34:01,139
As if you'd ask them!

515
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,877
I've told you not to talk to the good man like that.

516
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,830
Babu Hamid, take them away.

517
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,116
Teach them some manners before letting them in.

518
00:34:09,116 --> 00:34:11,957
Do you know who I am?

519
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:17,547
Once I'm discharged from the hospital, I'd tell you who I am.

520
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:19,920
Please, be kind enough to come later.

521
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,587
He's -- not well right now...

522
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:23,734
We have to get his statement now.

523
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:25,490
Once you get better,

524
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,537
I'll fix you up personally.

525
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,940
Babu Hamid, get them out of here.

526
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,230
Look at how you talk!

527
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm Sub-Inspector Rafaqat Ali.

528
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,589
If you ask them about me,

529
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:38,622
You'd tremble at everything they'd tell you!

530
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:42,670
Babu Hamid, please ask this mad bloke to leave.

531
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,717
Please --

532
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:45,620
Please come later, alright?

533
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,130
He's gotten angry now.

534
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,892
If you want to ask him something,

535
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:51,840
Please don't address him so roughly.

536
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,582
Alright.

537
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,190
Who'd shot Your Lordship?

538
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,310
I won't tell you his name.

539
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,420
It isn't proper

540
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,155
That he be in the lock-up while I'm at the hospital.

541
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,902
How would a complaint be registered, then?

542
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,723
Oh, shoot! To the Devil with the complaint.

543
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,901
I don't have the time for the police and legal affairs.

544
00:35:09,901 --> 00:35:11,870
My experience tells me

545
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,136
That this lad's intentions aren't right.

546
00:35:14,136 --> 00:35:16,299
Your experience is absolutely right.

547
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:21,233
I, too, have a feeling that my intentions aren't right.

548
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,690
I've decided

549
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,910
To shoot

550
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:35,627
The one who'd shot me.

551
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,650
How intelligent are you, Yasmin?

552
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,920
Tell me, will you?

553
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:27,000
Or do you just trust your heart and think you're very intelligent?

554
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,550
Do you feel bad to hear

555
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:31,041
That I've fallen in love with him?

556
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,220
No, my dear.

557
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,430
It doesn't feel bad to know that you've fallen in love with him,

558
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,500
But it feels bad to know

559
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,100
That you don't know the slightest

560
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,690
About the heart of the one you love.

561
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,580
You asked him and satisfied yourself

562
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,190
That there's no one in his life.

563
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,630
One doesn't ask about those who come into and leave one's life;

564
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,034
One asks if there's anyone in one's heart.

565
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,000
Does Afzal live here?

566
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
