1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,679
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,726
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:30,286
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:35,715
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:40,674
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,631
You're not sleeping, Molvi Sahab.

8
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:36,520
You're just pretending.

9
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,540
I took the pill too.

10
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:45,147
But I couldn't fall asleep.

11
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:50,444
You took the pill a tad late,

12
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,730
Which is why you'd

13
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,009
Fall asleep a tad late.

14
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:44,531
The deal's no more now.

15
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,096
I'd even asked him

16
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,516
Not to bring his parents here.

17
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,361
But I don't know why

18
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,408
He brought you here

19
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:56,361
Without telling me or asking me about it!

20
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,952
I know

21
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:06,945
A moment's daftness brought me here.

22
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:10,092
But I'd never thought I'd call you here and decline.

23
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:14,976
And I swear by God, I don't even know your Afzal well enough!

24
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,473
No.

25
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,751
I'm not being demure.

26
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:59,473
It is with regret that I have to say this,

27
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,825
But no such engagement will take place here

28
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,425
That you are so euphoric about.

29
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,174
It's all because of him!

30
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:16,170
He's a first rate fraudster.

31
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,130
The move he's played

32
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,048
Even after everything was decided

33
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,437
Is one I'll never forgive him for!

34
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,639
Forget getting engaged to him,

35
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,925
I don't even want to see his face!

36
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:39,987
There!

37
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:42,907
Your Afzal is here!

38
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:48,147
Go and welcome him, then.

39
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,772
I'm feeling sleepy.

40
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:56,307
People look good when they speak the truth.

41
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:59,043
But you're one

42
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:03,734
I feel affection for even as you lie.

43
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,370
Get some sleep, Molvi Sahab.

44
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,920
It's better for his health.

45
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:16,347
By the way, the lassie's still awake.

46
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:19,078
She'll take care of everything.

47
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:23,152
He'd be a bit drenched, that's all.

48
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,774
Take off your coat.

49
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,606
Take off your shoes.

50
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:23,312
Go to bed if you've had your dinner.

51
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:26,350
Otherwise, take something from the fridge.

52
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,594
Has Dad retired?

53
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,159
It's 1.30 a.m.

54
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,305
Do you think he'd be awake?

55
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:38,661
Just --

56
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,439
Check for once.

57
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,787
Why?

58
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:44,749
If I go to bed without talking to him,

59
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,527
Neither of us would be able to fall asleep.

60
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,534
Talk to me!

61
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:53,074
Relieve yourself of the burden of whatever truth or lie you want to tell!

62
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,223
I'll only talk to Dad.

63
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,276
Then hold it until the morning.

64
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:01,003
You'd be kicked out of the house if you say something that makes things worse.

65
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:03,384
Can you see the downpour outside?

66
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,054
Alright.

67
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,190
I'll sit here until daybreak.

68
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,877
Have you no shame?

69
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:18,944
Is not one imbroglio enough for you?

70
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:23,480
You have no idea how you've wracked our hearts!

71
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,403
I do.

72
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:29,440
Then stay quiet until Dad says something,

73
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,857
Else, you'd get killed for sure!

74
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,636
I've been killed already...

75
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,840
Will Dad kill me again?

76
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,327
He's fine now.

77
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:17,330
His blood pressure is normal again.

78
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:21,310
He's taken his medicines and is about to go to bed.

79
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,973
You'd better be normal again.

80
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:28,139
Over here, everyone has a rather weak memory.

81
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:30,443
We forget today's news by tomorrow.

82
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,695
Tomorrow, even Dad would have forgotten what happened today.

83
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,390
Did he mention me when saying anything?

84
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,973
He mentioned God and said something.

85
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,940
Perhaps he was praying?

86
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,690
He didn't even get angry with me?

87
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,727
Not at all.

88
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,621
Mum would be cursing me.

89
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:49,121
Not at all.

90
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,191
She was just concerned about Dad.

91
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,547
Then why wasn't I allowed to see Dad?

92
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:56,779
Because of Dad.

93
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,623
I've heard

94
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,778
He used to get scared by ghosts when he was young.

95
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,952
He's affrighted.

96
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:06,889
His blood pressure didn't shoot up today,

97
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:09,042
It plummeted.

98
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,883
The doctor said this happens only

99
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:15,316
When one is utterly shocked.

100
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,990
He was asking what had happened.

101
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,065
What could Mum say?

102
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:22,775
After all, she can't say that the father's afraid of his daughter!

103
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,080
Stop it, Lubna.

104
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,457
Don't show yourself before Dad for a few days.

105
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,173
Why not?

106
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:45,147
Dad's going through a memory loss.

107
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:48,705
His memory may come back at the sight of you.

108
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,715
Okay?

109
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,750
Good night.

110
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,710
Wait, Lubna.

111
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,304
I can't wait.

112
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,958
Mum's said it firmly,

113
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,958
'Whoever stays with Farah shall be held responsible for his own words and deeds'!

114
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:58,035
Sit down.

115
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,451
Sit.

116
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:07,533
Orders,

117
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,497
Sir?

118
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,767
Please ask Arifa

119
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,940
To go to her room.

120
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:22,108
Go, my dear.

121
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,752
He's getting embarrassed in your presence.

122
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
What are your orders for your Mum?

123
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,940
She's eager to come here too.

124
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:48,434
There's nothing to conceal from Mum.

125
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:52,123
I just feel embarrassed before my sister.

126
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,236
Come here, Ruqaiyya!

127
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:57,103
You've been granted permission!

128
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:12,811
So it's been decided that he'd sit and talk,

129
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,809
And we'd listen.

130
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:20,132
Holding back would make no difference,

131
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,952
And if necessary, we'd speak too.

132
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,243
Isn't it

133
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,588
My dear,

134
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:26,965
May we

135
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,555
Speak sometimes, too, or

136
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,542
Is it that only you'd speak

137
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:34,131
And we'd listen?

138
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:40,507
I know I've wronged both of you.

139
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,620
It would've been more proper that you'd speak

140
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,458
And I'd listen.

141
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,744
But please -- listen to just one thing I have to say.

142
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,879
And say everything that you want to.

143
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,899
Go on.

144
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:57,752
I confess

145
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:01,962
That I'd known she'd refuse in front of everyone.

146
00:14:02,762 --> 00:14:06,045
Regardless, I took you there.

147
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,304
Splendid, my son.

148
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:11,153
We're delighted to know you'd drag us

149
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:14,150
To drown where the waters are deep.

150
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,433
I've drowned too, Mum.

151
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:21,230
This is why I'm saying to you

152
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,258
That I want to come ashore.

153
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,867
Alright.

154
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,116
Continue.

155
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:35,114
I wanted the answer to a question.

156
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:40,105
Do I have the right to love a girl

157
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:44,340
Who doesn't even know me well?

158
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,585
Who, then, is the one who writes you letters?

159
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,486
Forget the one who writes letters, Dad.

160
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:57,308
Please, answer my question.

161
00:14:57,308 --> 00:14:59,783
Hear the answer from me:

162
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:04,000
The perfidious have no right to fancy anyone here or there.

163
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,671
You've transgressed every limit of shame and morality.

164
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:11,444
I'm Molvi Subhanallah's son, Mum.

165
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,880
I can neither go back on my word, nor two-time anyone.

166
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,630
I'd just request you

167
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:22,866
To allow me to get my answer from Dad.

168
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:30,147
I think that to love such a girl is not comme il faut.

169
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:31,551
This

170
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:36,741
Would be like trespassing on her modesty.

171
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,583
What kind of a trespass, Dad?

172
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:44,044
Neither have I said anything to her nor asserted my right to love her.

173
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:47,118
Then why did you take us there?

174
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:50,584
Why do you go to the Mosque?

175
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,021
Do you go there out of love for Him,

176
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,940
Or do your job for the neighbourhood?

177
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,717
Oh God!

178
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:02,243
This blighter's become a blasphemer!
-Shut up, Ruqaiyya!

179
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:05,181
Let me talk.

180
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,824
No, my son.

181
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,452
I don't do a job.

182
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,344
I love Him.

183
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:15,824
Have you ever talked to Him?

184
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:20,580
Have you ever met Him?
-If only one person alone were dear to Him, one would meet...

185
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,670
And then,

186
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,973
He asks us to love Him.

187
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,341
And what if one does not?

188
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:29,469
He loves him regardless, doesn't he?

189
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:34,927
There are thousands in the world who neither believe in nor love Him.

190
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,872
Does He not love them all, regardless?

191
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,407
So?

192
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,781
I've started down God's path, Dad.

193
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:51,135
I will keep on loving

194
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,508
Whether she does or not.

195
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:55,598
Go on, my good man.

196
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,157
Keep on loving.

197
00:16:58,596 --> 00:17:02,943
Let me know what I can do for you.

198
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,774
Allow me --

199
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,300
Allow as in,

200
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,994
Give it in writing that such invisible love of yours for any girl

201
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,753
Is justified?

202
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,647
Not at all.

203
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:19,894
I'm leaving Hyderabad.

204
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,870
Where to?

205
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,740
Karachi.

206
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:38,175
Has your spiritual guide asked that you should

207
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:42,976
Start this sermon of love there?

208
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,671
I'm going to try out my luck, Dad.

209
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:48,422
Then try your luck, my dear,

210
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,736
Don't try our endurance.

211
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,733
Set for us only such little trials as this,

212
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:58,688
And take us along to a girl's house,

213
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,975
We'd go with you,

214
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,990
Hear a refusal,

215
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,960
Come back,

216
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,911
And fall asleep after taking sleeping pills.

217
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:13,693
Today, too, we have taken sleeping pills.

218
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,345
But the two of us couldn't sleep.

219
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,345
Do you know why?

220
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,578
You'd not come home.

221
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:23,066
Now that you're here,

222
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:24,473
You'll see

223
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:27,819
How well the pill works!

224
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:32,403
Get up, Ruqaiyya.

225
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:37,948
Before he talks about parting again,

226
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:41,216
And wracks my heart with grief,

227
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,403
We should better leave.

228
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,620
I'm leaving, Dad.

229
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,740
You blighter!

230
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:56,494
You'd leave Hyderabad for the one who doesn't love you,

231
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,458
And you'd leave those who love you

232
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,484
In Hyderabad?

233
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:04,723
This habit of yours isn't good, Ruqaiyya.

234
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,930
You whack him the moment

235
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,395
Something rubs you the wrong way.

236
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:16,835
I had a few opportunities like this, too,

237
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:20,413
But I did not raise my hand.

238
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:23,252
And

239
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:27,471
What good is striking him, Ruqaiyya Begum,

240
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:32,991
Who'd strike a fatal blow to us with his separation?

241
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,897
Come.

242
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,936
Get some sleep.

243
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:41,082
Otherwise,

244
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,675
It'll prove the chemist wrong.

245
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:45,925
He was saying

246
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,959
The pill would

247
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:51,399
Get you drowsy within 15 minutes.

248
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,237
Come.

249
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,941
Are you going barmy?

250
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,506
You humiliate and give sorrow,

251
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,338
And shatter hearts,

252
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:32,225
And then stay awake?

253
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,584
I'm going to the University.

254
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,294
You have five minutes if you want to come.

255
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:39,039
Get your bag and come with me.

256
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:43,337
Give me the five minutes

257
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:45,736
That you have.

258
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:47,731
What do you mean?

259
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,562
Sit by me.

260
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,719
Here.

261
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:02,051
I did what was right, didn't I?

262
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,599
Yes, you did exactly what was right,

263
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,607
How dare he bring his parents here,

264
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:10,133
And think you'd get engaged to him?

265
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,506
Then why is Dad furious?

266
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:15,554
And why is Mum not talking to me?

267
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,607
It's hit them a bit hard.

268
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,115
They got to know the real story

269
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:22,266
When the engagement got cancelled.

270
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:24,216
You're telling the truth, aren't you?

271
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,170
I swear by you, I am.

272
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,252
Initially, I was a bit angry with you,

273
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,861
Then, I thought over it and felt

274
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:32,442
That that's what you should've done.

275
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,528
He shocked us all.

276
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:36,095
When we'd clearly stopped him,

277
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,503
Told him not to come,

278
00:21:37,503 --> 00:21:39,442
He showed up regardless!

279
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:42,699
And why did he bring his parents and Arifa along?

280
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:44,248
The blighter would've thought

281
00:21:44,248 --> 00:21:46,519
'The girl's parents have agreed'.

282
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,500
'How about attempting an engagement'?

283
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,105
And you thought all along he'd be virtuous and irreproachable, being a Molvi's son.

284
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:52,968
Well,

285
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:55,294
His previous reputation wasn't exactly good either.

286
00:21:55,294 --> 00:21:56,446
I still thought

287
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:58,602
He's been ousted from his job and in need of one,

288
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:00,255
And he's Arifa's brother,

289
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,328
So,

290
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:04,496
He'd earn some being of help to us.

291
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,143
I will give him his money anyhow.

292
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:09,484
In all honesty, I'd shove it in his face!

293
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,197
But, Lubna,

294
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:13,090
I pity that girl

295
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,430
With whom he's got an exchange of letters going on.

296
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,854
The poor lass.

297
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:20,525
Her heart would be struck with woe if she found out!

298
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:22,057
If I ever came across her,

299
00:22:22,057 --> 00:22:25,486
I'd narrate each of Monsieur Afzal's glorious adventures!

300
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:27,257
Girls are raving mad.

301
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:29,854
Look at the kind they fall for!

302
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:31,522
By the way,

303
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,936
Why haven't you slept all night?

304
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,286
I was delighted!

305
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,216
Even more so because I didn't do anything stupid this time!

306
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,836
Finished him off in a flash!

307
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:42,354
Let's go to the University, then, shall we?

308
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:43,618
Why are you sitting?

309
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:44,646
Get in the car.

310
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,976
I'm coming in two minutes!

311
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,620
God forgive, Molvi Sahab,

312
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,828
Last night's sleeping pill struck more like a pellet.

313
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:47,249
You even missed your morning prayers!

314
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:52,376
Why do tough times always make you miss your morning prayers?

315
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,829
Go and give it to him.

316
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:57,221
Give the blighter whatever he wants in his room.

317
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:59,783
I'd rather not glimpse him.

318
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,563
What was I saying?

319
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:11,467
You were talking about missing my morning prayers.

320
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:12,679
Right,

321
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,645
What am I remembering!

322
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:16,728
Her name was 'Fajr' [daybreak] too, wasn't it?

323
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:19,053
Your aunt's daughter.

324
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:21,402
You also 'missed' her!

325
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:23,114
Yes.

326
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,930
If I see her somewhere,

327
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,099
She calls me 'brother'.

328
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,388
What else can she do now?

329
00:24:29,388 --> 00:24:32,172
And what else can you do now?

330
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,817
When the 'daybreak' is your beloved,

331
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:37,355
You don't compensate for 'missing' it!

332
00:24:37,915 --> 00:24:39,920
Don't take refuge behind your son

333
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,321
And cast these aspersions on me, Ruqaiyya Begum!

334
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:47,464
The son no longer has a place in my heart, Molvi Sahab.

335
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:50,418
I've locked all motherly affection in a casket.

336
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:51,461
Didn't you see

337
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:54,889
How I didn't even call him for breakfast?

338
00:24:57,268 --> 00:25:00,417
He must be saying, 'I'll have breakfast with Dad'.

339
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,063
Make it clear to him:

340
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:04,199
'You shall not have such good fortune'.

341
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:07,285
He's not in his room, Mum.

342
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:12,974
Where's he gone?

343
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,116
No idea.

344
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:16,902
It kills me to hear this!

345
00:25:16,902 --> 00:25:18,638
He's left, Molvi Sahab!

346
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:21,046
Molvi Sahab, he's left us!

347
00:25:21,046 --> 00:25:23,073
The blighter has taken after his father!

348
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:25,278
He does exactly as he says!

349
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:26,870
What are you looking at, sitting like this?

350
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:27,373
Go!

351
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:29,059
Bring him back, Molvi Sahab,

352
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,156
Bring him back!

353
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:32,516
Or else I'm gone.

354
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,930
Get a grip on yourself, Ruqaiyya.

355
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,661
He's not going anywhere.

356
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,925
Call him.

357
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:45,105
You can have me promise it, Molvi Sahab.

358
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:48,070
I won't slap him.

359
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,477
Would you look at that, Lubna!

360
00:26:17,477 --> 00:26:20,788
He's standing in the way smoking cigarettes!

361
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,717
Know what, he'd be smoking cigarettes standing in the way like this everyday!

362
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,587
You don't know me, then.

363
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,267
If I saw him again,

364
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:32,139
You'll see what I make of him!

365
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,096
Hello?

366
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:49,396
Yes, where are you?

367
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:51,204
You're here, aren't you?

368
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:52,954
In Hyderabad?

369
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:54,160
Yes, Mum,

370
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,463
I'm here.

371
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:56,842
I'm with Timmy

372
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:59,416
Going to apply for a job.

373
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,801
Why didn't you have your breakfast, then?

374
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:05,826
I will have my breakfast.

375
00:27:05,931 --> 00:27:08,406
When your anger wanes,

376
00:27:08,406 --> 00:27:10,323
I'll have breakfast with Dad.

377
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:12,009
There!

378
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,194
Has your Dad forbidden you?

379
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:16,589
You have forbidden me.

380
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,698
I'd heard it.

381
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:20,187
Alright,

382
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:21,901
Now don't blabber on like that.

383
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:22,843
Disconnect now,

384
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:23,883
Come back quickly,

385
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:27,135
And have your lunch with Dad.

386
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,910
Yes, Mum.

387
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,910
The blighter's here

388
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,900
Stravaiging about with his dosser friends.

389
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:01,972
Right, now, what do you want to do?

390
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:03,461
Mate,

391
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:06,603
I want to become a great man.

392
00:28:07,356 --> 00:28:10,216
You think I can make you a great man?

393
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:11,343
You bugger!

394
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,138
What are you talking about and with whom!

395
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm honest, Timmy.

396
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:18,914
There's one way, mate.

397
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,783
Tell your Oul Fella and have your name changed

398
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:22,456
To 'Great Man'.

399
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:25,221
Sajid and I will have the entire neighbourhood remember it.

400
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:26,831
Everyone would say at your very sight,

401
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,738
'Great Man' is coming.

402
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,542
I'm talking about a real great man.

403
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,104
At the sight of whom, you'd say,

404
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:41,628
'That's Afzal',

405
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:43,748
And the people say, 'Behold'!

406
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:46,285
'He's a great man'!

407
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:58,539
Won't you go to the office today?

408
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:02,001
I won't for a few more days.

409
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,356
I'd called to ask.

410
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:06,858
Everything's going on fine.

411
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:12,269
It's better that you talk to her and ask her

412
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:16,661
Why she did this instead of suffering quietly like this.

413
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:19,463
I understand her problem.

414
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:22,373
She'd have an answer.

415
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,886
Then what's your problem?

416
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:31,690
Think about how much it would pain me to see you on the rack like this!

417
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:35,497
Honestly, Irsa,

418
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,642
Has such a moment ever befallen me that you felt

419
00:29:39,642 --> 00:29:42,238
I cannot look someone in the eye and talk straight?

420
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,942
Never?

421
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:46,211
But why do I feel that

422
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:50,050
I wouldn't be able to meet his gaze if he ever showed up before me?

423
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,842
Why does my heart say that he's a virtuous man,

424
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,255
He is nothing in his status,

425
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:00,823
But he has the modest and honourable character of a gentleman.

426
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:03,253
If he's thought about Farah,

427
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:05,856
He's thought only about Farah.

428
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:09,701
Not for once has he thought about my mill or bank balance.

429
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,391
He's one of them, Irsa,

430
00:30:12,391 --> 00:30:18,360
Who'd sell their hide to earn enough to feed their wife.

431
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:21,188
My father used to say

432
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:24,868
That to find a gentleman from among men

433
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:28,009
Is like finding from a heap of watermelons one

434
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,392
That's red on the inside.

435
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:18,554
Have some more.

436
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:30,448
Hey!

437
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:31,159
Leave that be.

438
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:31,962
Here.

439
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:33,912
Have a warm one.

440
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,799
That's enough. I won't have so much.

441
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,299
Why not?

442
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:41,512
You'll get a fever from the rains if you stay griefstricken like this!

443
00:33:41,512 --> 00:33:42,596
Eat as much as you like.

444
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:44,950
Show, by eating, that you don't care the slightest

445
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,051
About one who doesn't care about you!

446
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:48,937
Get a grip on your grief.

447
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:50,684
Don't fear it.

448
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:53,173
What are you talking about?

449
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,761
I'm saying big words, isn't it?

450
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:58,618
Yes...

451
00:33:59,113 --> 00:34:00,352
Do you know

452
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:04,241
What one wants to achieve by giving someone sorrow?

453
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,840
Ask what one wants!

454
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,499
What?

455
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,985
One wants you to be tormented,

456
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:13,099
Weep,

457
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,877
Wail and tell that you can't take so much grief.

458
00:34:17,877 --> 00:34:21,293
But you are Molvi Subhanallah's son.

459
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:22,871
Neither will you be tormented,

460
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:24,122
Nor weep,

461
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:28,727
Nor wail to show anyone your grief.

462
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:31,092
Promise me.

463
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:35,125
Promise me, won't you?

464
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,553
I can't promise you.

465
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:43,532
The thing is

466
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:48,001
I don't quite come up to your expectations.

467
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:52,786
When grief torments me, I cry sometimes too.

468
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:03,204
Let it never be known that you are tormented

469
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:06,817
Even as the torment kills you.

470
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:08,781
I promise.

471
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:24,337
She's the one who wrote him the letters, Mum.

472
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,873
Farah Ibrahim.

473
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:40,693
He wasn't there in the morning.

474
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:43,207
So you want to see him there?

475
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,211
Yes.

476
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,779
I want that he should show up once more.

477
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:47,876
You'll see,

478
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,651
I'll give him a right thrashing!

479
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:50,983
Enough, Farah.

480
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,326
He's Arifa's brother.

481
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,072
What if he's Arifa's brother?

482
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:56,915
Every cad has an honourable sister.

483
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:58,046
The poor lass.

484
00:35:58,046 --> 00:35:59,846
She's my friend, Farah.

485
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:03,377
And only I know how distressed she must be after that day.

486
00:36:03,377 --> 00:36:05,405
I have all my sympathies for her,

487
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:07,706
But I can't help it.

488
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:17,948
What happened?

489
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:20,451
No idea. I'll go and check.

490
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,834
Look over there.

491
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,710
What's there?

492
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,457
This is the same ground, isn't it,

493
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:39,628
Where he'd sit with his lunch box?

494
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:41,580
So what?

495
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,557
Why are we talking about him?

496
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:45,414
We're not talking about him, Farah.

497
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:49,034
His mention's just coming up.

498
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,010
Will it get moving again or remain here?

499
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:56,531
Give me two minutes. There's a problem with the wiring; I'll fix it.

500
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:01,919
Offer your prayers

501
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,252
If there's someone's mausoleum here.

502
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,859
It does feel, indeed,

503
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:07,999
As if it's someone's mausoleum there.

504
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,421
Over there,

505
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:12,945
That's where the cricket ball had hit his lunch box,

506
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:17,645
And his piece of bread flung out of his hand.

507
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,964
There's a mausoleum over there,

508
00:37:19,964 --> 00:37:22,714
Where he's interred his heart.

509
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,398
You've started smoking?

510
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,316
I'm telling Molvi Sahab!

511
00:38:01,424 --> 00:38:02,600
Alladio!

512
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,961
Alladio!

513
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,446
Hey, Alladio!

514
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:06,514
Hey!

515
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:07,308
You --

516
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:08,573
Listen!

517
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:09,963
Stop!

518
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,396
C'mon, Rashid --

519
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:23,186
Wait, Rashid.

520
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:34,779
Do you have the slightest shame?

521
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,785
Farah, let's go --

522
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:37,285
Hey! Get off!

523
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:40,376
Let me see who's the boss!

524
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,190
Now that your engagement plan failed,

525
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,943
You stand in my way to get even?

526
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,156
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

527
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:51,872
Want to besmirch my reputation?

528
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:55,107
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son,

529
00:38:55,107 --> 00:39:02,439
So I thought you'd not step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

530
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,924
You'd drown in shame,

531
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:08,390
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

532
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,202
But you turned out so brazen!

533
00:39:11,202 --> 00:39:13,661
Roaming around in the streets like this!

534
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:15,917
You consider the humiliation your exploit?

535
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:16,817
Enough, Farah!

536
00:39:16,817 --> 00:39:18,087
Le's go --
-Hey!

537
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:20,595
Put a sock in it!

538
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:24,514
Look at him!

539
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:27,468
Staring right back!

540
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:30,021
Come, Afzal.
-No.

541
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,448
Wait.

542
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:41,492
I'm saying this for the last time:

543
00:39:41,492 --> 00:39:43,563
If I see you around one more time,

544
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:46,890
No one in Hyderabad will ever see you again!
-Farah!

545
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,074
I'm coming!

546
00:39:49,385 --> 00:39:54,385
