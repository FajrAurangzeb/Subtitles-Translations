1
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:13,467
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:18,745
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:23,886
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:30,171
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:35,701
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,554
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:15,881 --> 00:01:16,896
My Afzal!

8
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,542
He's alright, isn't he?

9
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,476
Yes, he's --

10
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,694
He's alright.

11
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:24,334
Sit down.

12
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,405
Sit...

13
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:30,568
If...

14
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:34,548
If you are tormented like this,

15
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:38,365
It'd be a great difficulty for me.

16
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:42,915
This lordly wont of yours of whacking him,

17
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:46,256
Get this out of yourself!

18
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:49,607
Your son's a young man.

19
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,955
And he's --

20
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:54,786
Out of control, at that.

21
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,545
What if, one of these days,

22
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:58,283
He went astray?

23
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:00,298
So?

24
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,845
You've forgotten already!

25
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,148
He threatens us

26
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,813
With his departure

27
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,910
From here!

28
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,139
Should I yield to his threats?

29
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,062
It won't be this way, Molvi Sahab,

30
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:13,328
If he does something wrong,

31
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,546
I'll whack him.

32
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,283
Right, then, stand firm on your intentions!

33
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:19,035
But remember, also,

34
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,932
That it won't be like this every time.

35
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:24,364
One of these days, you'll wake up

36
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:29,614
To the news that he's boarded the 3.15 a.m. train and left!

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,589
This is why

38
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,910
I'm keeping good terms with the Doctor.

39
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,606
So that if I have to tell you something like this,

40
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,030
I would

41
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,370
Bring the Doctor along

42
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,175
And say to him,

43
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:57,811
'Keep all his heart medicines ready'.

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,827
'I'm about to tell Ruqaiyya'.

45
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,647
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah], Molvi Sahab!

46
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,819
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

47
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:19,631
You just told me.

48
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,982
The blighter's left?

49
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,690
If he boarded the 3.15 a.m. train, he'd have arrived there by now.

50
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:40,407
You're alright, aren't you?

51
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,711
You wept at your Mum's death,

52
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,073
That's when I last saw those tears.

53
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,799
And then, I'm seeing them today.

54
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:13,858
Fear God, Molvi Sahab.

55
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:17,823
Don't vilify my Afzal with your tears.

56
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:28,525
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

57
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:30,486
It's beating like a train.

58
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:32,199
Chuff-chuff!

59
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,931
You --

60
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,146
You're alright, aren't you?

61
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,313
What does it look like?

62
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,425
So what if I'm Afzal's mother?

63
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:48,009
I'm also Molvi Subhanallah's wife.

64
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:39,346
And the breakfast too.

65
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,742
You've come from Lahore?

66
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,220
You stare as if you're from Lahore.

67
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,051
Right, old chap,

68
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,402
How much will it be?
-40.

69
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,582
How do the Lahoris stare?

70
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,584
Like I used to.

71
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,650
When I came here from Lahore, I used to stare at people like you do.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,660
Where are you from?

73
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,100
Nowhere.

74
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,502
You looking for a place to rent?

75
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:10,830
Nobody came to get you when you got off the bus,

76
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,648
You had your breakfast at the bistro and are sitting at the bus stop.

77
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:17,672
Which means you've come here like a certain Lahori.

78
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,810
Won't you check what kind of a man I am?

79
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,892
Alright, tell me what kind you are.

80
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,613
I'm not the good kind.

81
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,220
Then come along.

82
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,220
I'm not the good kind either.

83
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,896
However fast you stravaig about,

84
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:47,254
You can't get to Karachi.

85
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:48,821
He's gone.

86
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,004
He's switched off his phone.

87
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,536
Now, you can't apologise to him even if you want to.

88
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:57,222
Why would I apologise to him?

89
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,840
I've begun to augur like you.

90
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,067
Like you knew last night that he's going.

91
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,659
You'd even said,

92
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,164
'He's out now', 'He's gotten there', 'He's left'!

93
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:13,473
Just like that, I have a feeling you're desperate to apologise to him.

94
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,550
Of course, I'm not!

95
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,238
I hear words like these as an augury.

96
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,082
But wait and watch what happens in the evening.

97
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:22,797
What'll happen in the evening?

98
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:25,085
I'd find you on the terrace.

99
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,174
So?

100
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:26,852
So what?

101
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:29,761
Let the evening come; you'll see...

102
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:32,402
Does he have another number?

103
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:33,980
I'm pitying

104
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,182
His Mum and Dad.

105
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,104
If he turned back and returned,

106
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,354
I wouldn't have any objections to apologising.

107
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:44,485
Just for...

108
00:08:44,485 --> 00:08:46,752
Humanity's sake?

109
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,928
Ask your Dad not to lead the prayers for a few days.

110
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:40,262
Only the Lord can take care of a prayer

111
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:44,970
That constantly reminds one of the son...

112
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,210
I could bathe six times with so much water.

113
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,722
And within five minutes,

114
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,827
Not a drop will drip from the tap.

115
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,966
Oh? Why is that?

116
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:27,556
She cuts off the water supply at 8.

117
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:28,870
Who?

118
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,512
The landlady's daughter.

119
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,834
So

120
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,914
Why don't you talk to the landlady?

121
00:10:36,914 --> 00:10:38,699
Don't you pay the rent?

122
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:40,130
I used to.

123
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,131
But I've not been for four months.

124
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,630
How much is the rent?

125
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,247
6,000.

126
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,883
6,000 a month?

127
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:50,383
Yes.

128
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,240
How say I pay it?

129
00:10:54,094 --> 00:10:57,024
The total amount of 24,000?

130
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,836
Yes.

131
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,170
Pay it.

132
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,106
But steel yourself for you won't be getting it back.

133
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:06,501
I won't demand it.

134
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,073
Oh...

135
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:11,700
You're developing a relationship, eh?

136
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:13,751
Yes.

137
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,524
Tell me...

138
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:26,625
Tell me something about yourself.

139
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,561
What do you do?

140
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,061
What's your name?

141
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,919
Tell me, what's his name!

142
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:39,998
Hey!

143
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:40,982
Tell me!

144
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:41,898
That's --

145
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,863
There's a girl screaming!

146
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:47,363
You get to hear this on Saturday nights.

147
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:51,062
The shinach comes steamin' fou.

148
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:52,988
The shinach is her husband.

149
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:56,674
Then, he remembers his wife's old affair.

150
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,760
What's he full of?

151
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:00,985
You belong to this world, don't you?

152
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,871
Don't you know what it means to be fou?

153
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,342
Oh...

154
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,119
That stuff.

155
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,295
Not 'that stuff',

156
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,130
The sup.

157
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,493
The pric pwdin drinks the bevvy.

158
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,199
Then, he asks his wife what his name is;

159
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,229
He knows the name well, but asks regardless.

160
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:15,965
'Where did you meet', 'Where do you talk',

161
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:19,533
'Where did you meet', 'What did the two of you do' - Every single detail.

162
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,419
And she tells him everything?

163
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:23,963
She's told him before her marriage.

164
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:25,614
Now, she just

165
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,624
Takes a right walloping, and says...

166
00:12:27,624 --> 00:12:29,713
Stop it, will you?

167
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,431
You've donged me twice already!

168
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:33,624
Everyone will hear it

169
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,250
If I scream.

170
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,938
Be done with it already!

171
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:04,588
It doesn't look proper for a man to cry.

172
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,398
There!

173
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:07,557
Please stay quiet!

174
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,780
Let me do the talking.

175
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:19,938
Step aside.
-Wait, Yasmin!

176
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,119
Step aside!

177
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,085
I'll clobber him today!

178
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:23,908
Leave it be.

179
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:26,588
He's crying in a corner now.

180
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:37,959
Who's...

181
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,206
Who's this girl?

182
00:13:39,206 --> 00:13:41,435
She's the landlady's daughter.

183
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:45,131
She's the blighter who cuts off the water supply here.

184
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:47,041
Don't peek from the window;

185
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,863
If she saw you, she'd turn and barge in here. Come in.

186
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:50,984
Why would she come?

187
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:54,484
I'm not allowed to have guests stay over; come in.

188
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:14,690
Yes, Dad?

189
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,320
Sit.

190
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,591
Why are you so anxious?

191
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,138
No?

192
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,038
It's nothing like that.

193
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,220
You

194
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,964
Just called me so suddenly...

195
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,919
I figured it must be something important.

196
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,089
Now, what it is...

197
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,918
I'm anxious to think about that.

198
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:56,421
Your going to London is nothing to get anxious about.

199
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,108
I'm going to London?

200
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:00,303
That's what I'm asking - when would you leave?

201
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:01,984
Never.

202
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,032
What are you saying?

203
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:06,282
I mean, what's the need to go to London?

204
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,383
I'm all alone.

205
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:09,551
What would I do there?

206
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:12,948
But your mother told me you'd rather not get married.

207
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,162
Not at all, Dad...

208
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,579
I didn't say that I'd not get married.

209
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,285
I said I'd rather not get married now.

210
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:20,567
I would in a year or two.

211
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,427
What about your MPhil, then?

212
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,334
I'll pursue it in Karachi.

213
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:26,913
We have a house there, too!

214
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:29,688
Lubna can come along too.

215
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,150
When did you think of this?

216
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,497
The same day I thought

217
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,969
That I'd not go to London at all.

218
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,130
You seem a bit disturbed.

219
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,332
Tell me if there's any problem.

220
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:46,348
You may take your time if the haste has gotten you perplexed.

221
00:15:46,348 --> 00:15:48,964
Think carefully.

222
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:52,644
Discuss it with your Mum or Lubna.

223
00:15:52,975 --> 00:15:53,856
Alright.

224
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:57,877
I'll discuss it with Lubna.
-Sit.

225
00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,634
What is your problem?

226
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,097
There's no problem.

227
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,616
Everything's alright, Dad.

228
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:08,775
What's alright?

229
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:13,025
I'm your father, not a chickpea chapman!

230
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm talking to you about your career!

231
00:16:17,483 --> 00:16:19,473
So what have I done?

232
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:23,451
You're telling me after giving all the answers that you'd discuss it with Lubna?

233
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:25,172
But it was you who'd said,

234
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:27,382
'Discuss it with Lubna'...

235
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,221
Alright, call Lubna here.

236
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,829
She's standing outside.

237
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,456
Come in, Lubna.

238
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:35,828
Lubna, come in.

239
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,679
I've told Dad that you're --

240
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,362
Just out there.

241
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:46,975
Yes, Dad?

242
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,936
What were you doing, standing outside?

243
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,564
Nothing, Dad.

244
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:52,226
I'd come with her.

245
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:54,901
Then, I realised that it was just supposed to be between the two of you.

246
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:57,306
So, I thought I'd stand outside.

247
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,121
Come and sit.

248
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,127
What is going on in her mind these days?

249
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:10,965
Karachi.

250
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:12,651
It's --

251
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,384
Right...

252
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:18,251
So the two of you have talked about Karachi already.

253
00:17:18,251 --> 00:17:19,919
Yes...

254
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,897
And what would you do there?

255
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:23,937
I?

256
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:26,274
What would I do, Dad?

257
00:17:26,274 --> 00:17:30,386
You've still got three semesters left.

258
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:31,922
Semesters?

259
00:17:31,922 --> 00:17:36,673
If you've talked about it, haven't you thought about your admission?

260
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,188
What if the first semester goes to waste?

261
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,975
Alright, you don't have to worry about anything;

262
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,347
You would get admitted.

263
00:17:49,347 --> 00:17:54,179
But has either of you thought about what'd happen to us over here?

264
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,023
The two of you would be left alone...

265
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:59,516
Thank goodness, Mademoiselle remembers as much.

266
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:01,687
How could I not remember?

267
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:03,351
How would you stay alone?

268
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:06,733
I'm not leaving you.

269
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:10,411
Get her out, Lubna.

270
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:15,274
She'll shred my brain into a spaghetti.

271
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:17,997
Discuss it thoroughly with her today,

272
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,817
And tell me what it is that she wants tomorrow.

273
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,356
Come.

274
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,070
Good night, Dad...

275
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,187
Why have you come to Karachi?

276
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,626
Looking for a job?

277
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,430
To become a great man.

278
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,810
So are you a twopenny-halfpenny man?

279
00:18:59,617 --> 00:19:05,117
Nowhere will you find a great man if he's not inside you.

280
00:19:11,844 --> 00:19:14,442
Why did you come to Karachi?

281
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,918
Don't ask me anything, boyo...

282
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:21,467
Then don't ask me anything either.

283
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,590
I'll see whose oul' fella's got the guts to stop me once I become a great man!

284
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,910
Give me the gasper.

285
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:48,656
25 runs were needed to win in the last over of a match.

286
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:52,595
Everybody thought it's impossible.

287
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:58,517
Because when you need 25 runs to win in the last over, you can't make it.

288
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,960
But I made it.

289
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:15,340
Didn't he realise why you're talking about going to Karachi?

290
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,026
Realise, as in?

291
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:20,528
I've told him clearly that I'll be pursuing my MPhil there.

292
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:24,936
He was chuffed to hear that I dropped the option of London.

293
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,665
For Afzal?

294
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:29,490
What?

295
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:31,688
Why for Afzal?

296
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,440
Am I pursuing my MPhil for him?

297
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,597
Are you touched in the head?

298
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:37,150
Then why Karachi?

299
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,939
Why not Lahore or Islamabad?

300
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:46,237
Do I look like a moran?

301
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:48,844
I know you inside out, Farah Ibrahim.

302
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:52,723
That is why Dad's asked me to find out what you're up to.

303
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:55,896
So you think I'm going after Afzal?

304
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:56,970
You loony lass,

305
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,744
If I had to go after him,

306
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:02,744
Why did I let him out of here in the first place?

307
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,789
But, because of him, I've thought

308
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,316
That one should not leave one's parents like this.

309
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,472
I keep on thinking about Aunt Ruqaiyya

310
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,693
And Molvi Sahab.

311
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,338
They've only one son,

312
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,674
One so magnificent [= Afzal] at that!

313
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,133
I don't believe this.

314
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,012
What don't you believe?

315
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:29,650
Your intentions and actions

316
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,351
Are polar opposites.

317
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:35,119
You remember him more than his Mum and Dad!

318
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:36,810
You'll get whacked by me now.

319
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,103
I'd take it.

320
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:42,239
But I won't go with you on this SAR mission with you!

321
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,116
I'm not insisting that you do.

322
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:45,761
Don't come if you don't want to.

323
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,869
I'd just mentioned your name to ease Dad.

324
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:51,420
How does it ease Dad?

325
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,981
If you're with me, I'd thought,

326
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:55,343
Mum and Dad would think I'm not alone there.

327
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:57,931
Someone's there to look after me.

328
00:21:57,931 --> 00:21:59,258
A fib.

329
00:21:59,258 --> 00:22:00,804
I can swear on it.

330
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:02,915
So you're not going after him?

331
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:05,141
Ask forgiveness of God!

332
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,223
And you don't love him either?

333
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:09,716
God forgive!

334
00:22:12,428 --> 00:22:13,771
Place your hand on my head.

335
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:15,537
Swear on me.

336
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:17,570
I swear by you.

337
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:19,873
But if I chance upon him somewhere,

338
00:22:19,873 --> 00:22:22,034
I'd grab him by his collar.

339
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:23,199
Why?

340
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,094
I'll say, 'Come to Hyderabad, you blighter'!

341
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,466
'Your Mum and Dad are looking for you'.

342
00:22:27,466 --> 00:22:29,093
Who are you to say that?

343
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,708
I mean, if he asked,

344
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,917
'Who are you to ask this'?

345
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,485
'Who are you to me'?

346
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,669
'And who do you mean by Mum and Dad'?

347
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:39,279
'The same you'd invited over and humiliated'?

348
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,435
'And before whom'

349
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,168
'You'd humiliated me at my home'?

350
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,892
What would you say to that?

351
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:46,270
Would he say all of that?

352
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,095
As if he'd laud you for grabbing him by the collar!

353
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:50,331
Remember,

354
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:51,957
It's his turn now.

355
00:22:51,957 --> 00:22:56,139
You got him out of Hyderabad, and this fact won't ever get out of his heart.

356
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,165
He'll get even with you one day.

357
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,998
Get even?

358
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:04,893
'Like a king would treat another'.

359
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,463
How would a king treat another?

360
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:09,004
I'll tell you tomorrow.

361
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,910
I don't know it well enough.

362
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,990
But I have a feeling it's very cruel.

363
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,504
Step aside.

364
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:10,858
Where's that blighter Babu Hamid?

365
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:12,494
Babu Hamid!

366
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,142
Babu Hamid!

367
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,500
Babu Hamid!

368
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,170
Now where did he go?

369
00:24:21,966 --> 00:24:24,157
And who would you be?

370
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,675
Good Lord, it's you!

371
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,175
What are you doing here?

372
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:31,887
Have we met before?

373
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,575
Met, as in?

374
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,388
Do we have those meetings?

375
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,432
Not at all --

376
00:24:36,432 --> 00:24:38,713
You just said, 'It's you'.

377
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:41,512
Pray tell, who?

378
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,417
I saw you in the train.

379
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,096
You were coming to Karachi from Lahore.

380
00:24:46,096 --> 00:24:49,481
No, I was on the train from Lahore to Karachi.

381
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,495
You don't have the manners to sit at your place,

382
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:56,038
Spreading your legs as if they're someone else's!

383
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,093
Go.

384
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:05,915
'Go'?

385
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,486
Would you leave yourself or do I need to grab your hand and drag you out?

386
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:10,606
What?

387
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:12,388
What did you just say?

388
00:25:12,388 --> 00:25:14,254
You'd drag me out

389
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:15,416
Of here?

390
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,759
Out of this house?

391
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,819
And you'd grab my hand, too!

392
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,286
That's tidy; tell me,

393
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,864
Where are you from?

394
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:26,535
In which city of the world is it a trend that it's no problem if you grab Yasmin's hand like that?

395
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:28,314
I've come from Hyderabad.

396
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:30,705
And if you said again that I'm tailing you,

397
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:33,224
I'd thro --
-Throw?

398
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:34,810
Mam!

399
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:36,758
Mam!

400
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:37,835
Mam!

401
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,473
Your Mum's the same one, is she?

402
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:41,779
From the train?

403
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,860
You're going to --

404
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,170
Just end this quarrel and leave.

405
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,713
There's no Babu Hamid around here.

406
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,939
How come?

407
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,548
I'm Babu Hamid.

408
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:54,721
I'd just gone to get some breakfast.

409
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,628
You've kept her standing all this time?

410
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:58,890
As if he'd have me sit, Syr Babu!

411
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,592
He was about to throw me out.

412
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,593
Who's this blighter?

413
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:05,220
Such a brash girl!

414
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,580
Shut up, boyo, she's my landlady.

415
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,327
He's -- no blighter either,

416
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:13,982
He's a rather topping [Afzal] type.

417
00:26:13,982 --> 00:26:16,236
You've come to collect the rent, haven't you?

418
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:19,478
You're saying as if you've got the money in your pocket!

419
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:20,311
That's it.

420
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,005
I have it in my pocket since the morning.

421
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:23,605
Hold this, will you?

422
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:25,769
Right here.

423
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,550
That's a total of 24,000 there.

424
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,555
But what's he doing here?

425
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:42,112
If he's come to meet, that's alright,

426
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:45,068
If he's here to stay, show him out right now. C'mon!

427
00:26:45,068 --> 00:26:45,678
Get out!

428
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:47,301
No -- He can't leave.

429
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:52,701
How wouldn't he? Even his Tad would --
-If you mentioned my Dad, I'd break your face!

430
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Good Lord!

431
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,223
He's a ruffian!

432
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:58,471
No, he's --
-Mam!

433
00:26:58,793 --> 00:26:59,765
Mam!

434
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:00,795
A ruffian!

435
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,415
Why does she call out to her Mum every time?

436
00:27:02,415 --> 00:27:05,103
She's got no one except her Mum.
-Mum, a ruffian!

437
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:08,090
Mum, a ruffian's broken in!
-Why doesn't she come here, then?

438
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,644
She's wise.

439
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:12,108
What's that bosh?

440
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,637
It's just that you don't know the true story...

441
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:17,783
These 24,000 you have clenched in your hands,

442
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,067
He's paid it.

443
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:22,419
If you kick him out, your money's obviously out the door too.

444
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:23,647
So, either you can

445
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:24,968
Return the money,

446
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:28,858
Or just talk to your Mam for once.

447
00:27:35,835 --> 00:27:36,987
Alright.

448
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,748
I'll be back after talking to Mam.

449
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,331
That's tidy.

450
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,260
She won't be coming back.

451
00:27:46,473 --> 00:27:47,126
Why?

452
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:48,329
She's a blighter,

453
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,218
She won't ask; she'll be advising,

454
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:52,720
'To the devil with all sorrows if we're getting the rent on time'.

455
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,844
Alright, let's just have breakfast, shall we?

456
00:27:54,844 --> 00:27:56,762
Come. Here.

457
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:00,040
Where are the plates -- Oh, right.

458
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:08,482
Don't let her go to Karachi.

459
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,950
I won't let her go anywhere until she's been married.

460
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,051
Then talk it out with her straight.

461
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,551
Everything's been talked about.

462
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:20,682
You don't talk, Madame, you chaffer.

463
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:24,091
'Talk' as in, explain it to her.

464
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,024
And 'explain' as in, she's got to agree.

465
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:30,602
She's not being reasonable when deciding.

466
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,893
She acts first and thinks later.

467
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,691
It was just yesterday

468
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,890
She was ready to wager everything to be able to go to London.

469
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,888
And today, she's suddenly figured that she should be going to Karachi?

470
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:45,484
Do you know why she wants to go to Karachi?

471
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:48,034
Because Afzal's left home and gone to Karachi.

472
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:50,359
Are you in your senses?

473
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,068
We've talked to her about Afzal already.

474
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:54,665
Has she forgotten

475
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:56,472
The day she'd insulted Afzal?

476
00:28:56,472 --> 00:29:00,018
Once, before us, and then again, at his home!

477
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,299
You've forgotten too,

478
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:03,312
You'd said just a short while ago,

479
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:05,521
'She acts first and thinks later'.

480
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:10,890
So, she's thinking right now that she had not been fair on Afzal.

481
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,036
Good morning.

482
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:14,500
Good morning.

483
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,731
Good morning.
-Good morning.

484
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:23,573
So you've decided to go to Karachi?

485
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:24,994
Yes?

486
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:27,344
I'd told you already.

487
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,950
Think over it again.

488
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:33,774
Why should I need to think over it again?

489
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,502
I've decided this after a lot of thinking.

490
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:37,744
That's what you think.

491
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:42,326
Everyone else thinks that you'd ponder over it after you've left.

492
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,978
Why are you making an issue of it?

493
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:46,587
You should be delighted.

494
00:29:46,587 --> 00:29:49,035
I'm not delighted.

495
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,010
That's why I've decided that you're not going to Karachi.

496
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:29,508
What is going on?

497
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,966
Care to tell me?

498
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:32,682
How could I tell you?

499
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,698
I haven't the foggiest about what it is Dad wants to talk about.

500
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:36,803
Put a sock in it!

501
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:37,684
Dad said

502
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:39,323
That I'd think after I've left,

503
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:42,121
And that everybody thinks this way.

504
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,805
'Everybody thinks this way' as in,

505
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:46,132
'You think this way', too.

506
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:49,338
But I'd only told Mum about this,

507
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:51,984
And said that it's strictly confidential.

508
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,263
What?

509
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:55,511
She was working on your character sketch.

510
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:59,117
She was trying to fathom her Farah's noble qualities.

511
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:00,056
I thought

512
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:03,630
She didn't know about this one.

513
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:08,311
But don't worry.

514
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:12,315
Dad will think about who it is he's messing with.

515
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,110
Say your prayers.

516
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:16,877
Why?

517
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,130
Do you doubt my belief?

518
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,915
I doubt that you're even alive!

519
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:21,924
Say your prayers,

520
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:24,995
Or you'd be herded along with the sinners!

521
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,002
What are you looking for?

522
00:31:29,002 --> 00:31:31,260
I'm looking for a knife!

523
00:31:31,658 --> 00:31:33,513
You'd kill me?

524
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:34,580
Let me just find a knife,

525
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,199
I'll tell you!

526
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:36,924
Hey!

527
00:31:36,924 --> 00:31:38,920
Don't talk about bloodshed.

528
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,078
Just go and say it plainly that you've fallen for Afzal,

529
00:31:42,078 --> 00:31:44,578
And you're going after him.

530
00:31:53,936 --> 00:31:55,071
Bring your head over here.

531
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,479
What'd you do with my head?

532
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:59,308
Place my hand on it and swear that I don't love Afzal!

533
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,655
Just think as if

534
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,073
I've not exactly despised him.

535
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,017
There, now.

536
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:05,636
Don't surprise me.

537
00:32:05,636 --> 00:32:07,224
Why would you be surprised?

538
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:09,569
I have some experience too, Farah.

539
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:11,638
So what, if I've never fallen in love?

540
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,184
I have borne witness to love blossoming.

541
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,787
You haven't the 'e' of experience,

542
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:18,688
Not with your world going round thanks to devilry and bijoux!

543
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,498
Just let me get to Karachi,

544
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:26,057
I'll scupper all your experience and send it to Davy Jones' Locker!

545
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:32,422
There are only two ways out for me:

546
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,984
Drown in the ocean,

547
00:32:34,984 --> 00:32:38,371
Or surface and get across.

548
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,919
Honestly,

549
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,124
Have you come here after you lost in love?

550
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:47,950
I've triumphed in love and come.

551
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,074
And one who loves like me can never lose.

552
00:32:51,074 --> 00:32:54,174
Why, then, do you talk like you've lost?

553
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,809
Why did you say

554
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,283
That there's just two ways out for you?

555
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:01,080
There's but one road to love

556
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,676
That starts from the heart

557
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:06,457
And ends at the beloved's doorstep.

558
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,384
Is there someone in your way?

559
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:11,313
Yes.

560
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:12,737
Who?

561
00:33:13,197 --> 00:33:16,937
A twopenny-halfpenny man who looks like me.

562
00:33:16,937 --> 00:33:20,877
I had been hiding behind him,

563
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:23,447
Which is why she'd never seen me.

564
00:33:23,447 --> 00:33:27,057
How many runs did you score in the final over of the match?

565
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:28,327
25.

566
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:30,157
Amazing.

567
00:33:30,497 --> 00:33:35,857
Then, it'd do you good to hear and remember that love is a match that's all about the final over.

568
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:39,137
You'll only score as many runs as she'd want you to,

569
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:41,217
And if she does not,

570
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:42,797
On all six balls,

571
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:45,697
You may get beaten all ends up.

572
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:48,147
I know how to play cricket.

573
00:33:48,147 --> 00:33:51,111
And I've learnt to love.

574
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:55,905
Remember that if I ever needed to score 25 runs there,

575
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:58,960
I'd do it.

576
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:11,970
Otherwise, only my corse would be returning to Hyderabad.

577
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,500
Should it have to come to that,

578
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,224
Please send my corse with your own hands.

579
00:34:21,224 --> 00:34:25,705
And never say that I'm going back defeated.

580
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:28,548
Even if I'm beaten all ends up,

581
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:31,974
You'll see that I've won.

582
00:34:41,055 --> 00:34:41,907
And said,

583
00:34:41,907 --> 00:34:44,549
'I'd throw' --
-Throw?

584
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,866
And it's now that you're telling me!

585
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,815
He never said anything beyond that.

586
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:52,455
Wouldn't I have broken his jaw had he said anything?

587
00:34:52,455 --> 00:34:53,984
He did 'throw' you.

588
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:55,422
Isn't that enough?

589
00:34:55,422 --> 00:34:57,351
You and your words, Mam!

590
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,456
He didn't actually throw me,

591
00:34:58,456 --> 00:35:00,718
Just said it as they do!

592
00:35:00,718 --> 00:35:03,774
Who says such words to a girl?

593
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:06,261
I'll talk to him in the morning.

594
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:08,663
One should never tell you anything, Mam!

595
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:10,407
I told you, he just uttered it casually.

596
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:14,573
If you show him this fury or kick him out, we'll have to give him 24,000 back.

597
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,513
Why would we have to return it?

598
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:18,637
Because he's the one who'd given those.

599
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:20,452
And Babu Hamid?

600
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,530
He'll collect his 500 or 1,000 and leave.

601
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,964
I'll whack him on his face with a boot.

602
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:28,631
He'll take that boot but only leave after collecting his 500.

603
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:31,877
What are his dues, besides the rent?

604
00:35:31,877 --> 00:35:33,545
14,800.

605
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:34,437
No --

606
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:37,304
He'd given 600; now, he's got 14,200 due.

607
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,268
Alright, note it down, will you?

608
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:42,123
It'll be 14,700 tomorrow.

609
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,080
What happened?

610
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,900
Isn't it good?

611
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:02,065
It'll take a while.

612
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:07,211
It takes time to start liking and digest Karachi's food.

613
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:34,080
Would you prefer home-cooked food?

614
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,629
Where'd one get that?

615
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:36,617
You can.

616
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,323
Our landlady, you know,

617
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,355
She'd cook you some.

618
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:41,527
She'd charge for it each month, though.

619
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:42,739
Oh, her!

620
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:46,047
She'd serve it peppery!
-No, it's her Mam who cooks.

621
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:49,877
Back when I had some money, she was the one who'd provide me.

622
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,828
So when there's no money in it,

623
00:36:51,828 --> 00:36:52,887
There's no food?

624
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:53,964
No, boyo.

625
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,562
She does blabber a bit.

626
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:57,261
But she used to cook me food.

627
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:58,526
I had some shame,

628
00:36:58,526 --> 00:37:02,414
So I said I'd eaten something already whenever she asked.

629
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:04,414
You used to lie?

630
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:05,613
Yes,

631
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:08,572
Sometimes, I'd lie, too.

632
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,690
So what was the last thing you said?

633
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,159
He's been saying the same thing for 15 minutes.

634
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,308
That you cook the food and collect your money each month.

635
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:32,961
So,

636
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:34,242
How much would you take?

637
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:35,751
Ask him to shut his gob.

638
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:38,900
He has a bad reputation in Mam's eyes.

639
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,183
Go on.

640
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,979
What were you saying?

641
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:45,253
We'd serve you food and you'd pay us for it each month?

642
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:46,194
Exactly.

643
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,408
Just like old times?

644
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:49,851
Enjoyed your food for three months and gobbled up the payment for a month!

645
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,254
Talk to me.

646
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:52,610
I'll enjoy the food for two months

647
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,094
And pay you for three.

648
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,697
Ask him what he thinks I am.

649
00:37:58,697 --> 00:38:00,953
Hold it right there you lippy laddie!

650
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:04,737
I hand over 50 or a 100 to the likes of you every now and then!

651
00:38:04,737 --> 00:38:05,663
Anyway,

652
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:06,674
Go on.

653
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:07,835
Go on with what?

654
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,069
How much would you pay?

655
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:10,910
The payment would be the same old one.

656
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,565
8,000 a month?

657
00:38:12,565 --> 00:38:14,476
Remember how much potatoes cost back then?

658
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:16,362
And you'd get lentils for a 100 Rupees a kilogramme.

659
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:18,504
It's 120 now.

660
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,204
How much do spices cost?

661
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:22,683
Spices, let's see...

662
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,729
Why are you asking about spices?

663
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:28,419
No, it's just -- I thought you're mentioning the rates,

664
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,396
So you'd just as well mention the rate for spices as well.

665
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,256
Look,

666
00:38:31,256 --> 00:38:32,410
Let me get this straight,

667
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,541
I'll charge 10,000 per head for the food.

668
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,514
Let me know if it's okay; otherwise, I'm off.

669
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:38,363
I accept.

670
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
