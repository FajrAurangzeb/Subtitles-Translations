1
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:13,762
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:19,012
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:24,104
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:30,430
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,007
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:40,533
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:37,439
Doctor,

8
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,722
Her heart's fine, isn't it?

9
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,028
What happened to her heart?

10
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:48,603
It's all about the heart, Doctor; who knows what you're checking...

11
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:51,343
I can check her pulse, too;

12
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:55,880
A high or low blood pressure is evident from the way she talks,

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,917
But

14
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,731
I cannot know about her heart.

15
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,558
She's come back

16
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,893
From Karachi, wounded.

17
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,811
Please check thoroughly, there must be something wrong.

18
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:12,962
No, Molvi Sahab, her heart's fine.

19
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:14,713
Strange...

20
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:18,618
So, that means that when one is tormented,

21
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:23,987
The other person should not think that one's heart is tormented.

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,031
Won't you prescribe any medicines?

23
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:30,587
If not for the heart,

24
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:34,531
Please give her one for the torment.

25
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,220
There's no need.

26
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,567
Give her a sleeping pill if she cannot sleep.

27
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,659
2 mg.

28
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,548
Come, Doctor.

29
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:44,989
Wait, Molvi Sahab,

30
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,414
Let me write down the name of the pill.

31
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:48,819
There's no need for that.

32
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,094
I have a packet of sleeping pills in my pocket all the time.

33
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,153
Speaking of which,

34
00:02:56,153 --> 00:03:01,616
She won't even doze off for a minute with your 2 mg.

35
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,474
Alright, then.

36
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,652
That's it.
-Come.

37
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,070
Goodbye.

38
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,943
Goodbye, sir.

39
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,747
Come.

40
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,464
What do you feel?

41
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:33,747
I feel that he's not at home.

42
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,529
When the lass came yesterday,

43
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:44,980
It occurred to me that I should stop her,

44
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,030
Say that she should stay here,

45
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,101
And not go back.

46
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:57,710
She's nobody to me, so to speak,

47
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:03,338
But I feel that my Afzal's here when she comes.

48
00:04:03,338 --> 00:04:05,275
Farah?

49
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:08,450
When you say Farah like that,

50
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,261
It sounds as if she used to write him letters.

51
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,371
Even if she did not,

52
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:23,600
For the love of the Lord, she could've written one to save the life of a mother.

53
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,099
Or, just ask her not to come here.

54
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,291
Tell her

55
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,809
To let the dead remain interred in their graves,

56
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:35,087
And not come again and again to offer her prayers.

57
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:42,908
She'd come to tell that she's getting married.

58
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:46,755
There, now.

59
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,289
Hearing that, it felt

60
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,801
As if she's doing something wrong.

61
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,930
As if she's turning back after giving us her word.

62
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,000
She's doing what's best.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,497
She's doing what's best...

64
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:14,560
She's not doing what's best.

65
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,294
She was talking about him all the time.

66
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:23,808
She's in the same condition as you are.

67
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:26,650
Her heart is beating alright,

68
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,209
But grows restless.

69
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,799
No...

70
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,980
There's nothing to worry about, really.

71
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,864
Call whenever you want.

72
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,240
Whenever, as in,

73
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,275
Anytime.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,231
No need to get so romantic.

75
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,656
I know very well

76
00:06:34,656 --> 00:06:36,995
That no one truly loves these days,

77
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:40,290
And even when one does, one does not understand it.

78
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,700
Anyway, tell me, do you watch films?

79
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,635
Oh, no, I watch a lot!

80
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:50,174
Have you watched Chennai Express?

81
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,625
You shameless --

82
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,710
Yes...

83
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,069
I'd watched that scene, too,

84
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:57,491
But only secretly.

85
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:00,816
Farah was right by me, watching.

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,651
Whom are you chatting with?

87
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:06,273
Hey!

88
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,346
Is that even a question?

89
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,453
The same blighter?

90
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,007
Obviously.

91
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:16,399
Every girl's got just one blighter in her life.

92
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:22,132
Disconnect for now,

93
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,376
We'll talk at night.

94
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,774
Not at all --

95
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:28,822
She didn't call you a blighter.

96
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:29,582
Okay,

97
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,395
Bye.

98
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,600
He heard it!

99
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,528
Have some shame, Lubna.

100
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:38,976
You're head over heels for a killer?

101
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,245
You'll see, if he gets caught,

102
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,934
The police will be here too!

103
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,701
Why would they be here?

104
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,186
They'd be pleased to interrogate his beloved for a few days, too!

105
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:49,361
Don't tell me!

106
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,421
Anyway, though,

107
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,980
Who, in love,

108
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,375
Ever thinks of problems?

109
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,121
Have you seen Dad?

110
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,451
He's not mentioned him once

111
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:00,753
Since coming back from Karachi.

112
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:01,696
Right...

113
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,396
I've noticed that too.

114
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,533
Why are you calling him, then?

115
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,221
By the Lord, I'm not!

116
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,353
He calls me again and again.

117
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:11,563
Change your number

118
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:13,555
Just like he had.

119
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,391
But --

120
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,413
But what?

121
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:19,755
Would you settle only when Dad's been disgraced?

122
00:08:21,797 --> 00:08:23,777
Just think you made a mistake.

123
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:25,047
Ask forgiveness of God,

124
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,121
And get married and go to your home

125
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:29,814
As soon as your next semester's finished.

126
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:32,148
Whom would I marry?

127
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:32,939
Why?

128
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:35,718
Have the other psychiatrists in Hyderabad all died?

129
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,839
So I should marry a psychiatrist, too?

130
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,766
Put a sock in it!

131
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:41,385
As if I'm mad!

132
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,400
Do all of you think I'm mad?

133
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,743
Honestly, Lubna,

134
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:52,257
Why did Dad decide to get me married to that psychiatrist?

135
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,303
He's taken a liking to you.

136
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,998
He's lost his heart to you.

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,273
He pleaded before Dad,

138
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,083
And Dad thought he's a fine man,

139
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,916
And the most famous doctor in all of Hyderabad.

140
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,460
Don't call him a doctor!

141
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,114
The blighter's a psychiatrist.

142
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:08,601
Don't call him a blighter either,

143
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,055
It'd sink into his heart.

144
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,786
So what if it does?

145
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,453
Good Lord,

146
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,066
One doesn't insult one's would-be husband before marriage.

147
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:20,651
Otherwise, they exact their revenge.

148
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,758
I can't marry him.

149
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:25,041
What?

150
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,710
Why can't you?

151
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,346
But --

152
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,588
You just said 'yes' the other day!

153
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,118
For God's sake, Farah,

154
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:33,380
Dad's blood pressure would shoot up!

155
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,645
Lubna, look,

156
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,945
Please don't mind what I'm saying,

157
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,411
But the thing is

158
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,625
I can't marry anyone now.

159
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,983
I feel

160
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,450
As if my heart would fail

161
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,130
The moment the wedding procession would come for me.

162
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,730
Then discuss it with him.

163
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,651
With whom?

164
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:52,737
Your psychiatrist, of course!

165
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:55,287
He'd have a hundred cures.

166
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,472
Besides, he knows very well whom he's marrying.

167
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,238
He'd have gone through all his books again.

168
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:04,399
Nobody can cure me.

169
00:10:04,693 --> 00:10:07,226
I know I'm not alright,

170
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,001
But the bigger thing is

171
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,674
That I don't want to be cured in the first place.

172
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,060
Do you have his number?

173
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,356
Yes...

174
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,010
Call and ask him

175
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,232
To stay away from me,

176
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:23,676
Or I will murder him!

177
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,764
I don't love him,

178
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:52,260
But it feels like I'm in love.

179
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,500
Well, it isn't anything spectacular...

180
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,801
There's a great difference between feeling and being in love.

181
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,718
What's the difference?

182
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:01,181
I feel so today,

183
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:02,188
But you'll see,

184
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:05,248
I may not the very next day.

185
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,889
My heart will change one day

186
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,723
Just like he's changed his phone number.

187
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,364
You'd have seen it in Karachi, wouldn't you,

188
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,747
The clouds engulf the skies,

189
00:11:22,747 --> 00:11:25,096
But it doesn't rain.

190
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:27,800
The same has happened with me -

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,860
Clouds enveloped the skies,

192
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,673
But brought no rain.

193
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:40,409
<i>Every compeer abandoned me...</i>

194
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,533
You could get his number.

195
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,838
Sajid would have it.

196
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,769
Who's Sajid?

197
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:50,900
His friend.

198
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,902
An old one.

199
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:56,363
And how would we get Sajid's number?

200
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,823
I have it with me.

201
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:00,073
Just ask him

202
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,941
To let you talk to Afzal,

203
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,810
Or give his number.

204
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,818
Why would he let me talk to him?

205
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:08,506
He'd ask, 'Who are you'? 'What do you want with him'?

206
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:11,052
Just say you're a friend of Samina's.

207
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:14,109
He won't ask anything then.

208
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:18,730
I'll take my leave.

209
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,030
Give me his number.

210
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,772
Right...

211
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,744
Look it up.

212
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,528
If you look up 'Hyderabad',

213
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,496
You'd see his number.

214
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,967
Hello?

215
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,142
It's Sajid, innit?

216
00:13:01,142 --> 00:13:03,619
Yes; who are you?

217
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:06,359
Samina.

218
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,080
S --

219
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,988
I think it's a girl.

220
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,040
Didn't his 'S --' tell you?

221
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,310
It's Samina.

222
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,481
No.

223
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,477
Samina would never call him.

224
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,500
Come again, who are you?

225
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:37,060
Oh --

226
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,397
It's Samina.

227
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:39,632
Didn't you recognise me?

228
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,193
In the last two years,

229
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:44,807
I've recognised Samina's voice better than her.

230
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,259
Tell me, who are you?

231
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,098
I'm a friend of Samina's, Yasmin.

232
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,306
And I've gotten this number because I need something.

233
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,929
What do you need?

234
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:56,015
Give me Afzal's number.

235
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,594
I'd have to ask Afzal about that.

236
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,602
Do you ask for Afzal's permission to eat?

237
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:02,287
What?

238
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:06,746
You love Samina, don't you?

239
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,010
The two of you didn't get married, innit?

240
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,016
Yes...

241
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,730
It's good that you weren't!

242
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,480
If the lad's not manly, he should remain single like you!

243
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,986
Note down his number.

244
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,933
Go on.

245
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,904
Thank you.

246
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,552
Good morning.

247
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,495
Good morning.

248
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:48,117
Please, come.

249
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:49,461
Take these flowers.

250
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:51,656
Give the flowers to her.

251
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:52,942
You've got two hours.

252
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:56,559
Once Mum and Dad get back, you won't be able to talk.

253
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:58,257
Where is she?

254
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:00,268
She's mostly in her room.

255
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:02,554
She comes out once in a while if she's delighted.

256
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:03,685
Is she ever delighted?

257
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,388
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,998
She was a right lively lass.

259
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:09,375
She'd be rollicking about everywhere!

260
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,291
Patients like her are right lively in the beginning.

261
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,055
Rollicking about everywhere.

262
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:14,660
They then turn all quiet, then.

263
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,094
What kind of patients?

264
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,793
You won't get it.

265
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:26,080
Those who fall in love become patients requiring constant and thorough attention.

266
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,919
Are you out of your mind?

267
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,701
You're calling those who love 'patients'?

268
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,682
I said you won't get it.

269
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,735
But I'm honest.

270
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,947
It's the world's one truly immedicable affliction...

271
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,139
Love?

272
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,203
Yes.

273
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,859
And what a pleasant stroke of serendipity

274
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,486
Is it

275
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:46,121
That people are overjoyed to fall in love.

276
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:49,644
Just think about one's mental condition!

277
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,727
As if one's afflicted with cancer,

278
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,080
And he's calling his friends, telling them,

279
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,927
'Buddy, you know',

280
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:57,304
'I'm in cancer'.

281
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,941
Shut up, Mr Sibtain!

282
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:02,913
Don't say such things before her.

283
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,405
Please, call her.

284
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:06,638
I don't usually

285
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,354
See patients on Sundays.

286
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:09,946
Get yourself treated,

287
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,156
Or a certain party might beat you with shoes.

288
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,625
Party?

289
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,353
Yes.

290
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:16,799
Those who love are a certain kind of party,

291
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,323
And the party of the heartbroken is the most dangerous.

292
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:22,690
If you said such things before them,

293
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,585
They'd beat you black and blue until your brain's french-fried!

294
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,904
So, when your sister's cured,

295
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:32,710
You'll realise that I fix the brains of those in love.

296
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,780
Hey!

297
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,930
When you said that you've fallen in love,

298
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,700
Were you lying then?

299
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,423
How did you figure I'm lying?

300
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,692
How could you be in love,

301
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:44,871
Seeing that you're saying so much against love?

302
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,860
Have you heard of bird flu?

303
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,059
Or the Congo Virus?

304
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:54,510
That wretched Congo Virus killed many doctors who went to treat it!

305
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,940
Can't you talk in simpler terms?

306
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,544
The simple point is simply

307
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:02,252
That if the doctor can catch the Congo Virus,

308
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:03,990
Then, the doctor who goes in to cure it

309
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,707
Can catch love from the patient, too.

310
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,686
Doctors have feelings too.

311
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,602
A doctor's not made of stone.

312
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:15,110
He has feelings and emotions, too.

313
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,506
And then, everyone 'round here's eager to die.

314
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:20,245
I can't handle it.

315
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,151
Okay...

316
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:24,422
I'll call her here.

317
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,822
I'm coming...

318
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,758
Peace be upon you!

319
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:45,160
And upon you, peace.
-Come, please come, Mr Paracha...

320
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,799
And upon you, peace.
-Please, come in.

321
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:54,800
I'd known it, Mr Paracha,

322
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,360
That you'd remember me again in just a few days,

323
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,870
But I have humbly pleaded with you,

324
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,250
And begged forgiveness, too,

325
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,680
That I like the courage now

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,270
To stand

327
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,920
At the Prophet's tribune.

328
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,200
No, Molvi Sahab --

329
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,120
It's not about the Mosque or the tribune,

330
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,000
But I've come to you

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,925
With a problem.

332
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,882
Yes?

333
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,626
Problem?

334
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,773
Just give me your orders,

335
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:36,154
And it would be my fortune if I could be of any help.

336
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,230
Right...

337
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,455
Thank you very much...

338
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,910
Firstly, congratulations to you.

339
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,323
In fact, congratulations from all of us.

340
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,025
Sir?

341
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,710
What for?
-Oh, Molvi Sahab!

342
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,870
Afzal has, with the Lord's grace, conquered Karachi in a blink, so to speak.

343
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,055
His name resounds throughout.

344
00:18:56,055 --> 00:19:01,230
And he's even given the hoodlums a proper beating!

345
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,406
Mr Paracha,

346
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,632
Talk about your problem.

347
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,260
Molvi Sahab,

348
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,930
It's nothing much, really,

349
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,490
But the thing is --

350
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,991
Your nephews Haroon and Mamoon

351
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:21,119
Had started a business of literature about saving lives.

352
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,068
Yes...

353
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,732
And

354
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:29,980
Some blackguard sent them a slip demanding 200,000 Rupees.

355
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,630
I have the slip with me.

356
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,050
Here it is.

357
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,370
I --

358
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,094
What'd I do with it?

359
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:42,764
Molvi Sahab,

360
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,792
Give this slip to Afzal,

361
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,340
And tell him to give that blackguard a scolding.

362
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,181
His mere scolding is enough, Molvi Sahab!

363
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:56,320
Keep this slip in your pocket, Mr Paracha.

364
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,867
You're saying his mere scolding is enough,

365
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,611
And I'm saying

366
00:20:04,611 --> 00:20:09,480
That even dying of this shame won't be enough for me.

367
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,066
Sir?

368
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:16,040
I regret to say that you're the first person in the entire neighbourhood

369
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,340
Whom I'm telling with utmost sorrow

370
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,480
That I've decided

371
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,030
To disown Afzal.

372
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,670
I am henceforth not responsible for any word or deed of his.

373
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,400
If the Lord so wills,

374
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,970
One of these days, this news will be printed in the newspapers, too,

375
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,190
Which will serve as a testimonial for all of you.

376
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,451
Why are you standing here?

377
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:51,110
Please, come in; have some tea, perhaps?

378
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,809
No, Molvi Sahab.

379
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,305
Thank you very much.

380
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:56,464
I'll take my leave.

381
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,257
Alright.

382
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:01,254
In the Lord's protection.

383
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,640
Here.

384
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:12,805
Listen to another one, Ruqaiyya Begum!

385
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:14,602
Our

386
00:22:14,602 --> 00:22:17,417
Lives are ebbing away out of grief,

387
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:22,655
And people are coming here to congratulate us.

388
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:27,267
Mr Paracha had come.

389
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,243
He was talking

390
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:32,484
To me with such visible fear as if

391
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:37,705
He's talking to the Law Minister's Dad.

392
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:44,221
He handed me a slip for a tithe, saying,

393
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:47,235
'Give this to Afzal Bhai'.

394
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:52,043
Someone's demanded 200,000 from his wastrels of sons.

395
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:56,738
Now your habile lad's PA

396
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:58,205
Is going to make

397
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:00,568
A phonecall to the cove,

398
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:04,162
And he'll be saying back, 'I'm sorry',

399
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:06,870
'Afzal Bhai, but I didn't know'

400
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,493
'That Haroon and Mamoon were your servitors'.

401
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:15,327
Haroon and Mamoon are Mr Paracha's wastrels of sons.

402
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,579
May I ask something, Molvi Sahab?

403
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:18,448
Why,

404
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,569
Sure!

405
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,892
Ask me ten if you want.

406
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:27,450
Don't you feel afraid?

407
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:31,664
If you run a bulletin of exaggerated news stories like a TV channel,

408
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:35,689
Won't it strike fear in my heart?

409
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:42,060
And when one's heart is fearstricken, Molvi Sahab,

410
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,012
Doctors' visits and medicines don't help.

411
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:51,523
You always look for negative meanings to positive things.

412
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,514
Our son

413
00:23:53,514 --> 00:24:00,483
Has sprouted wings and touched the fastigium of prosperity!

414
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:04,826
And you're sitting here like a cowardly mother, wailing,

415
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:06,435
'Watch out', 'Beware',

416
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:08,280
'He may slip and fall'.

417
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,191
Someone's congratulated us!

418
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:13,230
Say it jovially,

419
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,808
'Blessed be he'.

420
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,090
Did you say it?

421
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,660
'Blessed be he'?

422
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,889
Say it, will you, Molvi Sahab.

423
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:35,641
Our son's sprouted wings and touched the fastigium of prosperity,

424
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:41,136
And you're watching from the bottom like the austere yet inspiriting father,

425
00:24:41,136 --> 00:24:44,110
That his ladder's standing on thin air.

426
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,270
I've always held fast to the ladder.

427
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,820
I can't even say,

428
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,656
'Watch out', 'Be careful'...

429
00:24:55,656 --> 00:25:01,534
The abyss lies ahead and it's a long way down behind.

430
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,699
Alas...

431
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,811
A mother's no soldier, Dad,

432
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:20,811
Whose resolve would strengthen with every blow.

433
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,812
One of them may prove fatal, too.

434
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:31,591
Then tell her not to live half-dead.

435
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:33,568
Show me her strength,

436
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:37,955
Or I will keep on delivering blows like this.

437
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,678
She's --

438
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:45,327
Lying on the bed all the time.

439
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:49,097
It kills me to see that...

440
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,505
I don't stop her from weeping and tormenting,

441
00:25:55,505 --> 00:25:58,593
But is this even a way?

442
00:25:58,593 --> 00:26:02,744
Tell her to get up and move about here.

443
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:08,901
If nothing else, she could at least pick a fight with me!

444
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,229
Arifa!

445
00:26:10,229 --> 00:26:12,130
Yes, Mum?

446
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,262
Yes, Mum?

447
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:23,620
Why does the sound of my voice frighten you like that?

448
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,650
Call her.

449
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,300
Whom?

450
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,080
The one who comes here when she's tormented, but never even shows up

451
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,650
When I'm tormented.

452
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,395
Farah?

453
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,334
Farah's the one...

454
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:41,481
The one who wrote the letters,

455
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:44,848
And the one who does not.

456
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,892
Call her here.

457
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:53,510
Tell her there's neither the tiger in the fields, nor the hunter on the tree stand;

458
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,998
She can come now.

459
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,653
So pleasantly will time pass when two so crazed shall meet...

460
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,284
No...

461
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:07,006
What's there to say 'no' about?

462
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:10,363
It benefits both of us when she comes.

463
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,434
I'd bless her,

464
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:15,863
And she'd heal me.

465
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:19,836
Just the sound of her voice

466
00:27:19,836 --> 00:27:23,002
Eases my heart.

467
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,410
Why do you think that a psychiatrist can't fall in love?

468
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,468
Remember, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

469
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:42,531
Every lover is a psychiatrist.

470
00:27:43,103 --> 00:27:45,405
He becomes both the patient and the healer.

471
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:47,859
Remember, also, that no one

472
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:50,144
Can understand your state of mind better than me.

473
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,143
Why have you come here without Mum and Dad's permission?

474
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:56,875
I'll answer that at the end of our little conversation.

475
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,083
For now,

476
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:02,312
Just look deeply into my eyes.

477
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:05,046
What do I look for in there?

478
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,621
Hey!

479
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,603
Do you think I'm so shameless?

480
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:11,853
Strange...

481
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:14,712
You're terming treatment as shamelessness!

482
00:28:14,712 --> 00:28:16,779
Treatment?

483
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:19,231
So you've come here to treat me?

484
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:19,989
Lubna!

485
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,379
Why are you calling Lubna?

486
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,141
It was a slip of the tongue!

487
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:23,532
And --

488
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:25,184
I'm always talking about treatment --

489
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:28,434
So I called this meeting a treatment...

490
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,843
By the way, you could've also taken it that I'm giving a signal of sorts.

491
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,564
What kind of signal?

492
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:43,111
Just think that a meeting's called 'treatment',

493
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:48,521
Let's decide secret words for going for a ride and going to the pictures, too, shall we?

494
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:49,400
Exempli gratia,

495
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,119
The signal for going to the pictures could be 'operation'...

496
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,228
So, say

497
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,760
You receive an SMS at 6 p.m.

498
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,841
'Operation'.

499
00:28:56,841 --> 00:29:00,348
Take it that I've got two film tickets in my pocket.

500
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,871
You're a proper blighter, I give you that!

501
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:04,143
No problem.

502
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:06,351
What 'no problem'?

503
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:10,225
As I'd told you the other day, it happens in my profession.

504
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:12,246
People even insult my mother and sister.

505
00:29:12,246 --> 00:29:13,467
I don't mind it.

506
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,747
I'd better leave!

507
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:16,091
Don't you dare!

508
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,269
What'd you just say?

509
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:18,613
I said 'Don't you dare'!

510
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,238
Sit.

511
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,504
Sit!

512
00:29:22,504 --> 00:29:24,576
Sit tight here and listen to me.

513
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,167
Don't get up.

514
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,506
I want to

515
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:32,807
Talk to you about Afzal.

516
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,772
What do you want to talk about him?

517
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,710
He's no longer the kind of malady a psychiatrist can treat.

518
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,540
He's become an ace 'Bhai' [hoodlum, lit. brother].

519
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,347
So what?

520
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:51,130
I've treated many such 'Bhais' who've now become oul fellas.

521
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,082
Have you heard of Harshad Murgi [lit. hen]?

522
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:58,224
He was an infamous racketeer of Hyderabad.

523
00:29:58,224 --> 00:30:00,235
Came to me for his treatment.

524
00:30:00,235 --> 00:30:02,862
I had him sit like a rooster on the first day.

525
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:05,179
I thought I'd start with fixing the nyaff's gender.

526
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:07,203
Know what, he got married right after getting cured.

527
00:30:07,203 --> 00:30:08,828
By the Lord's grace, he's got two young'uns now.

528
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:11,718
He sells hens near the police station.

529
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:13,029
I saw him the other day,

530
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:18,350
And he said, 'I can tell, now, by its gait whether it's a rooster or a hen'.

531
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,514
But why are we talking about Harshad Murgi?

532
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:24,124
Because you wanted to talk about Afzal.

533
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:25,837
The poor soul...

534
00:30:25,837 --> 00:30:28,229
I've heard he was a nice and honourable kind of lad.

535
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,961
He'd even quit gambling and started praying.

536
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,211
But who knows

537
00:30:32,211 --> 00:30:36,024
Why he left Hyderabad for Karachi...

538
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:38,327
Because of me.

539
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:39,672
I think

540
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,970
He's left because of me.

541
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,805
I'd told you this one, too!

542
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:46,581
What does it matter if you'd told?

543
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,129
You tell me anything and everything that you can utter.

544
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:52,240
But you keep your heart's secrets locked deep in your heart.

545
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,874
He'd have fallen in love...

546
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:55,646
I'd told you about that, too.

547
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,254
Another girl named Farah used to write him letters.

548
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,357
He loved just her.

549
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:03,171
Who knows how many he loves now...

550
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:07,256
That's the real problem with you.

551
00:31:08,087 --> 00:31:09,758
What's my problem?

552
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:11,580
What's the problem with me?

553
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,231
No, not yours -- it's his problem...

554
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:17,705
The thing is, if he'd just mustered the courage to say it once,

555
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:20,112
'To the dickens with the Farah who writes letters',

556
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:22,389
'I love you',

557
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,030
He wouldn't have had to see this time in Karachi today.

558
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,311
What?

559
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,503
Did the blighter have so much courage to come to me and say,

560
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,433
'I love you'?

561
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,365
Wouldn't I have broken his face?

562
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:34,373
I'm sure you would have;

563
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:38,012
Aye, you'd be busy mending it afterwards.

564
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:41,115
And to be honest,

565
00:31:41,115 --> 00:31:44,035
You did break his face, which made him leave,

566
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,776
And you're busy putting it together.

567
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,552
But you don't know, Mlle Farah Ibrahim,

568
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:59,092
They say a gentleman's face, when broken, can be mended,

569
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:01,827
But not the honour that shattered with it.

570
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,835
See you.

571
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,485
Yes, Arifa,

572
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,815
Tell me,

573
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:46,040
Is everything alright?

574
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,226
We need your help.

575
00:32:49,226 --> 00:32:50,772
Please, tell me.

576
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:53,511
What do you need?

577
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:56,908
We need you, Farah...

578
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:03,350
Mum's found a cure for her condition,

579
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,177
And she's come up with your name as a home remedy.

580
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:08,601
I don't get it...

581
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:11,554
How do I explain it to you...

582
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:15,253
Mum needs Afzal to live.

583
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:18,082
But he can't come now.

584
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:21,302
When you come, Mum feels

585
00:33:21,302 --> 00:33:25,471
As if Afzal's here.

586
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,481
Hey!

587
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,493
Shouldn't you be in Clifton?

588
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,218
I should've been at home.

589
00:33:57,218 --> 00:34:00,763
The new chef asked for my help to cook.

590
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,690
New chef?

591
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,963
What happened to the old one?

592
00:34:05,963 --> 00:34:08,047
He'd just serve the plates.

593
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,228
What's this guff, mate?

594
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:15,687
How could you hire any Tom, Dick, or Harry as a new chef without asking me?

595
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,792
This isn't Hyderabad, Sajid,

596
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,174
It's Karachi.

597
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,327
Sit.

598
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,525
Sit down here.

599
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,217
Here.

600
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:15,291
Look at these.

601
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,734
Don't look at me; look at these photographs.

602
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:23,745
Look at each one of these, then ask me who all of these are.

603
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:26,621
Who are all of these?

604
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:34,087
I've murdered all of these one by one.

605
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:43,989
This game of murdering and killing is so fierce that it doesn't end until the killer is dead!

606
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,147
There's opulence to be seen,

607
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,479
I live in this mansion

608
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,833
Like an Emperor,

609
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:57,720
And the police salute me like my humble subjects when I go out,

610
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,680
I have hundreds of millions of Rupees,

611
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,982
But not a moment's assurance that I can live in peace.

612
00:36:08,164 --> 00:36:11,626
You're a very sweet and delicate girl,

613
00:36:11,626 --> 00:36:16,357
And your dreams are even more delicate than you are.

614
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,737
But I'm the kind who'd shatter glass utensils at the slightest provocation,

615
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:24,678
Whatever could I do with your dreams?

616
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,691
What's the real story?

617
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:29,395
I just told you.

618
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,869
No.

619
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,423
The real story is that you don't like me.

620
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:34,924
From our starting quarrels,

621
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:37,585
You thought that Yasmin's very insolent.

622
00:36:37,585 --> 00:36:42,119
Although I'm not insolent at all.

623
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,949
Do you love me?

624
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,787
When did I say that?

625
00:36:52,787 --> 00:36:56,145
I thought that you love me but are just a bit afraid to tell me.

626
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,143
Don't be afraid.

627
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:00,609
There's quite a bit of frankness between the two of us, now.

628
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,518
Just say it.

629
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,560
Why are you so afraid, boyo?

630
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,341
What's the worst that can happen?

631
00:37:12,341 --> 00:37:15,482
I'd scold you.

632
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,497
It's late in the evening.

633
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:19,803
This is the perfect time for these things.

634
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:23,426
Such things sound bland in broad daylight.

635
00:37:23,426 --> 00:37:24,993
Get in the car.

636
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,130
Would you take me for a ride?

637
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:29,257
I'd drop you home.

638
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:30,371
Why?

639
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:31,425
Do you have a problem?

640
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:33,099
What'd your Mum be thinking?

641
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,926
She trusts you completely.

642
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,427
I wasn't even coming here,

643
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:39,981
But she insisted that I go and see what you've been up to.

644
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:43,401
So, have you found out what I've been up to?
-Don't change the topic.

645
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:47,179
When the thing about love does come up, you say just half of it, and hold the rest of it back.

646
00:37:47,179 --> 00:37:52,169
Finish the line, and you can drop me home after that if you like.

647
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,913
You don't know, Yasmin, you're a very good girl, but --
-Now, you'd better not say that you like me!

648
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:04,550
Your grammar fails at the most crucial moment.

649
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,096
Are you feeling shy now?

650
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:08,094
Alright, I'll look the other way.

651
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,393
There.

652
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:10,895
Now, say the full thing,

653
00:38:10,895 --> 00:38:14,282
And don't fumble with your grammar.

654
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,930
I don't love you, Yasmin,

655
00:38:39,412 --> 00:38:46,076
And I'm not worthy of being loved, now, either.

656
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,550
Drop me at my place.

657
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
