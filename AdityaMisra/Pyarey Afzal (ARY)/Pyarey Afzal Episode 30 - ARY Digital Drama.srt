1
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:13,803
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:18,995
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:24,109
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:30,495
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:36,060
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,694
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:55,968
Sitting here like this,

8
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,401
Staring at the roof and the walls,

9
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,842
Tell me,

10
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,644
Are you on the verge of a new discovery,

11
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:05,612
Or are you intent on destroying everything?

12
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,255
Sit tight.

13
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:09,875
Put this down before her.

14
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,887
What's this?

15
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:21,853
This is your gown for the engagement,

16
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,391
And here's the diamond ring

17
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:25,604
They'll put on you the day after tomorrow.

18
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,821
The day after tomorrow?

19
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,533
Don't argue over the day after tomorrow.

20
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,625
Just think it's the date of an exam -

21
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,609
Once it's been fixed, it's been fixed.

22
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:40,266
Why are you looking at Mum?

23
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,536
Look at the ring.

24
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,969
Isn't it lovely?

25
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:49,862
At least you could've asked me once before fixing the date.

26
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:53,257
Are you talking to Lubna, or to me?

27
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,070
To you, of course, Mum.

28
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,225
Then you're a right daring lass.

29
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,557
Just because I've come to show you the gown and the ring,

30
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:02,247
Don't think I'm asking you,

31
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:03,882
'Do you like the gown'?

32
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:06,416
'Do you like the ring'?

33
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,949
It's just that Sibtain's father wished that it be shown to you;

34
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:12,538
That's why the engagement gown is from him.

35
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:13,189
Come.

36
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:14,537
Take everything, Lubna,

37
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:17,994
And take it that she likes it.

38
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,341
If the engagement's on the day after tomorrow,

39
00:03:20,341 --> 00:03:23,037
Tell them it won't be.

40
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,208
Tell whom?

41
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,857
Sibtain's father?

42
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,934
Should I tell him that daughters here

43
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,213
Order their parents around?

44
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,662
Hold your horses, you barmy lass,

45
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:37,405
Or every slap I've held back all my life

46
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:40,847
Will grace your face now.

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,682
Come.

48
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,232
At least ask me, Mum,

49
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:51,200
Why I'm saying the engagement can't be on the day after tomorrow?

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,370
Right, what is it the day after tomorrow?

51
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,726
Won't you invite Afzal's Mum?

52
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:58,190
I'm going over to her once I'm through with you.

53
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,864
How bad is it, Mum!

54
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,724
She's so ill she's bedridden,

55
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,948
And you'd go and tell her, 'My daughter's getting engaged the day after tomorrow'?

56
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:08,064
Even if Molvi Sahab alone is in attendance, it'll be enough.

57
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,644
Although I'll ask him

58
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,892
To bring Arifa along too.

59
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,395
How would she come?

60
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,162
She's not going to leave her sick mother --

61
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,007
And come.

62
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,392
Why are you suddenly feeling for her sick mother now?

63
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:23,495
First, you calumnied her son and ousted him from Hyderabad,

64
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,910
And because of you, he became a hoodlum over there,

65
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,467
And that is what has made her fall ill,

66
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:32,559
And you, sitting here, are playing her nurse?

67
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,211
His Mum's 'Mother Teresa'!

68
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,257
Don't you dare

69
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:39,427
Ruin the engagement on the pretext of his mother!

70
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:40,636
What was destined to happen to her

71
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:41,493
Has already happened.

72
00:04:41,493 --> 00:04:44,453
Your intensive care isn't going to heal her.

73
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,174
Come.

74
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,181
Mum!

75
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,637
I don't like this ring, that's it!

76
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,229
Splendid.

77
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,267
You don't like a ring that costs 170,000 Rupees?

78
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,219
What would you like?

79
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:58,599
Tell them, will you,

80
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,533
That I'll get the ring I like.

81
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,260
It won't be too expensive.

82
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
If I agree to this demand,

83
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,403
You won't create a scene on the day of the engagement, would you?

84
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:08,519
I swear by you, I won't.

85
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,852
Not at all.

86
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:14,177
I'd even agree to the day after tomorrow.

87
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,202
Alright, then,

88
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,868
Get the ring you like.

89
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,948
May I ask about a problem, Molvi Sahab?

90
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:15,893
Begin in the Lord's name.

91
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:20,650
You've pronounced it forbidden

92
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,425
To meet him and be in his company,

93
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:29,811
But is it forbidden to look at him from afar, too?

94
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:41,340
I've gotten my answer.

95
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:47,199
How come you've gotten the answer

96
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,966
When I don't have one either?

97
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:56,598
Perhaps it's not forbidden,

98
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,467
But remember, Ruqaiyya Begum,

99
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:05,646
One look at him

100
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:11,568
Would forbid any calm from setting in in your life.

101
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,156
Then, this illusion of seeing the doctor,

102
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,644
These

103
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,329
Excuses of medicines,

104
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,220
None of this would work, either.

105
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,068
But I'm only talking about looking at him from afar, Molvi Sahab!

106
00:07:27,068 --> 00:07:28,168
Just like --

107
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:30,571
I look at his photograph.

108
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:33,844
Does that torment me?

109
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:38,010
Why are you laughing?

110
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,992
I used to think

111
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:46,038
Who the blighter's taken after!

112
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,501
I've realised today

113
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,729
That he's taken after you.

114
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:56,208
Do you remember,

115
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:59,523
How he said one day,

116
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:04,092
'I've started down God's path, Dad'.

117
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:07,481
Would you see, now,

118
00:08:07,481 --> 00:08:11,609
Where the path of God lies,

119
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:15,115
And where the wretch is!

120
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:18,852
And it's the same with you -

121
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,369
I check your pulse,

122
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,871
Give you medicines,

123
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,181
Give you courage,

124
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:32,365
So you can walk down the path of Molvi Subhanallah's wife.

125
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:35,375
But the moment you get a chance,

126
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,325
You start treading down the mother's path!

127
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:47,947
Don't let a single teardrop fall, Ruqaiyya Begum,

128
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:52,953
Or I'll leave you with him.

129
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,753
Why don't you get her married, Aunt?

130
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,769
She won't get married now.

131
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,419
She's started teaching the kids.

132
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:33,720
So, what's with teaching the kids?

133
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,154
She's devoted herself to it.

134
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:39,146
She says, 'Once you've devoted yourself to something',

135
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,238
'You remain steadfast in your devotion'.

136
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,299
That's not right at all, Aunt.

137
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,604
I mean --

138
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:47,163
What kind of a reply is this?

139
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,614
The question ain't right either, is it?

140
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,296
I mean,

141
00:09:52,296 --> 00:09:54,900
Who are you to ask this?

142
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,853
Have I ever said that you should get married?

143
00:09:56,853 --> 00:10:00,170
Or has Mam ever said so?

144
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,813
Don't look at my face,

145
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,324
Have your meal, and just think that teaching the kids

146
00:10:04,324 --> 00:10:05,734
Is a far greater challenge than getting married,

147
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:08,617
And I always choose the more challenging job.

148
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:10,787
Is teaching children a job to you?

149
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:12,290
Put a sock in it!

150
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,793
Even a husband like Salim wouldn't pester one as much as the kids do!

151
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:18,351
One's got a finger inside his nose, another's got an itch in his underarm.

152
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,017
And when I asked one to recite his lesson, it turned out he was sleeping!

153
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,489
And one lad's a proper royal -

154
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,404
He asks, 'Miss',

155
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:25,388
'Why does 9 + 9 equal 18'?

156
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:28,162
'Why not 19'?

157
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,069
Pray tell,

158
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:31,727
Why not 19?

159
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,494
You tell me that.

160
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:37,713
I just know it's 18.

161
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,760
Arifa, my dear, would you see who's there?

162
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:58,944
Peace be upon you, Molvi Uncle.

163
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:02,488
And upon you, peace, my dear.

164
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:09,155
What are you doing?

165
00:11:09,598 --> 00:11:12,232
I'm preparing a medicine

166
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:15,503
To give strength to the heart.

167
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:19,052
I'd mix it with some honey and take this,

168
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:22,885
And give some to her, too.

169
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,026
Peace be upon you!

170
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:46,638
Hey!

171
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,319
And upon you, peace.

172
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,946
It seems you'd not rest before I'm alright.

173
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:55,367
You come here everyday.

174
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,707
Sit.
-Alright.

175
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,694
Is this noise of grinding something coming from somewhere in our home?

176
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,259
Yes.

177
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:10,917
Molvi Uncle's preparing a medicine to give strength to the heart.

178
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,970
He'd give you some today!

179
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,998
That's what I feared.

180
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,779
He'd turn into a medic if he gave up his priesthood.

181
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,666
He'd given me an elixir after our marriage.

182
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,797
I used to have headaches in half my head.

183
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:32,834
That headache never affected just half my head ever again.

184
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:36,166
Are you waiting for my orders to get tea?

185
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,949
I won't have any tea.

186
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,591
I've not even come to look after you today.

187
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,334
I'd like to ask for a favour.

188
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,528
Pray tell.

189
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:48,736
I'm getting engaged on the day after tomorrow.

190
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:56,041
They'd sent a ring,

191
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,078
As in, they want me to see it and say that I like it.

192
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,411
But I didn't like it.

193
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,114
It must be a gold ring...

194
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,155
No,

195
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,981
It's a diamong ring.

196
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:10,942
But I didn't like it.

197
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,615
Why not?

198
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:16,428
Hey!

199
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,350
Sit down, will you?

200
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,195
If you keep standing like that, it feels

201
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,000
As if you'd refuse if I asked you for anything.
-Hey!

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,041
Who could ever refuse you anything here?

203
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,563
Ask for whatever you want without any hesitation.

204
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,749
I want the ring, Aunt,

205
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:36,189
That Molvi Uncle had had made for me.

206
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,655
Oh, that inexpensive ring -- what would you do with that?

207
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:48,880
And never wear that accursed ring on an auspicious day.

208
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,743
I'd have thrown it away

209
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:54,417
Had the wretched thing not been made of gold!

210
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,881
I'd only wear that ring, Aunt.

211
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:58,803
If I wore any other,

212
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,725
It'd gnaw at my finger every moment.

213
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:04,337
You're not getting that ring, Farah.

214
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,194
It's a memory of the day that led us to these.

215
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:13,697
And Mum's reasoning is true, too -

216
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:17,479
One doesn't wear such accursed things on an auspicious day.

217
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:21,462
I want the same ring, Aunt.

218
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,930
I beg you.

219
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,811
This isn't proper, Farah.

220
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:35,934
You're resolute to get something you'd so resolutely refused.

221
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:38,383
And whom are you asking?

222
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,793
Dad took it out of his pocket and threw it away the moment he entered,

223
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:45,932
And Mum never saw it again.

224
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,549
I have it with me.

225
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:56,351
I look at it whenever I feel sadness at my brother's fate.

226
00:14:56,351 --> 00:14:58,413
So, forgive me,

227
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:02,895
But you're never going to get that ring.

228
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:21,045
Here, my dear, have your favourite coconut biscuits.

229
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,496
I'd promised you yesterday, hadn't I?

230
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,885
But she's left!

231
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,957
What happened to her?

232
00:15:35,957 --> 00:15:39,832
She'd come to get the ring we'd had made for Afzal's engagement.

233
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,103
Why?

234
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:44,978
She's getting engaged the day after tomorrow.

235
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:50,418
She says she'd only wear that ring on her engagement.

236
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,511
Where's the ring?

237
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,422
Arifa has it safely with her.

238
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:02,552
Then, tell Arifa to give it to her.

239
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:06,396
She's left weeping at such a trifle!

240
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:09,954
Why don't you talk to Arifa?

241
00:16:09,954 --> 00:16:14,217
She's left me speechless.

242
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,447
Hey!

243
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:36,230
What would you say the next time you come?

244
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,239
You didn't get it, did you?

245
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,801
You said when you met me yesterday, 'I don't love you',

246
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,367
Today, you said,

247
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,668
'I love someone else',

248
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:50,660
So, tell me as you're leaving,

249
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,707
What would you say when you come tomorrow?

250
00:16:54,707 --> 00:16:57,015
Why not say everything at once,

251
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,733
And check

252
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,500
How much of it Yasmin can take?

253
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:07,370
I won't be coming now, Yasmin.

254
00:17:09,676 --> 00:17:11,040
There!

255
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,248
You've learnt new ways to kill ever since you started murdering people.

256
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:18,449
Go and note it down, now,

257
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,839
That you killed one Yasmin, too, today.

258
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,889
This isn't proper, Farah.

259
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:42,346
You're resolute to get something you'd so resolutely refused.

260
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:44,944
And whom are you asking?

261
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:48,348
Dad took it out of his pocket and threw it away the moment he entered,

262
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:52,058
And Mum never saw it again.

263
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:55,902
I have it with me.

264
00:18:55,902 --> 00:19:00,617
I look at it whenever I feel sadness at my brother's fate.

265
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,737
So, forgive me,

266
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:06,689
But you're never going to get that ring.

267
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:09,447
Show me where it is!

268
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:11,387
Show you what?

269
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:15,970
The ring you like, of course!

270
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,543
You didn't get it?

271
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,283
Didn't you like it?

272
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,918
No, it's not like that.

273
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:28,290
I liked that ring.

274
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,408
Why did you leave it, then?

275
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:32,891
They didn't give it to me.

276
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,891
Oh...

277
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:43,244
Arifa must've refused.

278
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:46,499
How do you know where I'd gone to get the ring?

279
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,467
Did Arifa call you?

280
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,862
Not at all.

281
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:52,389
I found out from my experience.

282
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,892
The thing is,

283
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,984
One girl in love

284
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:59,983
Knows another inside out!

285
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:02,154
I knew it the very moment

286
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:07,594
You'd kicked away a ring that cost 170,000 Rupees!

287
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,150
Mum had said it clearly,

288
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,065
'This isn't about liking',

289
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,707
'But about devotion'.

290
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:25,333
But why do you have such a devoted attachment to that ring?

291
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:27,748
Well,

292
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,608
Time's running out.

293
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,219
The day after tomorrow is just around the corner,

294
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:34,443
And you're bothered about a ring that isn't even yours!

295
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,365
How come it isn't mine?

296
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,221
Surely, it is mine.

297
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:56,426
Now, I can't say that the ring is yours...

298
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,736
But, surely,

299
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,859
It isn't an outsider's.

300
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,982
Why don't you go to her?

301
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,563
As in, to Arifa?

302
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,292
Yes.

303
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,996
She's your best friend.

304
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,507
She won't refuse if you ask her.

305
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:10,747
Why, mate?

306
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:15,351
Why should I get for you something that is rightfully mine?

307
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:21,685
It's obvious

308
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:24,955
They've still kept it with them for an auspicious purpose.

309
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:27,807
Why would they put it around someone else's bride?

310
00:21:27,807 --> 00:21:29,434
Tell Mum, then,

311
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:31,620
This engagement can't go forward.

312
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,496
I'd already said so

313
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,836
When you dashed upstairs, stupefied,

314
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,931
I told Mum right then,

315
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,649
That she couldn't get the ring,

316
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:42,959
And I'd even told her that the engagement can't go forward now.

317
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,290
Then?

318
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,341
What, 'then'?

319
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:47,388
Mum said,

320
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:52,921
'In that case, she'd be getting married the day after tomorrow'.

321
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,430
Look, Farah,

322
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,065
Please, show that you're wise,

323
00:22:03,065 --> 00:22:05,513
The circumstances are not in your favour.

324
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:08,121
And when Afzal's out of the picture for you anyhow,

325
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,938
What would you do, wearing his ring?

326
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,581
I'd say

327
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,433
That you don't test your would-be husband's sense of honour.

328
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,827
Look,

329
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,346
Get me the ring.

330
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:23,574
You may have Afzal if you want.

331
00:22:24,901 --> 00:22:26,761
What?

332
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,860
Think carefully, Farah,

333
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,902
You're offering me more than you can dare to.

334
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:37,156
I think Molvi Sahab's sobs have struck me.

335
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,496
If I wore the same ring on my engagement,

336
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:41,744
It'd ease this burden on me.

337
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:43,432
If Afzal's taken a liking to you,

338
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,076
He's all yours from now on,

339
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:49,610
But even today, the ring is mine.

340
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,954
She's teaching the kids these days.

341
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:21,147
She says it's a far greater challenge than getting married.

342
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:24,759
One's got a finger inside his nose, another's got an itch in his underarm.

343
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,130
And when she asked one to recite his lesson, he was sleeping.

344
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,742
And one lad's a proper royal -

345
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:29,967
He asks, 'Miss',

346
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,170
'Why does 9 + 9'

347
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,934
'Equal 18'?

348
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,569
'Why not 19'?

349
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,224
The kid asked her that one?

350
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:41,289
Yes, he asked her.

351
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,681
You're mad.

352
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:45,765
She was asking you this one.

353
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:48,284
Look,

354
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:52,053
'9 + 9' means 'Afzal + the one who writes him letters',

355
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:54,330
Which would add up to 18.

356
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,290
But when you can never get the one who writes you letters,

357
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,290
Why can't 9 + 9

358
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,894
Equal 19?

359
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,746
And 19 means

360
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:07,051
'Afzal + Yasmin'.

361
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:09,287
You've been failing Maths all your life,

362
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:13,087
And now, you're telling me that 9 + 9 equals 19?

363
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,440
So does that mean that because I don't love her,

364
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,843
9 + 9 can't equal 19?

365
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,687
More than half the marriages in our country follow this formula.

366
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:25,034
Only in textbooks does 9 + 9 equal 18.

367
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,150
Practically,

368
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,514
It's always either 19 or 17.

369
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,799
Anyway,

370
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,736
Tell me,

371
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:36,107
Why did you go there?

372
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:42,021
Why did you go there when you'd told her yesterday that you don't love her?

373
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:44,423
Just went there.

374
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:50,490
I thought I'd just as well tell her that I love someone else.

375
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,109
Why are you laughing?

376
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:56,194
You could start sitting with the kids she teaches,

377
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,983
With your finger in your nose one moment, itching your underarm another; and when asked to recite the lesson, just sleeping peacefully.

378
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:03,109
But please don't tell such a blatant lie.

379
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,124
It's not a lie, Babloo.

380
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:06,950
I have proof.

381
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,771
I've told her that I'm never coming back.

382
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:11,708
I agree that she's very nice,

383
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:14,018
And loves me a lot.

384
00:25:14,018 --> 00:25:17,272
It must've really hurt her to hear that I love someone else,

385
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:19,830
But what could I do, Babloo?

386
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,712
She's treading down the same path as I am,

387
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:24,820
And she, too, would find nothing down it.

388
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,563
You sound wicked when you say that, Afzal.

389
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:35,545
It sounds like the owner of a river pitying the thirsty but not giving him a drop.

390
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:39,594
May God forgive you for being such a miser.

391
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:16,786
I'd told you

392
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:19,421
She'd be sitting on the swing.

393
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:25,110
You're here again?

394
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:27,202
Why do you drop in so suddenly?

395
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,264
At least leave me alone for two days.

396
00:26:29,264 --> 00:26:30,845
Finished yet?

397
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:34,813
Sit on the swing and listen to me calmly.

398
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,719
There's insolence in my profession, but not disgraceful shamelessness!

399
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,470
What do you mean?

400
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,268
I've heard everything about your drama.

401
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:47,911
I wasn't even willing to come,

402
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,430
But then I thought I'd see for myself what you're made of!

403
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,887
Watch your words there!

404
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,700
How dare you!

405
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,615
Hey!

406
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,196
Get him out of my sights!

407
00:26:56,196 --> 00:26:59,841
Look at how he's bossing over me!

408
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,556
I haven't even started bossing over you!

409
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,163
I'll tell you when you get to my place!

410
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:09,819
And don't you dare talk about me so rudely.

411
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,491
I'm not the kind

412
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,599
Who'd mistake such discourtesies as affection!

413
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,630
It is pure insolence to me.

414
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:21,561
Lubna!

415
00:27:21,561 --> 00:27:22,584
Lubna!

416
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,749
Why are you calling Lubna? Talk to me.

417
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:27,219
What's this

418
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:29,807
Engagement ring drama you've started?

419
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:32,287
I didn't like your ring.

420
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:36,782
You didn't like a ring worth 170,000 Rupees.

421
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:37,420
So,

422
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,331
Please show me the one you like.

423
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,109
I will

424
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:42,520
When I get it.

425
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,170
Where'd you get it from?

426
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,045
I know about that, too.

427
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:52,749
So such rings would be used on the occasion of the wedding of a psychiatrist like myself as those whose sanctity is dubious!

428
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,128
Pray tell, also, how much that ring costs.

429
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:57,911
More than the price,

430
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,608
Think about how much I like that ring.

431
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:03,918
You're rather dubious, too, when it comes to what you like.

432
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,865
Shut up!

433
00:28:05,865 --> 00:28:08,643
Then listen carefully -

434
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:13,092
An engagement isn't destined for that ring.

435
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,345
Put it clearly.

436
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,836
What do you mean?

437
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,143
What do I tell you what it means?

438
00:28:19,143 --> 00:28:21,158
The thing is,

439
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,188
You don't deserve me.

440
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:25,156
I don't deserve you?

441
00:28:25,156 --> 00:28:27,125
Nobody's told you, apparently,

442
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:31,015
Many psychiatrists have sacrificed their love for the sake of their honour.

443
00:28:31,015 --> 00:28:32,689
I'm your doctor,

444
00:28:32,689 --> 00:28:36,006
I know it very well that you're a bit round the twist.

445
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:42,330
You're remembering your old ring today; you might remember your old lover tomorrow.

446
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,898
No.

447
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,367
No chance. Never.

448
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,781
This engagement isn't possible.

449
00:28:47,781 --> 00:28:49,505
My foot!

450
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:52,462
You'll know about 'foot' when your Paw gets the news.

451
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:53,454
Say, then,

452
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:55,934
'My foot'!

453
00:28:57,423 --> 00:29:02,957
If the Lord wills it, your feet would've been chopped off the next time we meet!

454
00:29:26,262 --> 00:29:27,437
Hey!

455
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:29,684
Why are you so furious?

456
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,939
I've just sacrificed my love for the sake of my honour!

457
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:36,442
Please tell me in simpler terms - what have you just done?

458
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,754
I've called the engagement off.

459
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:39,013
What?

460
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,482
I've put it plainly -

461
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:43,411
If that accursed ring is used on the engagement,

462
00:29:43,411 --> 00:29:46,232
I'm not getting engaged.

463
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:52,705
Lubna!

464
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:53,914
Lubna!

465
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:54,847
What is it?

466
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:55,913
Why are you so worked up?

467
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:58,362
The engagement's broken...

468
00:29:58,362 --> 00:29:59,989
He's found out about everything, hasn't he?

469
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,493
He was shivering out of disgrace.

470
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:04,670
But however did he find out?

471
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:10,347
Who could've told him but you?

472
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,126
You?

473
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,249
Hadn't you told him?

474
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:17,333
Don't you remember when you'd gone to him for your treatment?

475
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:20,935
You'd narrated the entire story about Afzal over the three hours you sat with him.

476
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:22,888
That's right...

477
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,220
You must've told him then about the incident with the ring, too.

478
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,628
It's possible...

479
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:33,309
But who told him that I'm going to wear the same ring on the engagement?

480
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,518
I did.

481
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,273
I just uttered it...

482
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:40,256
What it is is I don't like to lie to someone so close.

483
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,322
There!

484
00:30:41,322 --> 00:30:42,717
You're not a sister, Lubna Ibrahim,

485
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:44,438
You're a snake

486
00:30:44,438 --> 00:30:46,499
That's been biting me ever since!

487
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:48,747
You're such a thankless girl!

488
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,096
You forgot in one moment

489
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:52,461
Everything I've sacrificed for you!

490
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:54,569
I've told the truth and lied for you,

491
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:56,495
Taken slaps and scolding,

492
00:30:56,495 --> 00:30:59,749
And you're saying today that I'm a snake?

493
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:00,542
Alright.

494
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,099
If I'm a snake to you,

495
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,646
Stay away from me!

496
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,035
Call him!

497
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:09,624
I asked you to call him right now!

498
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:11,685
And tell him

499
00:31:11,685 --> 00:31:13,948
That I've agreed.

500
00:31:14,598 --> 00:31:16,892
'Agreed', as in?

501
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:20,736
Tell him I'd wear his diamond ring on my engagement.

502
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:22,085
He shouldn't break the engagement,

503
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:25,836
Or Dad would kill me for real.

504
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:27,618
Do you know what he'd said?

505
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:30,005
He said I'm 'a bit round the twist'!

506
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:34,639
'You're remembering your old ring today; you might remember your old lover tomorrow'.

507
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,468
Go and tell him

508
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,320
I'm not the type.

509
00:32:19,011 --> 00:32:22,064
You said when you met me yesterday, 'I don't love you',

510
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:23,677
Today, you told,

511
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:26,900
'I love someone else',

512
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,876
So, tell me as you're leaving,

513
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,880
What would you say when you come tomorrow?

514
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,233
Why not say everything at once,

515
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,860
And check

516
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,821
How much of it Yasmin can take?

517
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:40,696
I won't be coming now, Yasmin.

518
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:42,107
There!

519
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:47,268
You've learnt new ways to kill ever since you started murdering people.

520
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,547
Go and note it down, now,

521
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:54,259
That you killed one Yasmin, too, today.

522
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:31,380
Yasmin!

523
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,960
Yasmin!

524
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,262
Wake up! It's almost the afternoon!

525
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,082
Didn't the kids come?

526
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:40,539
They won't be coming today.

527
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:41,968
It's Sunday.

528
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:45,034
You'd said it yourself that Sunday's a holiday.

529
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:46,041
There.

530
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,594
Why had I said that?

531
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:51,977
Is this a school that'd have an off on Sundays?

532
00:34:20,554 --> 00:34:29,265
I don't love you, Yasmin,

533
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:34,533
And I'm not worthy of being loved, now, either.

534
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:43,984
Drop me at my place.

535
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,255
The kid asked her that one?

536
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,347
Yes, he asked her.

537
00:34:51,347 --> 00:34:52,715
You're mad.

538
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:56,121
She was asking you this one.

539
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,392
Look,

540
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:02,078
'9 + 9' means 'Afzal + the one who writes him letters',

541
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,434
Which would add up to 18.

542
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:07,347
But when you can never get the one who writes you letters,

543
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:09,284
Why can't 9 + 9

544
00:35:09,284 --> 00:35:11,857
Equal 19?

545
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,563
And 19 means

546
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:17,297
'Afzal + Yasmin'.

547
00:35:39,856 --> 00:35:41,809
Hey, Alladio!

548
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,111
Where are you off to?

549
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,048
Hyderabad.

550
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,665
Have these four days been enough to satisfy you?

551
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,076
No.

552
00:35:50,076 --> 00:35:51,517
It's not been enough.

553
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:52,959
I've got to go for the engagement.

554
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:55,252
I'll be back in a few days.

555
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,267
You're getting engaged?

556
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,266
I'm not getting engaged, mate.

557
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:00,882
Good old Mlle Farah,

558
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:02,850
The daughter of Monseigneur Ibrahim, the mill owner,

559
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,241
She's getting engaged.

560
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,899
Mum asked me to come.

561
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,186
'Attend the engagement',

562
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:11,686
'And meet me, too'.

563
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,858
May I go, now?

564
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,114
S -- Sure,

565
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:20,129
Go...

566
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,310
Will you get engaged to me?

567
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,187
Why are you laughing?

568
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:27,425
You asked me, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

569
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,765
Why didn't you ask, 'Will you marry me'?

570
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,881
Or is it that you intend to shoo me away at the engagement?
-No way!

571
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:38,036
I accidentally said 'engaged' instead of 'married'.

572
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,020
Mam!

573
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:43,391
Why are you calling your Mum?

574
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,421
You're proposing me for marriage.

575
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,390
I have to discuss with Mam.

576
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,024
Just pray that she accepts it.

577
00:37:50,024 --> 00:37:51,701
You accept it, don't you?

578
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:52,367
Now,

579
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:54,785
I get proposals like this every now and then.

580
00:37:54,785 --> 00:37:58,443
But girls don't decide in a moment.

581
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,814
It takes about a week or so

582
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:02,373
To arrive at a decision.

583
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:04,457
I don't have a week or so.

584
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:07,402
If you accept, we're getting engaged tomorrow.

585
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,200
What if I don't agree to tomorrow?

586
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,842
If you agree to get engaged, why not agree to the date as well?

587
00:38:12,842 --> 00:38:14,331
Just think as if

588
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,752
I'm adamant over it.

589
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,275
So you're adamant over it!

590
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:23,041
You haven't fallen in love with me.

591
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:28,444
Come with me.

592
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:31,312
I'm taking him upstairs.

593
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,342
It's a case of memory loss.

594
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,780
Sit down.

595
00:38:57,804 --> 00:38:59,326
Tell me, now,

596
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:02,779
Whom are you obdurate against?

597
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:10,652
Won't you share what lies in your heart with the one you'd get engaged to?

598
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:14,171
She's getting engaged tomorrow.

599
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:19,448
You're exacting your revenge?

600
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:24,927
She doesn't love you, does she?

601
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:29,763
You don't love me, either.

602
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:35,300
How would I get even with you?

603
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,927
By getting engaged to you?

604
00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:43,857
You thought you'd toy with her with this game of engagements,

605
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:48,171
And please Yasmin, too!

606
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:52,388
You could've just said, 'I need a favour, Yasmin'.

607
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:58,235
You shouldn't have said, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

608
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:01,350
Girls are very sensitive, Afzal,

609
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,183
They'd lose their heart in games such as yours.

610
00:40:04,183 --> 00:40:07,919
Thank goodness I didn't think you'd fallen in love with me.

611
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:09,918
I'm serious, Yasmin.

612
00:40:09,918 --> 00:40:11,669
I've come here with a proposal.

613
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,777
I'm serious, too, Afzal.

614
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:17,900
I reject your proposal.

615
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
