1
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,828
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:18,956
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:24,155
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:30,528
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:36,126
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:40,963
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:01,670
G -- Get this off me, doctor! I --

8
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,148
I'm going to see Mum!

9
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:04,645
You'll go only after you've been unfettered!

10
00:01:04,645 --> 00:01:06,976
For now, lie down!

11
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:08,604
There.

12
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,248
Dad's here.

13
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,632
M -- My heart is sinking.

14
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:15,180
Why is his heart sinking, Doctor?

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,749
It happens with me too at the mention of the police!

16
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:21,507
Peace be upon you, sir.

17
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:22,673
And upon you, peace.

18
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:23,583
Is he alive?

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,500
He is.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,442
Alright, go home,

21
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:26,799
I'll take care of him.

22
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,535
Alright.

23
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:28,603
Once his wound's been dressed,

24
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,477
Give this scarf to the driver and send him to us.

25
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:31,577
Whose is it?

26
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,390
Farah's.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,810
Here.

28
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:51,247
Could he talk?

29
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,491
Easily.

30
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,506
He asked, 'Where am I'?

31
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:55,901
Why did he ask that?

32
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,801
Because he wasn't where he was

33
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,472
Supposed to be when he came to.

34
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,394
He's out of harm's way, isn't he?

35
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:03,231
He is in harm's way.

36
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:05,485
If he slit his wrist properly the next time,

37
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:07,631
He won't be able to talk.

38
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:10,111
You'll just be left remembering him talking.

39
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:12,812
Your love has killed my son!

40
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:13,991
Not at all!

41
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,893
He's alive -- alright.

42
00:02:15,893 --> 00:02:18,250
Have mercy on him!

43
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:20,492
Don't show ingratitude to God

44
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:23,075
By kicking away the lover at your doorstep!

45
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,418
Aunt -- The thing is --

46
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:27,256
I've made a vow...

47
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,176
If he got to Karachi safe and sound,

48
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,902
I'd offer 10 additional prayers.

49
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:39,084
Have some glucose.

50
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,298
It'll comfort your heart.

51
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,889
His heart won't get any comfort

52
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,942
As long as he doesn't get you.

53
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,208
He's here.

54
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,299
That's all it was!

55
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,596
Isn't he here?

56
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:11,113
Dad will bring him along.

57
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:13,607
He's alright, isn't he?

58
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,259
He's alright,

59
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:18,607
But his heart sunk at the sight of Dad!

60
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,960
Listen!

61
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,022
Doesn't it feel exhilarating

62
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:27,239
When one slits his wrist for someone?

63
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,680
Then change your mind.

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,229
To the Devil with your MPhil;

65
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:33,006
Think you've hit the jackpot

66
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,138
Getting a lover ready to lay down his life!

67
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:37,082
You're right,

68
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:39,774
But the nyaff didn't even slit his wrist properly!

69
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,839
Wouldn't he have died had he slit it properly?

70
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:44,176
One should have confidence in one's love, girl,

71
00:03:44,176 --> 00:03:46,357
They say its mere touch vivifies.

72
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,975
And what about all those who died -

73
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:49,617
Heer, Laila, Majnun, Ranjha [Romeo & Juliet] -

74
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,003
Why weren't they vivified?

75
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:52,522
Lack of knowledge, sweetheart.

76
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:53,848
They didn't know

77
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,469
That if they tried a loving touch instead of struggling

78
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,754
And dying in vain, they'd have been vivified!

79
00:03:57,754 --> 00:03:59,098
Divined the 'news' somehow

80
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,916
And lay down their lives just like that!

81
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,764
Honestly,

82
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:03,229
In which film did it happen like this?

83
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,081
I swear

84
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:06,505
I've not watched a single film like this.

85
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:08,191
But my heart says

86
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,883
That love does have such power.

87
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,715
And when my heart says something,

88
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:15,215
It wants me to agree to it.

89
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,347
Did you hear, Madame,

90
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,507
What she just said?

91
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,088
She'll only find peace when he slits his wrist properly!

92
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:32,459
Don't worry, Madame,

93
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,683
She must be kidding.

94
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,220
Does she intend to kill the poor lad with such kidding?

95
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,770
There, now...

96
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:06,201
Hello, Afzal?

97
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,757
Hello?

98
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,040
I've left after waiting for two hours.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,634
Your father left the office before my eyes

100
00:05:13,634 --> 00:05:14,964
And never came back.

101
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,854
I forgot to tell you about it.

102
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:19,041
We'd run into a right trouble at home.

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,294
Mehtab, you know,

104
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:22,695
Had slit his wrist.

105
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,690
Thankfully, we got to know on time.

106
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,932
He'd almost died.

107
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,745
For Farah?

108
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,398
As if he would for me!

109
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:33,712
He is bent upon laying down his life for Farah!

110
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:35,792
Such is his love?

111
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:36,600
Well,

112
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,567
He's proven it today.

113
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,103
I'll disconnect.

114
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,793
Hey, listen!

115
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,293
We'll talk in a while.

116
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:11,908
Sit, Madame.

117
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,318
Sit.

118
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,826
Please listen carefully.

119
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:23,114
This is the last of his theatrics

120
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:25,630
That I've tolerated.

121
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,772
The entire neighbourhood would know if someone from my family

122
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,557
Had to see the doctor because he'd slit his wrist!

123
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,818
Let this be the closing bit of news after this one -

124
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:37,580
Mehtab's marriage to Farah is not possible.

125
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:42,001
What would he protect my daughter

126
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,555
Who couldn't protect his own life?

127
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:18,630
Yes, sir?

128
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,413
Apologies, my good man; something came up and I had to leave my office.

129
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:26,165
My PA mentioned that you'd come and left.

130
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:27,688
Yes, sir.

131
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,019
Please, come now.

132
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,622
I'll be reaching my office in about 15 minutes.

133
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:31,517
No, sir...

134
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,831
I'd be unable to come.

135
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,158
What do you mean?

136
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,170
I won't be coming, sir.

137
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:50,766
Here.

138
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:53,285
I'm giving him a cheque 400,000 instead of 200,000.

139
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,313
Shove it in his face.

140
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:56,830
Threaten him if you have to

141
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,180
That if he left his job without notice,

142
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,470
He'd have to pay a penalty amounting to three months' pay!

143
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:08,444
The blighter wouldn't ever have dreamt about 400,000 Rupees!

144
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,817
Should I go to his place?

145
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:11,866
Obviously.

146
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,296
He's not answering his phone.

147
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,775
And should I say, also, that he should meet Dad?

148
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,543
He'd better.

149
00:08:19,543 --> 00:08:20,646
And would Dad

150
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:23,584
Meet him after his refusal?

151
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,925
Or will you give him a cheque or 400,000 too

152
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:29,446
And say, 'You'd better meet him, Dad'.

153
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:34,515
Where does he live?

154
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,287
Just about four alleys from here.

155
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,402
Get the car.

156
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,853
Please, sit down.

157
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:43,859
You'd call upon him?

158
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,474
Do you have a problem with it?

159
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,337
His house isn't like ours

160
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,776
That you can pull him into a corner and talk about it!

161
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,852
You'd come across Arifa the moment you get there,

162
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:54,559
Then, his Mum,

163
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,978
And Molvi Sahab is at home after the night prayer.

164
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,509
If you'd meet a man from his family before his eyes,

165
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,006
What would he think?

166
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,693
It'd be taken as your desperation.

167
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,435
I don't care.

168
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,832
You're the richest girl in the neighbourhood

169
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:12,917
But your dominion does not span it.

170
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:17,153
If Molvi Sahab pronounced a judgement, you'd be utterly disgraced in a moment!

171
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:18,822
Judgement?

172
00:09:18,822 --> 00:09:20,633
A Molvi's place is one of dignity,

173
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,621
And Mademoiselle would do well to honour it.

174
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,635
What kind of judgement?

175
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,142
A faithful girl

176
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:28,588
Strikes a deal with a Molvi's Sahab about 'love',

177
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:31,844
With the condition that he should two-time her.

178
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:34,200
You tell me if a harsh judgement ought to be ordained or not!

179
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,027
You're digging your own grave there.

180
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,671
And remember,

181
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:42,152
Just as the spade strikes the ground, Dad will have you sit in a palanquin for Mehtab.

182
00:09:42,152 --> 00:09:46,186
Besides, you've earned a bad name in the entire neighbourhood because of Mehtab.

183
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,369
Sorry,

184
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:51,855
But a 'bad name' is the only apt way to describe it.

185
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:57,794
Give me his number.

186
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,820
Sure.

187
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,222
Hello?

188
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,010
Hello.

189
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,456
This is my number

190
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,012
And it's me speaking.

191
00:10:58,599 --> 00:10:59,618
Remember,

192
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,992
If you stayed quiet today,

193
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:02,372
I could become your worst nightmare!

194
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:05,977
Reply to everything properly.

195
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,872
You're under your Dad's oath now,

196
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,887
Tell me that you're listening.

197
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:13,570
I'm listening.

198
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,727
Splendid.

199
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:17,632
Now I know how to get you talking.

200
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:18,747
Tell me, now,

201
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,634
Why did you refuse to meet Dad?

202
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,868
What would it do if I met him?

203
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,084
What's that noise?

204
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,084
It's --

205
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:27,580
It's the lads from the neighbourhood playing cricket.

206
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,569
Brilliant!

207
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:31,488
And you're there, betting on it!

208
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,255
I'm not into betting anymore.

209
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:36,485
I've signed a cheque of 400,000 for you.

210
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:39,743
Take it from Lubna whenever you want.

211
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,347
But I won't meet your father.

212
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,674
Why not?

213
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:46,214
Am I blowing these 400,000 for nothing?

214
00:11:46,214 --> 00:11:48,497
I won't collect those 400,000 either.

215
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:50,694
What's the matter with you?

216
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,211
Changing your colours like a chameleon!

217
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:56,362
I felt I was doing something worse than gambling,

218
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,321
So, I thought I would rather not.

219
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,224
To the --

220
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:01,558
Care to tell me

221
00:12:01,558 --> 00:12:03,113
How saving a girl's life

222
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,631
Is something wrong?

223
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,164
When someone else loses his life as one tries to save a girl's life,

224
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,729
That makes it very wrong.

225
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,925
Oh!

226
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:14,385
So you've come to know about the incident with the blighter Mehtab!

227
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:17,252
Don't push love away,

228
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,013
And don't call one who loves you a 'blighter'.

229
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:21,528
Honestly,

230
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,983
Has your girlfriend come to know?

231
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,148
Has she asked you

232
00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:27,979
Not to love Farah?

233
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,604
Tell that twit

234
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:32,438
It's not true love!

235
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:36,678
This is the first time when one's getting paid to 'love'!

236
00:12:36,678 --> 00:12:39,291
She hasn't the foggiest.

237
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,371
She doesn't know anything.

238
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:42,265
Look,

239
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,791
I'm in a right mess.

240
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,727
And you're intent on betraying me.

241
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,309
This sword called Mehtab is ready to strike my head off!

242
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,931
Dad's perplexed, too, because of your refusal.

243
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:53,759
God forbid if he voted in favour of Mehtab...

244
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,091
I'd --

245
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,741
I'd curse you!

246
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:57,573
And remember,

247
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,285
My curses always work!

248
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,596
If I vow to offer 100 additional prayers,

249
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,713
My wish is fulfilled after 12.

250
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:03,941
Fear me,

251
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,277
Or I'd say,

252
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:06,664
'May you never get the one'

253
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,102
'Who writes you letters'!

254
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:09,659
Wait!

255
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,097
Please don't curse me like this!

256
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:15,729
Scared the bejesus out of him!

257
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,287
Alright, then,

258
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,364
You're coming to the office tomorrow, aren't you?

259
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:24,064
I will.

260
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:26,276
Call Dad the moment I disconnect,

261
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:30,236
Say sorry and tell him you're coming tomorrow.

262
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,396
So much noise!

263
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,366
Cookie's been caught out.

264
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,423
Who's Cookie?

265
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,755
One of the lads.

266
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,156
Anyway.

267
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:41,882
You'd call him, right?

268
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:44,116
I will in a moment.

269
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,061
Okay, bye!

270
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:08,517
I will tell you when I can understand it myself.

271
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:12,951
It felt as if he'd shoved me from behind and I'd fallen face first!

272
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:14,985
Said plainly, 'I'm not coming',

273
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,842
And disconnected.

274
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:21,636
Figure out and tell me what it could mean!

275
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:26,008
Pay him a visit.

276
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:32,034
But I can swear we'd find no better suitor for Farah than him!

277
00:14:32,798 --> 00:14:36,824
There's no need to go there now.

278
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,976
He'll come to meet you tomorrow,

279
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,790
And apologise to you too.

280
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,179
Why did he refuse, then?

281
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,597
Because of Mehtab.

282
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:50,920
He thought

283
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,541
It's not good to have someone like him in the house

284
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,959
Who'd attempt suicides for me!

285
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:06,175
He shouldn't have taken Mehtab's body to the doctor in the first place.

286
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:08,939
Please decide the time for tomorrow.

287
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,989
I'll call and tell him.

288
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:12,001
No --

289
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,806
Please don't call him.

290
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:15,452
He'd have to apologise

291
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,366
Before you talk to him.

292
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,430
Just fix an appointment.

293
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,995
Lubna will call and tell him the time.

294
00:15:21,995 --> 00:15:22,788
The same

295
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,771
9 a.m.

296
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,840
May I go now?

297
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,770
Alright, go.

298
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,630
Yes, come in!

299
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,732
How do I come in?

300
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:21,249
You've bolted the door!

301
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,144
What's with bolting the door?

302
00:16:29,144 --> 00:16:30,203
I --

303
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:31,578
Wasn't quite paying attention --

304
00:16:31,578 --> 00:16:33,378
And -- Bolted it.

305
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:34,697
Beware, Monsieur Afzal.

306
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,748
You may get caught!

307
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,015
Why do you always suspect me?

308
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,077
Ask forgiveness!

309
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,328
I've never suspected you.

310
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,819
I always trust you, but you compel me to doubt!

311
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,567
Alright, please, go. I'm feeling sleepy.

312
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,142
Your phone's ringing.

313
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:58,870
So it is.

314
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:02,054
When the phone's with me,

315
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,276
It would ring now and then...

316
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:06,510
Answer it, then.

317
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,596
I will.

318
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:12,106
But never before me.

319
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:13,161
Right...

320
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,315
Please, Arifa, leave. I'm very sleepy!

321
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:18,855
Alright,

322
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:22,105
Promise me you'd sleep without answering the phone.

323
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:24,196
It's stopped ringing.

324
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:26,663
You'll see, it'll ring again soon.

325
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,239
And why are you going to bed so early?

326
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:33,678
Mind if I say something to rouse you?

327
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:35,567
Go on.

328
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:42,129
Dad's found out that you don't go to your office anymore.

329
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,697
You blew the gaff on me after all!

330
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,852
He told me himself.

331
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,509
Said, 'We are God's men'.

332
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:52,537
'We get the news even when we don't get it'.

333
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,219
You should fear, Afzal.

334
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,660
If he indeed gets the news,

335
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,012
He'd know who she is.

336
00:18:00,109 --> 00:18:01,865
He may say it over lunch tomorrow,

337
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:03,070
'Listen, my good man'!

338
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,780
'Her father had come to pray today'.

339
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,271
'Sat with me for long',

340
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:11,301
And what they talked about in their meeting...

341
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:14,054
God alone knows better.

342
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:15,612
Bolt the door, now,

343
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:16,739
Answer your phone,

344
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:20,009
And forget that you'd be able to sleep.

345
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,700
The blighter!

346
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:13,906
There he is, the geezer!

347
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:16,949
I mean -- the good man.

348
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:20,997
Peace, Uncle.

349
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,187
And upon you [as well].

350
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,975
How are you now?

351
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,092
I'm great.

352
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,678
Alright, then, get ready.

353
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:31,482
You're leaving for Karachi in half an hour.

354
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:32,870
What?

355
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,776
Look, you can't make us accept you as ours,

356
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:38,526
So it's better you'd not worsen our ties.

357
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:43,053
Your suicide attempt has embarrassed me greatly.

358
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,742
Your mother's almost ready

359
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:47,114
And waiting for you downstairs.

360
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:49,895
That which was destined to happen has come to be,

361
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:52,029
So you should better do what's best.

362
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,671
May I get ten minutes?

363
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:55,348
For what?

364
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,450
I want to sit on this swing one last time.

365
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:01,855
Sit, then.

366
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:03,082
No.

367
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:04,466
Not before you

368
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,906
But alone.

369
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,753
You may not like to hear it, but

370
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:10,887
Consider this the last wish of one who's about to depart.

371
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:12,923
Fulfil your wish.

372
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:17,262
Lubna will come and tell you when ten minutes have passed.

373
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:18,886
Otherwise, she'll tell me.

374
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,097
You wouldn't have to bother.

375
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,009
I won't sit here for more than 10 minutes.

376
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:24,557
Okay.

377
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,441
Come.

378
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,406
Hello?

379
00:20:58,622 --> 00:21:00,174
Peace be upon you.

380
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:01,018
And upon you.

381
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,886
Why weren't you answering the phone?

382
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,418
Arifa was with me.

383
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:07,081
You could've texted me that she's with you.

384
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:09,345
Next time, I will text.

385
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:10,246
Alright.

386
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:12,141
9 a.m. has been decided upon.

387
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:13,678
9 a.m.?

388
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:14,750
Yes.

389
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,685
You'll go to the office and meet Dad tomorrow morning.

390
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,162
I'll meet him.

391
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:19,787
Right,

392
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:21,457
Don't do something stupid.

393
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:23,396
I handled it today, saying

394
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,062
That you got angry because of Mehtab.

395
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,624
I'd be out of excuses tomorrow!

396
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,096
I'll be very careful.

397
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:33,100
You don't worry.

398
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,924
Please, tell me, though,

399
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,459
What if he said,

400
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,545
'Bring your parents along'? Should I?

401
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,033
Sure, bring them along.

402
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,143
That would seal everything.

403
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,568
Dad will be delighted to hear,

404
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:48,303
And exclaim, 'Such is my son's good fortune'!

405
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:51,108
What else am I paying 800,000 for?

406
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,953
What for?

407
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:54,079
You forgot already!

408
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,334
We'd decided that you'd turn out perfidious in the end!

409
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:59,999
How could I turn out perfidious?

410
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,560
Dad will remain firm over his word.

411
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,031
We don't accept perfidy here.

412
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:07,247
Don't scare me.

413
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,670
I swear I'm not trying to scare you.

414
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,701
I'm afraid myself.

415
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,726
But think over it and tell me,

416
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,026
Must I be perfidious?

417
00:22:16,026 --> 00:22:18,427
There's no other option!

418
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:20,592
We may just be parted...

419
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:21,822
What?

420
00:22:21,822 --> 00:22:23,887
I'm saying it right -

421
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,623
It'd do your job, and

422
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:28,701
Save love from this calumny.

423
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:30,396
Are you alright?

424
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:33,015
What 'love' and 'calumny' are you talking about?

425
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:35,904
No, I was just saying --

426
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:37,727
Love

427
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:39,595
Is pious

428
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:42,941
And in perfidy is its calumny.

429
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:46,639
Yet if that's what you desire, alright,

430
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,581
We'd calumniate it.

431
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:51,063
Alright, wait.

432
00:22:51,063 --> 00:22:53,749
Let Lubna come; we'll talk then.

433
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,110
May I call later?

434
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:57,266
No.

435
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,142
I'll call you myself.

436
00:22:59,142 --> 00:23:00,732
Alright.

437
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,284
I'll stay awake.

438
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:39,859
It would've been better if she'd come too.

439
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:43,797
We'd have seen her face one last time as we left.

440
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,015
I think she's retired.

441
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:49,311
Alright.

442
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:51,426
As it pleases her...

443
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:54,439
Come.

444
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:56,700
Sit.

445
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,483
Come, my dear.

446
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,687
God be with ye.

447
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,880
Bye.

448
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,259
Fire!

449
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,493
By God! Fire!

450
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:24,553
T --
-Where?

451
00:24:24,553 --> 00:24:26,756
Mlle Farah's swing on the terrace!

452
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,209
It's all up in flames!

453
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:30,730
Come!

454
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:46,991
Quickly! Get some water!

455
00:24:46,991 --> 00:24:48,632
Get some water!

456
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,250
Afzal!

457
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,600
Yes, Dad?

458
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:38,574
You're still awake?

459
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,568
I'm about to sleep, Dad.

460
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:43,753
Go to sleep early, my son.

461
00:26:43,753 --> 00:26:47,458
You have to go to work in the morning.

462
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,620
Right, Dad.

463
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,570
Shut up, Lubna!

464
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:10,281
Sleep peacefully, already!

465
00:27:10,281 --> 00:27:12,192
He'd have reached Karachi by now!

466
00:27:12,192 --> 00:27:13,779
Or you could call him

467
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,845
And mouth every four-letter word you can!

468
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,389
That's exactly what he wants

469
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:19,279
That I should call

470
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,497
And abuse him!

471
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:22,829
And he'd be delighted to hear them!

472
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:24,913
I won't insult him

473
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:28,020
For he doesn't even deserve that.

474
00:27:30,506 --> 00:27:31,546
Hey!

475
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:33,292
It's 2.30 already!

476
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,815
So what?

477
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:36,852
Take another leave.

478
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,996
It's not about taking a leave, Lubna.

479
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:42,251
I'd asked Afzal to wait for my call.

480
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,280
When did you say that?

481
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,512
Before the fire started.

482
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:47,213
Right...

483
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:49,846
That was three hours ago.

484
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,386
What do I do now?

485
00:27:51,386 --> 00:27:52,729
Just don't call him now.

486
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:55,093
The poor man must be sleeping now.

487
00:27:55,093 --> 00:27:57,823
But why had you told him you'd call?

488
00:27:57,823 --> 00:28:00,032
I don't know what had gotten into him!

489
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:01,479
He said,

490
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,793
'In perfidy is love's calumny'.

491
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,591
'So, instead of that',

492
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,749
'We may just be parted'.

493
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,251
He gave me a right fright there.

494
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,234
I said it, promptly,

495
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:12,871
'I'd ask Lubna for advice'

496
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,871
'And then talk to you'.

497
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:17,298
God...

498
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:19,168
Think of something!

499
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:19,947
He said

500
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,966
That if Dad invited his parents,

501
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,408
His father would finalise everything that instant!

502
00:28:24,408 --> 00:28:25,714
So let him!

503
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:27,763
Listen to the whole thing.

504
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:31,230
His father is the kind who'd stay true to his words.

505
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,480
And also

506
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,650
They don't accept perfidy there.

507
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,110
What are you looking at?

508
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,331
I'm not looking...

509
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,908
I'm thinking

510
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:47,862
How fortunate the girl he loves is!

511
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:50,157
As if I care a hoot!

512
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:51,752
Don't insult love like this.

513
00:28:51,752 --> 00:28:54,577
It afflicts even the likes of you in its anger!

514
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,921
Let's talk business, shall we?

515
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,671
Text him and ask him to postpone the meeting with Dad.

516
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:02,232
How would he postpone it?

517
00:29:02,232 --> 00:29:03,933
He could call and say,

518
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,870
Something came up and he's got to leave for Karachi,

519
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,702
And it'd take a few days.

520
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,516
What would that do?

521
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,623
Buy a few days' time

522
00:29:11,623 --> 00:29:13,763
To think, strategise, and decide.

523
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:15,107
But this time,

524
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:17,339
You'd better both think and strategise.

525
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,560
I'd say

526
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,116
Get the poor man out of this trouble too.

527
00:29:21,116 --> 00:29:22,760
Mehtab's gone,

528
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,042
And judging by the way he's left,

529
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,872
He's not coming back in your life ever again.

530
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:28,372
The danger is past.

531
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,304
Now, it's better that you free Afzal too.

532
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:33,143
You're using up all of his girlfriend's time.

533
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:34,537
This is not fair.

534
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:36,275
Pay him for this farce

535
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,697
And relieve him from this responsibility.

536
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:41,839
What will I say to Dad?

537
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,242
Dad is Dad, after all.

538
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:45,893
What's the worst that can happen even if he found out the truth?

539
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,148
He'd be a bit angry,

540
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:49,288
But getting angry with you is something he's incapable of,

541
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,727
So, he'd just forgive you and spare himself.

542
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:53,682
So I should sign a cheque of 800,000?

543
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:55,474
Sign one.

544
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,740
He's hit the jackpot then!

545
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:56,910
'Your work is done... You don't need to meet Dad now... I've signed a cheque of 800,000; collect it from Lubna... Thanks'.

546
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,325
I've made some for you as well.

547
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:04,855
Have it.

548
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,781
Your suit's in the cupboard,

549
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,903
And Alladio polished your shoes last night.

550
00:32:14,282 --> 00:32:15,615
Sit down, will you?

551
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,594
What's the matter?

552
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,201
And what's this?

553
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,574
You came here straight from bed?

554
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,716
Why, mate?

555
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,744
There's no water here to wash your face.

556
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,756
What would you do?

557
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:34,437
I'm not going anywhere.

558
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:36,495
I've come to meet you.

559
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:37,757
Hey!

560
00:32:37,835 --> 00:32:41,871
Weren't you full of yourself last night saying you've got to go there early in the morning?

561
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:45,092
Yesterday's plan ended in the morning.

562
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:50,591
Mind if I ask you something?

563
00:32:50,591 --> 00:32:51,996
Not at all.

564
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:55,528
Is there room for being self-seeking in love?

565
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:58,448
Only in love is there room for being self-seeking, you bugger!

566
00:32:58,448 --> 00:32:59,377
How much?

567
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,068
As much as possible.

568
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:02,489
One's got to be willing

569
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,263
To reduce the world to ashes to get one's beloved!

570
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:08,326
Do you know what Samina had last told me?

571
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:09,290
What?

572
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,774
'Elope with me'.

573
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,373
'Get legally married to me'.

574
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:14,594
I said, 'You're insane'.

575
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:17,330
She got married ten days later,

576
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,188
And I felt like I lost my sanity.

577
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:22,285
Remember,

578
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:25,410
Don't turn tail once you fall in love.

579
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:29,544
Or you'd end up like me, bugger!

580
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,610
Today, I listen to others' stories,

581
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,574
And she, her husband's abuses.

582
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:38,328
I've learnt this at the price of losing her -

583
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:41,711
Don't think what Dad will say when you fall in love;

584
00:33:41,711 --> 00:33:44,977
See, instead, what your heart says.

585
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:55,579
In which cupboard have you kept the suit?

586
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,665
The one over there.

587
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,310
So you're going?

588
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,180
Yes.

589
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,407
Hello?

590
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:18,267
This is Ibrahim speaking.

591
00:34:19,285 --> 00:34:22,301
You don't need to come to the office.

592
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:25,969
Bring your parents to our place after nightfall.

593
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,353
I'd like to talk to them first.

594
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:32,061
Tell them they'd be having dinner with us.

595
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:34,632
Ri -- Right, Uncle.

596
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,206
Alright. Take care.

597
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:37,517
Okay?

598
00:35:14,081 --> 00:35:17,161
He didn't wash his face and hands,

599
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:18,688
Didn't change his clothes,

600
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:22,067
Didn't have breakfast... How did he leave for office?

601
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,218
It's never happened this way before!

602
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:25,590
Leave it be, Dad.

603
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,467
You know, too, that he doesn't go to his office now.

604
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:31,999
He does say he's leaving for office.

605
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,434
I have a feeling she studies at some university.

606
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,561
I have no problem with it,

607
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:44,106
If only the whippersnapper would tell me who she is!

608
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:51,187
Suspicion isn't justified either, Molvi Sahab.

609
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:52,738
Ask Arifa

610
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:54,728
If I've ever suspected him,

611
00:35:54,728 --> 00:35:57,013
Pronounce a judgement against me.

612
00:35:57,013 --> 00:35:58,956
Dad's right, Mum.

613
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,732
She studies at a university.

614
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:02,800
Right...

615
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,323
You're back from the office already?

616
00:36:07,323 --> 00:36:07,896
I --

617
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:10,288
I don't go to the office now, Dad.

618
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:12,831
My job ended on the second day itself.

619
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:15,581
You should've told this earlier.

620
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:17,436
I get the news

621
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:20,419
And get to know everything.

622
00:36:20,419 --> 00:36:22,291
Anyway.

623
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:24,654
What have you thought about, now?

624
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:26,590
What would you do?

625
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,235
May I get married, Dad?

626
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,870
In the name of God! [auspicious beginning]

627
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:36,995
Would you tell us after you've tied the knot,

628
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,589
Or invite us too?

629
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,402
I hold you very dear, Dad.

630
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:46,358
I fear both your anger and affection,

631
00:36:46,358 --> 00:36:49,079
Which is why I make mistakes.

632
00:36:49,258 --> 00:36:50,887
Talk about your marriage.

633
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:52,767
You're splendid, Molvi Sahab.

634
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,267
How can he get married?

635
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,844
He's not got a job and earns nothing.

636
00:36:57,844 --> 00:37:01,387
And only God knows who's the one he's carrying on with!

637
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,294
Sh -- She's pure and fair.

638
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:06,670
But

639
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,782
I'm not getting married just yet.

640
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,284
I just want you to

641
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:13,394
Get things started.

642
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:16,766
Get things started with whom?

643
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,728
With Monseigneur Sheikh Ibrahim.

644
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:24,929
How does Monseigneur know her?

645
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,788
She's --

646
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,450
Monseigneur's --

647
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,470
Daughter.

648
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:36,018
What?

649
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:38,035
Wha --

650
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:40,319
Would you say that again? What --?

651
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:42,993
Did you hear what he just said?

652
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:46,754
No, I'd say you tell me again --

653
00:37:46,754 --> 00:37:49,289
Wh -- What do you want to say? I --

654
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:50,851
I couldn't quite get it --

655
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,398
Wha -- What do you want to say?

656
00:37:55,104 --> 00:37:56,308
I --

657
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,009
I'm talking about Monseigneur.

658
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,148
It's fine up to that point.

659
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:04,443
But I think I heard that you...

660
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:07,942
Are talking about his daughter.

661
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,295
I'm --

662
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:12,663
I'm going to marry his daughter.

663
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:16,440
There he is saying it again.

664
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,426
I mean,

665
00:38:17,426 --> 00:38:22,738
One who'd not give him a job has agreed to give him his daughter.

666
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,387
His pulse is alright,

667
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:30,698
Nor has he got a fever...

668
00:38:30,698 --> 00:38:33,785
Still, it'd be better if you see a doctor.

669
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:35,485
Someone like me

670
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:39,235
Cannot know about the afflictions of the mind.

671
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,822
He's invited the two of you

672
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:42,965
To dinner

673
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:44,694
After the night prayer.

674
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:48,794
He's saying the same thing again, Ruqaiyya; tell him

675
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:52,498
That excesses of either delight or shock are bad for me

676
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,227
And if something happened to me,

677
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:58,119
Your Afzal would be responsible for it!

678
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:00,619
Dad, I'm telling the truth!

679
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:03,519
Keep on saying that, my good man.

680
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,471
I can't believe it.

681
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:09,389
I'd have gone up to the terrace for a stroll

682
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:12,082
Were it not so sunny!

683
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,712
Afzal's right.

684
00:39:13,712 --> 00:39:15,332
My friend, Lubna -

685
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,411
She's the one who writes him letters!

686
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,537
She even calls him.

687
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:20,102
I'd answered once too!

688
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:21,405
I think she's been successful!

689
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:24,424
She would've convinced her father!

690
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:25,634
No -- It's --

691
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:27,555
Not Lubna!

692
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:38,143
Ask me first!

693
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:44,412
You just saw the name on the phone and said what you figured before everyone!

694
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:47,330
It's not Lubna.

695
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:49,040
Then?

696
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,500
Farah.

697
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
