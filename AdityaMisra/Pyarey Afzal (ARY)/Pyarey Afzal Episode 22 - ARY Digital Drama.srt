1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,660
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,914
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:24,021
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:30,449
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,992
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:40,654
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,586
Listen!

8
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:11,202
Where to?
-To Samina's.

9
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:14,598
Today's her wedding anniversary.

10
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,552
As in, it's been another year.

11
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:20,333
Is hers the kind of wedding one would commemorate?

12
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,358
Her husband does every year.

13
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:24,524
After all, it's her husband's 'love marriage' to her.

14
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:29,440
In two years of this 'love marriage', she's been beaten by her 'lover' some 200 times!

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,968
Only God will ask about this.

16
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:33,778
What will you give her as a gift?

17
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,422
Why would she need one?

18
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,890
She has a far greater need for cash.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,620
I'm thinking I'd give her a thousand.

20
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,020
And who will get the security guard his food?

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,943
I'll be back before he is.

22
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:48,020
And who'll tell you he's back?

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,101
Well,

24
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:50,762
I get to know

25
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:54,980
The moment he sets foot in the alley!

26
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,581
May I go now?

27
00:01:58,581 --> 00:01:59,891
Yes.

28
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,619
Go.

29
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,921
But please do tell me when you're back

30
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:12,165
How you get to know the moment he sets foot in the alley.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,806
Peace, Aunt.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,898
Babu Hamid!

33
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,681
Babu Hamid!

34
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:07,586
Babu Hamid's not here.

35
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,850
I've come back because of you.

36
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,130
Tell me you're awestruck to look at me!

37
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,755
Yes.

38
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:19,944
I sure am awestruck.

39
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:21,969
That's why I don't deck up too much!

40
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,096
The thing is,

41
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,910
It's Samina's wedding anniversary.

42
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,210
I'm going to attend that.

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,230
Oh.

44
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,169
Good.

45
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,126
If you stare at me like that, the evil eye would curse me.

46
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:37,815
Say that it's as the Lord has willed [compliment]!

47
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,660
As the Lord has willed.

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,368
Do you guard

49
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:47,768
Empty-handed,

50
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,817
Or do you carry a gun, too?

51
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:50,532
No,

52
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,972
I have a gun with me.

53
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,337
Where is it if it's with you?

54
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,203
Of course,

55
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,840
I leave it there.

56
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,649
Bring it along someday.

57
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:01,110
Why?

58
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,598
What'd you do with it?

59
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,449
Fire it, of course.

60
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,160
Wali would be scared if he found out!

61
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,000
You don't need to scare him; he's already scared.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,898
He's scared of you.

63
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:14,430
If, one of these days, you left, or got married,

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,580
What would I do?

65
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,555
I'd be left alone.

66
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,328
Then, you get married too!

67
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,735
Leave that be!

68
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:27,770
Which lad would marry me while Wali's around?

69
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,970
I'll take care of Wali.

70
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,340
Just prepare for the wedding.

71
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,430
Is that a proposal?

72
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,054
Proposal?

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,418
Would you look at your own condition?

74
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:42,040
Earning 10,000 a month and talking about Yasmin!

75
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,880
When did I ever talk about Yasmin?

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,820
And whenever did I propose?

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,150
There!

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,072
That's it with all the lads!

79
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,930
If a girl rejects them, they'd promptly say, 'Sorry'!

80
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,420
'That's not what I meant; you're mistaken'.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,791
I swear to God I didn't mean that!

82
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,813
You don't need to swear.

83
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:05,573
I'm 21 now, so I can understand in a moment what such things mean.

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,264
What are your plans for the future?

85
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:10,607
Plans for the future?

86
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:15,430
One should know when this blue uniform will be taken off and you'll become a great man.

87
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,405
What makes a great man?

88
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:21,158
The one who has a respectable job or the one who has a lot of money?

89
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:24,102
I have neither.
-Your name's out.

90
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:25,564
Out of?

91
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,630
I'd kept you as an option.

92
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,580
Proposals will line up once Wali's out of the picture, you'll see!

93
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,810
I thought once you got a respectable job,

94
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,467
I could think about you, too!

95
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,000
She

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,340
Must be waiting for you.

97
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,360
Who?

98
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,337
Samina. It's her wedding anniversary, innit?

99
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:47,330
Good Lord, it's so late!

100
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,430
And you!

101
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,003
You have such a habit of keeping one talking whenever one says two words to you!

102
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,257
Alright, I'll get going.

103
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,087
And

104
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,380
If you need any tea, or even water,

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,960
Just ask Mam.

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,490
Alright.

107
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,110
And don't stare like that.

108
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,820
Have you ever seen modesty in my eyes?

109
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,989
I can see that.

110
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:12,530
Your eyes should have just as much modesty, alright?

111
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,430
See,

112
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,630
To be comely is no flaw; please, do look.

113
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,220
But not in a way that it seems

114
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,403
You're looking at me the wrong way.

115
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:23,030
Fine.

116
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,610
I'll get going.

117
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,816
Happy wedding anniversary!

118
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,955
What is it?

119
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,205
Nothing.

120
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:02,891
Nothing, really. Sit.

121
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,720
Where is he?

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,830
He's not come.

123
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,160
You've kept a cake with candles here as if he's on the way. Call him!

124
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,890
His phone's switched off.

125
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,330
So that's what you're so sad about.

126
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,210
Sit tight,

127
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,254
I'll be back.
-Wait.

128
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:26,159
Tell me,

129
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:29,010
If someone asked you what kind of a girl Samina is,

130
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:32,317
What would you tell him?

131
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,545
Why are you asking that?

132
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,611
Just asking.

133
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:38,939
I want to see myself through your eyes.

134
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,940
I swear by your modesty and loyalty.

135
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,060
Don't swear by my loyalty.

136
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,430
I'm incapable of being loyal now.

137
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,837
What do you mean?

138
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,304
If you don't like it, just say,

139
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,715
'You have no right to live, Samina'.

140
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,470
Who said you have no right to live?

141
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,980
And why are you saying this today?

142
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,270
I'm leaving today.

143
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,730
I was just waiting for you.

144
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,679
If he comes back, ask him

145
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,720
To forgive me,

146
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,848
And set me free.

147
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,340
It's you, Aunt!

148
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,539
Would you like to have dinner right now?

149
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,266
No,

150
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,450
But when Babu Hamid's here,

151
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,539
I'll have dinner.

152
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:12,994
He'll be here shortly.

153
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,640
Alright.

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,577
Come here and sit. I want to talk to you about something.

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,110
Did you have a house of your own in Hyderabad?

156
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,630
I mean, you didn't rent a flat, did you?

157
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,530
No.

158
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,018
Why, then, have you come here to work for 10,000 a month?

159
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,472
It's just...

160
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,620
That destiny brought me here.

161
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,780
Surely, your marriage is not being planned?

162
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,270
Not at all?

163
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,249
And you seriously don't have an affair with anyone?

164
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,373
I can't believe it, though,

165
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,550
That a lad like you couldn't find a girl.

166
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,560
I swear to God I haven't.

167
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,020
But you have, now, right?

168
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,990
You've put her under such a spell that she tries to keep you happy day and night!

169
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,150
Who?

170
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,590
You're being demure?

171
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,210
No, I'm a bit worried.

172
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,420
Why?

173
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,870
Why are you worried?

174
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,540
You just said,

175
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,290
She tries day and night to keep me happy.

176
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,944
I thought you're actually talking about someone.

177
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:30,236
I'm talking about Yasmin.

178
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,360
She's very nice,

179
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,890
Yes, she does look a tad like the angry type,

180
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,940
But

181
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,920
She isn't really that type.

182
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,980
So, what do you think about her?

183
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,518
Or do I have to tell you what she thinks about you?

184
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,865
Yasmin?
-Samina's leaving, Mam!

185
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,347
She won't live with him anymore.

186
00:11:00,347 --> 00:11:02,217
She's packing her things and saying,

187
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:03,423
'Forgive me',

188
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:06,820
'But I won't live with Salim any longer'.

189
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,477
Come with me. This way.

190
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,079
Samina?

191
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:17,994
Where are you going at this hour?

192
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,923
He's fallen from a moving bus!

193
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,778
His phone's lost, too!

194
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:23,900
He's got injuries on his head and face.

195
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,389
But he's fine now.

196
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:27,566
He was using someone else's phone,

197
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,840
And said, 'I'd have to stay at the hospital'.

198
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,320
'It'd be better if you come'.

199
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,567
In that case, take Afzal along.
-No.

200
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:37,038
He suspects Afzal, too.

201
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,610
Afzal scolded him one day,

202
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,240
And he quietened.

203
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,025
He came home drunk yesterday, saying, 'Tell me everything',

204
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,080
'What's going on between the two of you'?

205
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,250
He's never going to change.

206
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,209
But don't worry.

207
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,701
I'm not going anywhere.

208
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,730
Good morning, sir.

209
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,443
Good morning.

210
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,393
Very good morning.

211
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:20,890
Tell me, now,

212
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,830
Do you remember me?

213
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,080
Mehtab.

214
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,425
Mehtab Chawla.

215
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,903
Don't you remember?

216
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,126
Farah Ibrahim's fiancé.

217
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,880
The engagement may have been temporarily broken, but that does not mean I'd forget you.

218
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,300
Whatever are you, mate?

219
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,470
Working as a security guard, dreaming of marrying Farah Ibrahim?

220
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,047
I don't, anymore.

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,810
In plainer words, she's found out about your situation.

222
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,097
Yes, sir.

223
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,600
Can you see this office?

224
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,950
Which office, sir?

225
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,350
Why, the same you're standing outside as a security guard.

226
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,490
I can, sir.

227
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm having an office just as big as this one built.

228
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,850
If you want, you can leave this job and come to me for work.

229
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,940
I'll even give you a raise.

230
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,246
Thank you, sir.

231
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,964
How much do you earn?

232
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,938
10,000 a month.

233
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:40,140
Good Lord!

234
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,150
10,000 a month, and

235
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,830
Loving Farah Ibrahim!

236
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,830
Leave love out of this, sir.

237
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,640
When love came into this world,

238
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,990
It didn't bring wealth to this world.

239
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,670
Good one.

240
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,720
Stay with it.

241
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,990
We'll meet again

242
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,039
After the break.

243
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,440
Have you bought the cake?

244
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,700
Bought the cake, and some sweets, too.

245
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,730
Monseigneur had said that it's not proper to just bring a cake.

246
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,560
That's right, but for those whose son's missing...

247
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,010
How could I give them sweets?

248
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,950
Anyway,

249
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,980
He'll be found if he's gone missing.

250
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,861
I'll say it's for searching for him. Let's go.

251
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,866
Come.

252
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,593
Get the glass fitted nice and quick.

253
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,630
Mademoiselle, it seems like someone's thrown a stone at this!

254
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,131
A flower vase, not a stone.

255
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:11,792
But don't keep on talking; get the glass fixed.

256
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,150
The work's going on.

257
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,859
The vase is alright, innit?

258
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,771
Nobody's downstairs except the servants.

259
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,930
Where's Mum?

260
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,785
She's gone over to Afzal's.

261
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,346
Who is it?

262
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:50,186
Peace be upon you. It's you, Aunt!

263
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:51,775
And upon you, peace.

264
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,190
Mum, would you look at who's here!

265
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,933
Come.

266
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,731
In the name of the Lord [auspicious beginning].

267
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,900
What are the sweets and cake for?

268
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,846
I'll tell you in a moment.

269
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,565
But first, give me a hug.

270
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,490
I've come to your place for the first time.

271
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,339
That's what this is for.

272
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,564
Thank you.

273
00:16:25,997 --> 00:16:27,806
Please, come.

274
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,270
I thought you'd come to tell me about Farah's wedding,

275
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,380
And that's what the sweets are for.

276
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,400
That day shall come, too, if the Lord so wills.

277
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,873
For now, I just thought I'd meet you and ask how you are.

278
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:59,960
You're very brave.

279
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,440
When God gives one Afzal ['the most excellent one'],

280
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,504
He gives one the most formidable ['Afzal'] courage.

281
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,721
Tea, or coffee?

282
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,280
Coffee.

283
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,207
Would you have coffee, too, Mum?

284
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:19,052
It's enough for me that she has a cup.

285
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,495
How are your daughters?

286
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:23,985
By the Lord's grace, they're both fine.

287
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:26,885
Farah had come to meet you.

288
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,125
I was scared to see her.

289
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,500
I even asked her, 'What has my Afzal done this time'?

290
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,700
But Afzal had left by then.

291
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,370
Yes...

292
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,200
It was only when she reminded me

293
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,720
That I remembered that he'd left...

294
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,170
But what's it with these lads?

295
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,250
They'd even tease one in one's thoughts!

296
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,269
Touché on that one.

297
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,190
Monseigneur

298
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,130
Came back from the Mosque rather distressed one of these days.

299
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,070
He told me that Molvi Sahab was only praying for the good name

300
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,842
And righteous conduct of children.

301
00:18:13,118 --> 00:18:15,805
My Afzal's conduct is righteous.

302
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:19,130
It's just that he has a bad name.

303
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,040
People have great expectations from a Molvi's son.

304
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,840
They say that angels are born to the family of a Molvi.

305
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,502
One's good name is quite naturally at stake.

306
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:32,300
Monseigneur thinks the same.

307
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,200
He thinks one can't find someone like Afzal anywhere in Hyderabad.

308
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,298
Look at the Lord's doing!

309
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:47,470
He isn't anywhere in Hyderabad himself.

310
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,418
Please give me his picture.

311
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,546
Picture?

312
00:18:58,546 --> 00:18:59,552
What'd you do with it?

313
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:01,322
Monseigneur has asked for one.

314
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,161
He said he'd send one to Karachi.

315
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:07,086
It'd take just four or six days to find him.

316
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,280
Don't worry,

317
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,016
When Monseigneur's determined to do something,

318
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:16,184
He doesn't rest until he's accomplished it.

319
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,806
How old is he?

320
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,305
Old?

321
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:22,894
Yes, how old is he?

322
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:26,287
By the Lord's grace, he's completed 56 years.
-May God will

323
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:29,028
That he complete another 56!

324
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:30,784
Arifa!

325
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:32,219
Bring the coffee already!

326
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:33,485
And while you're at it,

327
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:36,891
Get me a cup as well.

328
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,905
Please, sit.

329
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,798
I'll get the picture.

330
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,740
Hello?

331
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,973
Farah?

332
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,334
Yes?

333
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:08,988
Didn't you recognise me?

334
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:11,707
It's Mehtab.

335
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:15,750
But your voice doesn't sound like Mehtab's.

336
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,090
Your voice doesn't sound like Farah's either.

337
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,660
Well,

338
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,890
Let's be brief.

339
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,920
Why have you called?

340
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,570
Who's fuelling that arrogance?

341
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,840
The man with a gun doing his job for 10,000 a month?

342
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,350
Who are you talking about?

343
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,940
Your lover, of course!

344
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,820
Afzal?

345
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,130
Yes.

346
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,724
Your Afzal.

347
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,460
Where'd you see him?

348
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,878
I saw him twice,

349
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:45,630
And

350
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,870
I've just seen him now.

351
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,300
Is he in Karachi?

352
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,970
As if you don't know at all!

353
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,905
I do know,

354
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:57,234
But I thought he may've lied to me...

355
00:20:57,234 --> 00:21:00,050
He's been telling the truth so far...

356
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,850
So, tell me, where in Karachi is he?

357
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,928
He's a security guard at my friend's office, the bugger!

358
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:08,634
Don't insult him!

359
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,057
Alright,

360
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:14,553
Insult him if you like...

361
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,240
No problem.

362
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,830
'No problem'?

363
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,840
Tell me the address.

364
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,500
It's Farah, right?

365
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,442
Do I have to repeat it every now and then?

366
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,560
No.

367
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,970
The thing is

368
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:32,060
Your voice sounds just like Lubna's.

369
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,780
Anyway,

370
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,890
Give me his address.

371
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,050
So he hasn't given you his address?

372
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,290
Would you talk a load of rubbish or tell me the address?

373
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,240
I'd tell you on one condition.

374
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,340
Condition?

375
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,010
Go on.

376
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,820
Tell me that you'd reconsider me.

377
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,540
'Reconsider'?

378
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,500
By the Lord, he isn't your type!

379
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,040
He looks like a hooligan,

380
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,360
And sounds unlettered.

381
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,930
After all, status matters!

382
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,950
Yes...

383
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,680
Sometimes, I think about all of this, too.

384
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,108
Tell me the address,

385
00:22:04,108 --> 00:22:06,416
I'd catch him red-handed.

386
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,193
The blighter

387
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,303
Had told me

388
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:10,114
He's got an office in Karachi!

389
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:11,007
Hey!

390
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:13,093
Such a white lie!

391
00:22:13,093 --> 00:22:15,241
That's it!

392
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:18,240
Alright, I'll text you his address.

393
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,577
No, just tell me the address.

394
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:22,500
No need to text me.

395
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,010
I've got a pen and paper with me.

396
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,890
I'll write it down.

397
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,060
Then, write down.

398
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,381
Go on...

399
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,227
Okay,

400
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,684
Thank you.

401
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,478
The pleasure's all mine.

402
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:47,209
Okay, bye.
-Bye, but tell me, you'd reconsider me, right?

403
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,670
I'd have to, now!

404
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,070
Have a good day.

405
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,451
I will.

406
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:54,072
You too.

407
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,912
Bye.

408
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,960
What were you doing in my room?

409
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,460
Looking for you.

410
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,743
Why?

411
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,073
It's --

412
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,380
I'd come to tell you

413
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,260
That he'd called.

414
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,616
Who?

415
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,870
Afzal.

416
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,299
He was saying, 'Congratulations',

417
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,767
'I've got a job'.

418
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:43,470
He's enlisted as a security guard for 10,000 a month.

419
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,260
So you'd come to tell me this.

420
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,202
No.

421
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:49,130
I'd come to tell you that there's no chance of a rejection now.

422
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,210
He's got a job now!

423
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,010
What's his number?

424
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,699
Whatever it may be,

425
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,496
I'm not telling you that!

426
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,158
Monseigneur's said 4 to 6 days.

427
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:30,795
One can't tell whether it'll be 4 or 6.

428
00:24:30,795 --> 00:24:31,714
Either way,

429
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:35,396
Tell him that one's gone by.

430
00:24:35,396 --> 00:24:36,848
Didn't I tell you,

431
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:41,169
Now that Monseigneur's decided on it, he'd bring Afzal back.

432
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,584
That's alright, but

433
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:47,240
I don't have the courage for any more than 4 to 6 days.

434
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,300
May it not be that his ride stop

435
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,030
Only when my pall is borne.

436
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,837
God forbid!

437
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:55,044
May the Lord bless you with a long life.

438
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:57,970
You have to see your son's happiness now.

439
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,440
Whether or nor I see his happiness,

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
It'd delight me

441
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,335
If I saw him.

442
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:08,669
Just tell Monseigneur about my condition as you've seen me,

443
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:13,800
If the Lord wills so, he'd be so merciful...

444
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,117
In the Lord's protection [farewell].

445
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:17,033
God be with ye.

446
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,160
Do you ask people to have mercy, Mum?

447
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,030
When have I ever asked people, my dear?

448
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,340
I'm crying out to Him

449
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,317
So that He may listen somehow.

450
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,880
Open the door!

451
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,458
There.

452
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:28,140
Give me his number.

453
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,651
I can't give you his number.

454
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,751
He's sworn by his head.

455
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:35,100
I'm having you swear by my head!

456
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,772
A sister's head is no more than a watermelon in front of the beloved's head!

457
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:40,212
Remember, then,

458
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:41,820
There'll be such a scene today

459
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,751
That you'd remember till your last breath!

460
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:45,898
Another scene?

461
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:47,507
Let Dad come.

462
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:48,896
You say that everyday,

463
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:53,130
But one can see clearly that you've not even talked to Mum!

464
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,606
One 'I've tasted blood',

465
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:56,323
And you said that I was singing!

466
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,160
Give me his number.

467
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,500
Don't even think about his number.

468
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,088
Have you no shame?

469
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,920
Exactly! That's the thing about love -

470
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,670
First, you feel shy and ashamed to admit it...

471
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,980
Then,

472
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,316
You're left with everything but shame!

473
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:17,132
So things have gotten so far?

474
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,958
That's my grief...

475
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:22,400
Before things could go anywhere,

476
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,950
That wretch went to Karachi.

477
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,072
Alright, brace yourself.

478
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:29,742
Why?

479
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:32,649
I'm going to talk to Mum and Dad today.

480
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:33,823
I swear by you,

481
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,745
I will, today!

482
00:27:35,745 --> 00:27:38,482
What happens next is your fate!

483
00:27:38,482 --> 00:27:40,536
Wait!

484
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:44,185
I have his address.

485
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:48,972
I can give you that.

486
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,132
Mum's here.

487
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,719
What happened, Mum?

488
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:08,087
Don't ask me anything.

489
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,880
This lass has been a tyrant.

490
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,480
She's earned the curses of a mother and a sister.

491
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,000
What's that in your hand?

492
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,482
His picture.

493
00:28:16,482 --> 00:28:19,390
I've brought one for your Dad.

494
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:22,300
He's said he'd be able to find him in a few days.

495
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,430
You don't need to search now, Mum.

496
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,872
His address has been found.

497
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,534
In fact, his new cellphone number's been found out, too.

498
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:34,957
What's his address?

499
00:28:34,957 --> 00:28:37,460
And what's his phone number?

500
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,545
The number's in Lubna's cellphone,

501
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:43,245
And the address in her hand.

502
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,680
Get it from her, will you?

503
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,550
And please don't tell me later

504
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,749
That someone's cursing me,

505
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:56,550
Because it's my turn to curse now.

506
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,297
One incantation from me

507
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:03,396
May very well burn your sweet Lubna to death.

508
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,080
Why do you have his address and phone number?

509
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,528
Why isn't it with Farah?

510
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:17,930
Why would Farah have it?

511
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,480
Whatever is she to him?

512
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,880
She'd invited his family over and left them humiliated.

513
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,650
And what had she said about him?

514
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,170
'He's a first rate fraudster'?

515
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,730
'A lover for hire'?

516
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,610
Now, if he's sent me his address,

517
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,190
Why is she up in flames?

518
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,300
I don't fear her incantations either.

519
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,990
The prayers of those who slander love like that don't work,

520
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,304
Let alone curses!

521
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,751
Where's his address?

522
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,291
Here.

523
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,380
And phone number?

524
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't have his number.

525
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,356
I'd lied to her.

526
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,162
May I go?

527
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,950
I'll take my leave.

528
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:32,997
Hello, Lubna?

529
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,208
'Lubna' again?

530
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,280
I'd told you I'm not Lubna.

531
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,886
I'd said it then,

532
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:40,155
But today, the number is Lubna's, too!

533
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:41,193
Mehtab,

534
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:43,136
Everything's upside-down in love.

535
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,217
If an honourable man can steal your heart,

536
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:48,220
Can't I steal Lubna's cellphone?

537
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,000
Yes...

538
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,910
Touché.

539
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,660
So, even if you get a call from Dad's phone,

540
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,365
Just think that Farah's calling.

541
00:30:57,365 --> 00:30:59,231
Okay, I get it.

542
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,807
But promise me, too,

543
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:04,220
That you won't talk in Dad's voice when calling from his number.

544
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,771
Don't be silly, Mehtab.

545
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:09,700
If I call from Dad's number, just think that Dad's talking.

546
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm not that silly either.

547
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,190
Alright,

548
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,170
Did you meet Afzal again?

549
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,999
Am I a pleb who'd meet a security guard like Afzal again and again?

550
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,240
You don't understand the dignity of work at all!

551
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,730
That's why I could never love you!

552
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,930
Please don't say that.

553
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,310
I've wept over you a lot...

554
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:33,540
You daft dimbo! You can weep, but can't respect someone working honestly?

555
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,430
This --

556
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,110
You're saying 'daft dimbo' in good humour, right?

557
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,660
I wish you would've just kissed Afzal's face on seeing him,

558
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,920
Held his hand like a faithful devotee, saying,

559
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,882
'You're such a great man, Afzal'.

560
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:46,000
'While at this job, you didn't think at all'

561
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
'That your salary is just 10,000 and designation nothing'!

562
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,420
How could I kiss Afzal's face?

563
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,990
Seeing him makes my blood boil!

564
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,208
I feel like breaking his face!

565
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:00,417
But then,

566
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,510
I stop because of you.

567
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,410
Because of me?

568
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,454
You're impressed by him, right?

569
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:12,460
He may do any lowly work, and you call it 'dignity', right?

570
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,060
Alright,

571
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,851
Keep an eye on him.

572
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,510
Eye?

573
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,902
I mean, don't let him go anywhere.

574
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:21,821
I want to catch the blighter red-handed.

575
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:23,640
Why do you want to catch him, Farah?

576
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,920
Why don't you let go?

577
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,340
You don't understand a girl's problem.

578
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,810
She breaks a hundred times over before her trust breaks.

579
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,290
Just think that if I saw him in a security guard's uniform,

580
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,234
My trust would be blown to bits.

581
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:37,208
The bugger!

582
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,860
He would shatter into a thousand pieces within me.

583
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,475
You're insulting him?

584
00:32:41,475 --> 00:32:43,360
When the tormented can't curse,

585
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,270
They utter insults!

586
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,280
You'd be right in saying that.

587
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,914
Just tell me

588
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:52,001
How he looked in the uniform.

589
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,160
Oh!

590
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,842
He's fair,

591
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,970
And with a blue uniform!

592
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,045
The bilghter would show such a contrast!

593
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,718
The sissy looks hideous!

594
00:33:02,718 --> 00:33:05,267
He has a gun, too?

595
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:08,410
Obviously! A security guard has a gun.

596
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,280
Good Lord!

597
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,959
Why are you saying 'Good Lord'?

598
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,632
He's the first soldier in love's legion!

599
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:17,048
He's not a soldier; the bugger's a servant!

600
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:19,377
He gets up to salute the toffs.

601
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:20,970
It's a habit with him.

602
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,940
He's Molvi Subhanallah's son,

603
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,770
He must've taught him

604
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,425
To greet even enemies and wish them peace.

605
00:33:27,425 --> 00:33:29,620
Did he wish you peace?

606
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,640
Wouldn't Daniyal have fired him if he'd not done so?

607
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,787
Who's this bugger Daniyal?

608
00:33:35,787 --> 00:33:38,445
Please don't call Daniyal a bugger.

609
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:40,146
He's my friend.

610
00:33:40,146 --> 00:33:42,216
Where are you right now?

611
00:33:42,216 --> 00:33:43,976
At my office?

612
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:45,930
Go to M. Daniyal's office right now.

613
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,240
Why?

614
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,907
I've told you to keep an eye, haven't I?

615
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,458
Don't let the blighter go anywhere.

616
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:52,690
He won't go anywhere.

617
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,770
Cads like him may desert a girl,

618
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,814
But never a job.

619
00:33:57,814 --> 00:33:59,143
You're right there...

620
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:01,818
That's why he's left me...

621
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:03,628
You're in regret, right?

622
00:34:03,628 --> 00:34:05,344
A lot.

623
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:09,360
But you don't quite understand girls' problem.

624
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,228
Hey!

625
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:11,757
What's the problem now?

626
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:15,033
I want to see the blighter in a blue uniform for the last time!

627
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,641
It kills me to think

628
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:20,130
What the bugger would be looking like!

629
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,160
I like it when you insult him.

630
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,582
Just wait and see,

631
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:28,470
Watch out for every four-letter-word I'd say to him when I've got hold of him!

632
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,770
Then, I promise you, Farah Ibrahim,

633
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,470
I won't let him go anywhere.

634
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,450
He'd be there until you've got your hands on him.

635
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,300
Swear by me.

636
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,390
I swear by your head.

637
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,550
So sweet of you.

638
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,020
I'll disconnect.

639
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,390
Hold on!

640
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,880
Don't disconnect just yet.

641
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,410
Do you want to say something?

642
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,065
Just tell me

643
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:52,348
Whose number would you call from the next time?

644
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,771
I swear by you,

645
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:58,730
I'd call using my own number the next time.

646
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,700
Bye.

647
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,516
The engagement may have been temporarily broken, but that does not mean I'd forget you.

648
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:29,960
Whatever are you, mate?

649
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,988
Working as a security guard, dreaming of marrying Farah Ibrahim?

650
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,200
I'm having an office just as big as this one built.

651
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,830
If you want, you can leave this job and come to me for work.

652
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,860
I'll even give you a raise.

653
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,122
Thank you, sir.

654
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:29,010
How much do you earn?

655
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,894
10,000 a month.

656
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,610
You're a Molvi's son, aren't you?

657
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,990
So, I give you this chance -

658
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,554
Say your prayers.

659
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,190
Time's running out.

660
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,925
You can't say your prayers while I count to ten.

661
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,270
Don't count to ten.

662
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,769
I've said my prayers.

663
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:26,380
Your time's running out, now.

664
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,140
Shoot the bugger!

665
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,059
He's got something going on!

666
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:34,192
He'd kill me if he got out! What are you waiting for? Shoot the bugger!

667
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,000
Afzal!
