1
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:13,983
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,983 --> 00:00:18,914
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:24,173
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:30,483
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:36,204
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:41,193
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,439
You're my sister for just a few moments,

8
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,519
Until Dad starts speaking from your mouth.

9
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:39,409
You should remember, too, Afzal,

10
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,159
You're Molvi Subhanallah's son.

11
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:43,969
Go to sleep early.

12
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,819
Dad wants to meet you before noon.

13
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,829
And don't you dare raise your voice.

14
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:53,079
Better stay quiet when inclined to lie.

15
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,800
He's even worried that you may have to suffer for your lies.

16
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:02,219
Take the cup.

17
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,191
What are you doing?

18
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,048
I won't let go.

19
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:22,388
What's the big deal now?

20
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,238
At the very least, I can hold your hand.

21
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,190
Let go!

22
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,878
I'm getting angry!

23
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,028
I don't fear your fury.

24
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:33,218
And I never will after 15th December.

25
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:35,708
Let go! What if someone sees --

26
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,728
What's the big deal with that?

27
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:40,158
They'll just think of it as our expression of love.

28
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:42,298
No, it's not that.

29
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,693
Let's meet tonight?

30
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,688
Tonight?

31
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:47,358
Hush! The walls have ears.

32
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:50,188
On the terrace?

33
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,068
Yes, on the terrace.

34
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:53,748
Let go now!

35
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:56,628
When?

36
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:59,098
Nine o'clock!

37
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,308
Why not eight?

38
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,233
D -- Dad watches the news at nine.

39
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,381
Oh...

40
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,797
You promise?

41
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,660
You tell me.

42
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,077
You promise?

43
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:11,807
You'll be there at nine?

44
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:12,887
Oh

45
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:15,310
I'd be there at eight-thirty.

46
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:16,437
Ohhh...

47
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,297
When will the night fall,

48
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,587
And when will it finally be nine...

49
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,182
Come here.

50
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:39,643
I was listening tales of her childhood shenanigans.

51
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:41,005
God forgive.

52
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:43,232
She used to hold the dog by his ears!

53
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:44,472
Hey!

54
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:46,702
I never knew there were such dogs --

55
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:47,632
I mean --

56
00:04:47,673 --> 00:04:49,905
The kind that'd let you hold them by the ear?

57
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,312
She's talking about puppies.

58
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,672
Oh.

59
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:56,474
Thank you.

60
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,264
Mum, we're not leaving this evening.

61
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,190
Why?

62
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,404
I've got to meet someone at 9 p.m.

63
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:13,254
Here in Hydarabad? With whom?

64
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,160
Mum, you know one of my friends --

65
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,500
With him.

66
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:19,044
Leave it, he must be having plans.

67
00:05:19,044 --> 00:05:20,671
You can leave tomorrow morning.

68
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,750
Yes Mum, we'll leave tomorrow.

69
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,031
Is she still asleep?

70
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,672
No, she's just a bit coy.

71
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,415
Hold it right there.

72
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:46,264
Do you know

73
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,484
He's told everyone about the meeting tonight.

74
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:49,634
What?

75
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,330
Yes.

76
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:54,734
Said he's got to meet someone tonight at nine before Dad.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,160
The blighter!

78
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,370
Don't call him a blighter like that.

79
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:01,254
He's not said whom he's meeting tonight.

80
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,200
I'm calling him a blighter because

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,740
He grabbed me by the hand in the morning.

82
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:07,594
And refused to let go.

83
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:10,084
Stop laughing.

84
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:12,515
I felt that I should hold the meeting right at that moment.

85
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:14,795
Bring him to the terrace and drop the bombshell on him.

86
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:16,667
Please don't do this.

87
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,195
There's an elegance and decorum even when it comes to breaking hearts.

88
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:20,737
Piece by piece,

89
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,184
Slowly,

90
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,187
One subtle blow,

91
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,325
Then another.

92
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,818
And anyway,

93
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,160
Science hasn't verified something like 'broken hearts'.

94
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,988
Without proper precautions,

95
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,119
It can shatter like a glass pane.

96
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,454
Then I'll break it in a manner

97
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,756
That verifies your claim scientifically.

98
00:06:35,756 --> 00:06:37,197
Oh God!

99
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:41,056
At first glance, he looked like a real gentleman.

100
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:44,527
Now, he seems neither gentle nor a man!

101
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:49,027
Mind your anger until 9 p.m.

102
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:52,026
Or Mum will think you're about to wage a war!

103
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,596
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you too.

104
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,267
Don't bring me along into the market, Molvi Sahab...

105
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,847
He'll come to know.

106
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:04,147
I swear by you, he'd kill me.

107
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,570
Do not fear anyone if you're doing something good.

108
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,430
I'm right here.

109
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:12,260
I won't let any harm befall you.

110
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,587
And upon you, peace.

111
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:15,656
So what do I have to do?

112
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,626
Come with me to him.

113
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:20,046
And say without fear what he's done.

114
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,297
Before him?

115
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:24,047
To his face.

116
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,016
And

117
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:29,396
Those letters you used to listen to

118
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,626
Do you remember

119
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:34,626
Any of what the girl used to write to him?

120
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,377
In most letters, she just writes,

121
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,390
'I'll die without you'.

122
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,060
God forgive!

123
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,093
Where does she live?

124
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:45,422
In this city, apparently.

125
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,532
Because he only has her letters.

126
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:49,432
No envelopes.

127
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,652
She lives nearby, so to speak...

128
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,891
Yes...

129
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,731
May I go now, Molvi Sahab?

130
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,921
I told you to go to him,

131
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,160
And present every piece of evidence.

132
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,780
No, Molvi Sahab.

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,790
If I go before him -- I'd deny everything -- I'd swear

134
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,070
That I never said anything.

135
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,250
God curses the liars!

136
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,259
Where are you off to now?

137
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,616
If you believe what I said, it ends thus --

138
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:19,909
Else just think as if I lied to you.

139
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:20,999
He doesn't gamble,

140
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,020
Doesn't smoke weed --

141
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,770
Nor does a girl write letters to him --

142
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,770
Listen --

143
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,830
Listen to me!

144
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,170
The boorish --

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,129
And upon you, peace.

146
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,941
May you live long.

147
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,379
I can guess about the local matches.

148
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:39,219
But who broke the news of the India-Pakistan match to him?

149
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,900
And -- to the devil with the matches!

150
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,040
He even knows about the letters.

151
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,941
How can it be?

152
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,330
It's been Sir Timmy!

153
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:50,439
He knows everything.

154
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,493
He didn't name my friends,

155
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:53,799
But he mentioned it all.

156
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,010
'Reads out her letters to his friends'!

157
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,680
You're doubting me?

158
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,340
You're talking about doubt?

159
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,900
My friendship is at stake.

160
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:04,341
Alladio!

161
00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:06,421
Don't talk about Alladio.

162
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,860
Lad's a selfless servant.

163
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,641
You're accusing him because he's poor?

164
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,262
It must've been Sajid.

165
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,010
No --

166
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,010
Why would Sajid tell?

167
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:17,672
Alright, disconnect the phone.

168
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,151
Dad's here.

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,460
The meeting's about to start.

170
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:27,980
Peace be upon you.

171
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,219
And upon you, peace.

172
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,889
Talk as a father.

173
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:40,719
Not a Molvi.

174
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:45,950
Call him.

175
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,550
Call him here.

176
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,111
Would you like some water?

177
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,974
I said call him here.

178
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,670
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

179
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,590
Strange.

180
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,894
He's fearing me

181
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:32,504
And I him...

182
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,805
Tell him to come.

183
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:38,304
I've come without evidence.

184
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,584
I'll talk differently.

185
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,670
Peace be upon you, Dad.

186
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,059
And upon you, peace.

187
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,162
Come.

188
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,279
Sit.

189
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,809
And you may leave.

190
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,240
Shut the door.

191
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,460
Arifa was telling me you were fearing me.

192
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,130
I was happy.

193
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,741
Why were you fearing me?

194
00:11:27,003 --> 00:11:28,752
It's nothing like that.

195
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,530
Yesterday, you'd mentioned gambling --

196
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,140
Weed --

197
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,540
I was ashamed of myself.

198
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,340
I was afraid

199
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,590
About how I could answer what you'd ask.

200
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:46,683
And you forgot the one about writing letters to that girl.

201
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,063
Anyway.

202
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:51,533
That chapter has closed by itself.

203
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,694
I found no evidence of any of it.

204
00:11:56,795 --> 00:12:01,204
The poor devil who'd informed me

205
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,390
Didn't agree to testify.

206
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,260
The poor soul ran away, frightened of you.

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,940
You're henceforth acquitted of all three accusations.

208
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,770
So rejoice.

209
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,900
You're - God be praised - acquitted

210
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,800
I've got to answer for my crimes.

211
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,441
My mother's no more,

212
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,470
Else I'd have been acquitted too.

213
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,769
What have you done, Dad?

214
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:43,510
I'm guilty of

215
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,371
Raising my dear child by rightful means.

216
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:52,540
There's another crime.

217
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:56,461
You've achieved renown in the neighbourhood,

218
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,537
And I'm helpless before you.

219
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,970
And thus I've decided to spend the rest of my days

220
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,262
In the seclusion of the Mosque.

221
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,061
No Dad...

222
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:13,900
Not in seclusion.

223
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:15,951
You'll stay at home.

224
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,950
I cannot stay here.

225
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,540
Why not?

226
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,221
Because you're here.

227
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:29,590
And because of you, I fear what fate awaits me.

228
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,270
Ruqaiyya!

229
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,070
Ruqaiyya!

230
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:41,673
Stop leaning against the door and come inside.

231
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,810
Listen to me.

232
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,490
Blessed be you.

233
00:13:57,444 --> 00:14:02,440
I have failed to find evidence against your son.

234
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,190
I am ashamed of myself

235
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,970
And therefore leaving this house for the seclusion of the Mosque.

236
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:17,690
Pack the essentials and give me leave.

237
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,130
What are you talking about, Molvi Sahab?

238
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,980
You'd said it yourself

239
00:14:23,221 --> 00:14:25,320
'Talk as a father'.

240
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,660
Now you bear witness,

241
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:31,121
I have talked as a father.

242
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:36,851
I'm exiling the Molvi to the seclusion of the Mosque.

243
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,666
Go!

244
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,527
Fall at his feet!

245
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:46,616
With your head at his feet, apologise!

246
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:49,278
Dad!

247
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,277
Forgive me for all my sins!

248
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:53,689
For God's sake, forgive me!

249
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,950
Right.

250
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,199
First, offer your noon prayers.

251
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,889
We'll talk later.

252
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:38,288
See?

253
00:15:38,288 --> 00:15:40,556
He hasn't completely forgiven you.

254
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:41,996
But he will.

255
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,823
Purify yourself

256
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:47,343
And stand in the foremost rank.

257
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:49,823
That's what he's hinted at!

258
00:15:51,054 --> 00:15:52,383
Go!

259
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:16,946
It's you!

260
00:16:18,474 --> 00:16:20,185
Headed for the Mosque?

261
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:21,277
Yes.

262
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,063
When did this day come?

263
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,054
Today.

264
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,804
Dad said, offer your prayers, or else --

265
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:26,816
Or else?

266
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,553
I -- I'm getting late.

267
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:33,417
You're out on the streets,

268
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,336
Don't laugh like this.

269
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,772
The bloke you were talking to

270
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,878
He's a known ruffian.

271
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,218
No --

272
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,987
He's gone to pray.

273
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,010
Don't turn to look back like this, look ahead.

274
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,620
It's not proper for girls to do so.

275
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,138
What is this, Aunt?

276
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,859
He's my best friend's brother.

277
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:54,089
Molvi Subhanallah's son.

278
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,702
You don't know

279
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,748
But Alladio tells me everything.

280
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:59,469
He's with those yobs

281
00:16:59,469 --> 00:17:01,279
Gambling --

282
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:03,968
And who knows what else!

283
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,479
He might,

284
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,309
But he's going to pray now.

285
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,509
Peace and Mercy of God upon you.

286
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:34,760
Peace and Mercy of God upon you.

287
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:40,010
There is no God but God.

288
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:47,062
Hear me, O God...

289
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,922
I begin in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

290
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:57,672
You are Peace, and from You is Peace.

291
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,383
Amen!

292
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:02,472
Give us our lives in Your surrender, and admit into the Safety of Your Peace.

293
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,452
You are the Most Praised, the Most Sublime.

294
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,004
The Lord of Majesty and Bounty.

295
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:16,812
And blessings of God be upon Mohammad and his companions.

296
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,169
And hit him so hard,

297
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,270
The very sight of her makes his forehead sweat.

298
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:32,769
Must've hit him on the forehead!

299
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,171
Come in.

300
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,728
Is the stitching done, will it be done tomorrow?

301
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,709
What are you doing? Get your hands off!

302
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,301
What were you doing?

303
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:28,054
Just kidding.

304
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,910
And I will do so after our marriage too.

305
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,380
Why did you come in my room?

306
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,440
You'd said, 'Come in'.

307
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,717
Oh God.

308
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:41,000
Get out.

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,437
Out!

310
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:43,997
This isn't right.

311
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,704
You get angry every now and then.

312
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,764
And I --

313
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:51,203
I've been waiting for 9 p.m. since the morning.

314
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:54,573
Nothing can change our plan for 9 p.m.

315
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:55,306
I swear.

316
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:58,371
I'll not be a minute late.

317
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:01,164
I was getting bored alone

318
00:20:01,164 --> 00:20:05,044
And thought if a little meeting before the night --

319
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:09,013
Hey!

320
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,097
Splendid!

321
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:15,061
Nothing so splendid.

322
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:16,785
I'm leaving.

323
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,365
Chap sneaked into the room.

324
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:28,022
I thought it was you.

325
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,611
Anyway.

326
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:31,686
Are the dresses ready or will they be 'tomorrow'?

327
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,566
Not tomorrow, the day after.

328
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,163
He said he was cutting vegetables with his wife when he cut his hand.

329
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,476
Splendid!

330
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:53,862
What?

331
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:54,817
Nothing.

332
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:56,611
I said nothing.

333
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:05,155
Come.

334
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:10,863
Here.

335
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,092
Dad --

336
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,430
Why have you brought me here.

337
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,411
I swear that thing about the letters is false.

338
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,345
I swear by you!

339
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:22,269
Who mentioned the letters?

340
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,254
I talked to Monseigneur.

341
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:28,469
Saw him praying and told him about you.

342
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:32,184
He leard about your BA qualification and said, 'Bring him to me'.

343
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:33,557
'I'll give him a job'.

344
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,065
Come. Come here.

345
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,972
Come here.

346
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,220
Tell me, how big is your heart?

347
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,049
See for yourself.

348
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,140
The fact is,

349
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,518
I'm afraid.

350
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:02,062
Dishonour may create a problem.

351
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:04,486
We're the kind who'd die for honour.

352
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,340
Times have changed.

353
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,861
People compromise on honour a little.

354
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,847
Perhaps.

355
00:23:13,474 --> 00:23:15,231
But why are we talking about this?

356
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,988
Let's talk about something else.

357
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:19,247
Right --

358
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,366
What did I start on --

359
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,613
I think we have an understanding.

360
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,466
Should I say it?

361
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:28,765
What?

362
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:32,136
Please don't be disturbed to hear it.

363
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:35,184
I won't be. Promise.

364
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,967
It's bad.

365
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,729
But best told.

366
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:42,714
If such things come out in the open after the marriage,

367
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,026
Even lovers get divorced.

368
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:47,013
God forgive!

369
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,136
Place your hand over your heart.

370
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,960
Place your hand!

371
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,736
The thing is

372
00:23:58,047 --> 00:24:00,907
I love someone else, Mehtab.

373
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:03,584
Since childhood

374
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,691
He was a classmate.

375
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:09,411
We used to write letters everyday,

376
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:12,173
And now, we talk for hours over the phone.

377
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:15,503
He says, 'I'll die without you'.

378
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:17,127
And

379
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:20,375
Before the date was fixed, I used to say the same.

380
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:22,157
But now, it seems

381
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:25,642
I have to sacrifice my first love for Dad's sake.

382
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:29,953
You must be feeling very bad,

383
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,520
But --
-No.

384
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,330
I don't feel bad at all.

385
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,321
Rather, I'm chuffed to see

386
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:40,524
That you didn't conceal your past like other girls.

387
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,455
You've got courage.

388
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,540
Said it all to my face.

389
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:49,890
I swear by you,

390
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,630
I admire you even more now.

391
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,250
I'm proud of you.

392
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,150
Everything about honour aside,

393
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,390
Your past is none of my concern.

394
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,983
Was this the compromise you were talking about?

395
00:25:30,383 --> 00:25:33,757
Hey -- Wait -- Wha -- Ruined the sleeve there!

396
00:25:33,901 --> 00:25:36,583
Look, Mum! My sharp dressed brother!

397
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:37,776
God bless!

398
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,416
Ward the evil eye off him!

399
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,695
Do I look good?

400
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:43,966
Sightly, I swear!

401
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,916
It's 'as God has willed'!

402
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,884
Ward the evil eye off him.

403
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:54,102
Do anything you want to, many eyes will be fixed on him today!

404
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,354
Look at him, Dad!

405
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:02,451
I am looking.

406
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,082
This is how gentlemen look. Just perfect!

407
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:08,297
Right. Turn away.

408
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:13,484
Don't stay before my eyes too long like this.

409
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:18,958
And as he leaves, have him walk under the Qur'an.

410
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,513
It's his first day at the office.

411
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,954
And

412
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,038
The bloke looks sightly indeed!

413
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,840
Don't look back if a sweetheart looks at you.

414
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,160
These looks could kill!

415
00:26:32,528 --> 00:26:34,946
God is happy with me

416
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:36,914
Or perhaps

417
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,729
With you, Ruqaiyya.

418
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,873
To be honest, Dad

419
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:44,734
He is happy with me.

420
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,484
I'd prayed with tears in my eyes that day.

421
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,328
Like this.

422
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,910
With my hands folded

423
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,972
Saying,

424
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:55,738
If the noon meeting does not bring good news,

425
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:57,442
I will be found making up for omitted prayers.

426
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,801
God forgive you!

427
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,883
Threatened God?

428
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:03,786
Where's the threat in this?

429
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:07,787
If, angry with you, I say that I'll not eat, is it a threat?

430
00:27:07,787 --> 00:27:10,754
It'll be a threat when I won't do something for you.

431
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,662
Which I do without failure.

432
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:14,459
Yours and His.

433
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,129
Alright, don't list your favours.

434
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:20,523
And don't reason in ignorance.

435
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:24,204
And you just have a jolly time standing.

436
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:28,716
Pack him bread and an egg for lunch.

437
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:29,743
Alright.

438
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:33,192
He'll be there until five!

439
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,370
Come.

440
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,215
Go.

441
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:54,257
Keep the bag in the car.

442
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,239
Hey!

443
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:01,149
Where are you going?

444
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,901
You'd said she's not coming to see me off.

445
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,213
Obviously.

446
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:09,980
How can she come to see you off with Dad standing there?

447
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,559
That's why I was going upstairs.

448
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,768
She might be crying.

449
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
What?

450
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,004
It's just that

451
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:19,233
The moment of goodbyes

452
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:22,471
Is a fatal one for lovers.

453
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:26,049
And this restriction on seeing me off

454
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:30,166
What state must she be in?

455
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:34,891
Aunt's in the car and Mum and Dad are waiting for you.

456
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:36,588
What's she doing?

457
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:38,780
Anyway.

458
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,701
That's not something I need to ask.

459
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:42,984
She must be distressed.

460
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,608
Don't look up.

461
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:49,814
Dad often finds excuses to check.

462
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:51,292
Sorry, but

463
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:54,500
His habits are 1913-ish even in 2013.

464
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:55,989
But anyway,

465
00:28:55,989 --> 00:28:59,049
Tell her it'll be like this after the marriage too.

466
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:01,881
Will she trouble herself weeping and wailing like this?

467
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:05,240
I may even have to go somewhere for eight to ten days.

468
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,189
I'll tell her.

469
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:13,184
And also tell her it's a mere four months until December.

470
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,545
Here I go,

471
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,420
And there comes December.

472
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,830
God willing...

473
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:22,477
Alright.

474
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:25,444
One more thing.

475
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:28,847
A secret

476
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:32,227
Tell her

477
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:35,223
Not to talk unnecessarily over the phone.

478
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:37,819
What do you mean?

479
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:41,588
I can't tell you the whole thing.

480
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:44,520
Just tell her indirectly

481
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,333
To let bygones be bygones.

482
00:29:58,937 --> 00:29:59,953
Stop!

483
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:01,999
Wait.

484
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,295
Yes.

485
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:06,827
Now, begin in the name of God,

486
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:08,977
Bow your head, and walk on.

487
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:11,164
Wait a second!

488
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,140
You left your lunch box here.

489
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:15,827
Dad!

490
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,547
He said the tie and the lunch box didn't match well enough.

491
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:21,206
Won't leave a good impression.

492
00:30:21,206 --> 00:30:23,469
One who submits to God

493
00:30:23,469 --> 00:30:28,597
Leaves an impression with his humility, my dear.

494
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,315
He has humility, Molvi Sahab.

495
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:33,299
He's doing his duty.

496
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,140
Will he be humble only if he has his lunch box?

497
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:39,474
Go, my child.

498
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,000
In the name of God.

499
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,503
Go.

500
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,278
O God, the Most Exalted.

501
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:54,560
Oh!

502
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:59,446
Overjoyed at him having gotten a job, I forgot to ask... What's his rank?

503
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,600
And how much will he earn?

504
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:04,059
He's appointed as a clerk,

505
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,857
And will earn 10,000.

506
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:07,906
That's it?

507
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:13,046
You made him a clerk...

508
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:17,448
With third division all the way from matric [GCSEs] to BA,

509
00:31:17,448 --> 00:31:20,387
Monseigneur has been generous enough

510
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:24,236
To not ask about experience

511
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:26,114
Else I'd have said,

512
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,779
He's a proper gambler.

513
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,979
And he, too, can see so well through a man,

514
00:31:32,979 --> 00:31:35,606
As to have him in the accounts department!

515
00:31:35,606 --> 00:31:38,136
God is great indeed!

516
00:31:39,115 --> 00:31:42,849
If the noon prayer had its effect,

517
00:31:42,849 --> 00:31:44,585
He will prosper,

518
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:48,143
Or else it'll be another albatross around my neck.

519
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:50,648
My neck

520
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:54,754
And his tie make such a combination!

521
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,330
It's only four months until December.

522
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,350
They shall pass.

523
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,780
My foot!

524
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,002
Don't trouble yourself weeping and wailing.

525
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:15,456
What?

526
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,290
Farah Mehtab sounds so good!

527
00:32:22,088 --> 00:32:24,941
And you sound so bad!

528
00:32:26,942 --> 00:32:28,380
You can have it in writing.

529
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,367
The December shall never come

530
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:33,353
When Farah Ibrahim will get married to Mehtab Chawla.

531
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:37,051
Or so it can be said that 2013 will end with 11 months.

532
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,985
For the first time, there will be no December in a year!

533
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,020
Bye!

534
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,048
Hey, Afzal!

535
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Right there, old chap, complete with trews, shirt and a tie!

536
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:53,308
Who decked you up?

537
00:32:53,308 --> 00:32:54,883
What do you mean?

538
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:56,583
I deck myself up.

539
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:58,055
You're going on a date!

540
00:32:58,055 --> 00:32:59,413
I'm going to the office.

541
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:00,637
Office?

542
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:02,706
You know Sheikh Ibrahim Cotton Mills?

543
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,852
I'm the Accounts Officer.

544
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:06,644
Sheikh Ibrahim?

545
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:08,457
Leave Sheikh Ibrahim.

546
00:33:08,457 --> 00:33:10,437
I'm an officer!

547
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:13,534
What a spunky lassie his is --

548
00:33:15,263 --> 00:33:16,825
Whom are you talking about?

549
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,888
Don't show your depravity.

550
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,874
Think of people's daughters as your sisters.

551
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:23,618
Third division in matric [GCSEs],

552
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:25,825
Third division in inter [A-Levels],

553
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:27,947
Third division in BA,

554
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:30,103
And your name?

555
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,040
Afzal [The Excellent One] Subhanallah.

556
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,654
Subhanallah Afzal [The Splendid Afzal] suits you better.

557
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,490
Subhanallah is my father's name.

558
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,542
Experience?

559
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:43,544
Zero.

560
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,463
No third division here?

561
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,182
I've not started work that would gain me experience.

562
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:53,872
Why has Monseigneur appointed you?

563
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:55,766
On my father's recommendation.

564
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:57,177
Who is your father?

565
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,910
He's a priest at the Mosque.

566
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,820
He leads Monseigneur's prayers.

567
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,710
Oh...

568
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,163
Miss Rosy!

569
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:09,773
Yes?

570
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:12,116
Take Mr Subhanallah Afzal

571
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:14,304
Have him sit by you,

572
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,665
And show him how to fill a voucher.

573
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:20,419
Just filling vouchers?

574
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,310
Teach him whatever he can learn.

575
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:26,414
Alright.

576
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:27,214
Come.

577
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:28,522
Go.

578
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,130
Sit.

579
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,190
Come a bit closer to me.

580
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:38,773
Yes?

581
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:43,725
I said come a bit closer, so that I can show you how to fill a voucher.

582
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,361
Alright.

583
00:35:56,212 --> 00:35:58,715
Mr Chengezi was insulting you so bad.

584
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,807
Didn't you feel angry?

585
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,447
A bit.

586
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:06,384
But you were smiling.

587
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:08,961
Do you know why?

588
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,290
Why?

589
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:15,347
One day, I will insult him.

590
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,520
Back to work now.

591
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,630
Who is it?

592
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,677
Lubna!
-How are you?

593
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:35,471
Come in.
-Take this; come back after an hour.

594
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,669
If it isn't our sweet Lubna!

595
00:36:39,669 --> 00:36:40,870
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

596
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,359
And upon you, peace.

597
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:43,464
How are you?

598
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:45,436
You're here after months.

599
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,996
I have brought sweets for you.

600
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,622
Sweets? Why?

601
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:50,313
Something related to a marriage.

602
00:36:50,313 --> 00:36:52,105
Yes.
-Isn't it?

603
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:53,748
Marriage?

604
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,199
You're so shameless!

605
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,777
You're telling us when you bring us sweets?

606
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:57,814
Whom are you getting married to?

607
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,498
Ask who's getting married first!

608
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:02,293
Farah?

609
00:37:02,293 --> 00:37:03,499
Yes.

610
00:37:04,581 --> 00:37:07,440
Thank goodness she has found someone.

611
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,126
Sit down and talk,

612
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,092
I'll get some tea.

613
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:17,866
First have some sweets,

614
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:20,271
Then I'll tell you the bitter reality.

615
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,786
I've had sweets, now tell me!

616
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:22,806
Stay easy, girl!

617
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,585
Let the sweets sink in!

618
00:37:24,753 --> 00:37:26,251
Let's go inside.

619
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,450
Now you fill this voucher.

620
00:37:34,234 --> 00:37:37,621
Say, Ibrahim Cottons sold cloth worth 1,000,000

621
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,232
And the buyer gave a cheque of 1,000,000.

622
00:37:40,698 --> 00:37:43,338
This white one is the debit voucher.

623
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:44,826
It's written on it,

624
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:47,364
But because of the white colour,

625
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,600
It can be seen

626
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,925
Rather easily.

627
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:52,852
The bank is the debit and sales are the credit.

628
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:53,910
Now

629
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,850
Fill a debit voucher.

630
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,247
Fill it.

631
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:18,537
Are you married?

632
00:38:21,945 --> 00:38:23,367
You didn't mention this --

633
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:25,834
I'm asking this.

634
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,130
Tell me if you're married.

635
00:38:29,294 --> 00:38:30,843
No.

636
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,330
Not yet.

637
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,650
Then there's a lot I can teach you.

638
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,964
Don't answer the phone.

639
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:43,984
Mr Chengezi minds it.

640
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:47,079
And he can't take personal calls at all.

641
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,782
What does he do if he can't take it?

642
00:38:52,334 --> 00:38:53,708
Yes Babloo?

643
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,004
7 p.m. sharp.

644
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:56,076
What is it?

645
00:38:56,076 --> 00:38:58,145
A match against the old colony lads.

646
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,461
Floodlight.

647
00:39:01,036 --> 00:39:02,683
Why are you laughing?

648
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:05,292
I can't play.

649
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:06,891
Can't play?

650
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:08,802
What's this guff?

651
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:10,335
I've put 50,000 on the line.

652
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:12,614
10,000 for you if we win.

653
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,973
Shut up!

654
00:39:14,094 --> 00:39:16,050
No more matches now.

655
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:17,940
I've started working now.

656
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,271
I'm on duty.

657
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:21,176
You're doing this for more cash, eh, bugger?

658
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:22,098
Alright

659
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,174
15,000 for you.

660
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:25,674
That okay?
-I won't agree even to 20.

661
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:28,281
Now, disconnect the call.

662
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,572
It --

663
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,991
Was a friend.

664
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:36,163
A punter.

665
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:37,804
Gambles on matches.

666
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:40,050
Think of this as the last call you answered in this office!

667
00:39:40,063 --> 00:39:41,343
No, sir.

668
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:42,952
This was the first call.

669
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:44,831
Miss Rosy, tell him!

670
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:49,279
Tell him how to behave in the office before teaching him how to fill vouchers!

671
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:53,168
I'd warned you.

672
00:39:53,168 --> 00:39:54,967
Didn't you see him

673
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,439
Crawl back?

674
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,141
The crab.

675
00:40:00,372 --> 00:40:05,372
