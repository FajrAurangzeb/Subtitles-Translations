1
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:13,885
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:19,095
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:19,095 --> 00:00:24,180
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,463
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:36,081
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:40,825
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,647
Have some tea, my dear.

8
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,799
I'm sure she'd have talked to you about pursuing her MPhil in London.

9
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,478
Yes.

10
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes, she has.

11
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,407
What did you say?

12
00:01:51,949 --> 00:01:52,792
I said,

13
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:54,267
'Alright, thank you'.

14
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,648
She should've been the one to say 'Thank you'.

15
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:59,145
I thanked her because she asked me.

16
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,559
Oh...

17
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:02,539
Good...

18
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:05,324
Excuse me.

19
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,309
My sister's calling me.

20
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:14,713
Hello?

21
00:02:14,713 --> 00:02:16,542
Yes, how's it going?

22
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,315
You're still awake?

23
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:19,696
I'm asking you how it's going.

24
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,674
Have you succeeded?

25
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:23,627
Succeeded?

26
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,284
The meeting's going on.

27
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:28,569
It'll be over in a while.

28
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,219
You're hiding something.

29
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,528
I'll be back -- In a while.

30
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:35,978
Sorry.

31
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:37,629
If I don't answer her call,

32
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,267
She gets angry over it.

33
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:42,033
So, you were saying

34
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,037
She'll be pursuing her MPhil in London?

35
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,103
We'd talked about that, old chap.

36
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,752
Tell me - if the marriage is indeed fixed,

37
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,376
Would you go to London?

38
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,396
Not at all --
-But of course!

39
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:53,941
You've just said yes inside!

40
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,351
That you'd go along!

41
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,616
I would, of course,

42
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:01,622
But it doesn't seem nice

43
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:03,487
That the wife goes to London for her studies,

44
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:07,230
And the husband follows her around like a bodyguard.

45
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,082
My conscience doesn't quite allow me.

46
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,857
But I've agreed to.

47
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,299
That's like a man.

48
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:20,171
Alright, then. See you tomorrow morning at 9 at the office.

49
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,436
Hear good news as you leave that we are both very pleased to meet you.

50
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:26,514
And we

51
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:29,680
Have no objections to this marriage.

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,950
Thank you, sir.

53
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,322
Tell her, too.

54
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:42,386
She'll be delighted too!

55
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:43,810
Alright.

56
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,675
Who can it be?

57
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,066
Young lady,

58
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,614
Would you see who it is?

59
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,905
I'll take my leave.

60
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,221
Best of luck.

61
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,535
Thank you, sir.

62
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:00,965
I'll ask the driver to leave you --
-No, sir.

63
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:02,872
It's just about four streets away to my home.

64
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,911
I'll go myself.

65
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,541
I've told her.

66
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,226
She's delighted to hear.

67
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,950
Goodbye, my dear.
-Goodbye.

68
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,909
What happened?

69
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,249
It's him again!

70
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:26,279
Who's there again?

71
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,442
The same who'd come before.

72
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,037
Tell me his name.

73
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,112
I don't quite remember his name.

74
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,260
Peace be upon you.

75
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:39,228
And upon you, peace...

76
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:45,579
Please have the outer gate opened; the car's parked outside.

77
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,238
Go.

78
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:48,020
Open the gate.

79
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:52,476
She dashed inside the moment she saw me.

80
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,381
He's --

81
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,024
Mehtab Bhai.

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,230
Who's this?

83
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,047
Afzal.

84
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,250
Alright, Afzal, you may leave.

85
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,610
Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,760
Same here.

87
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,240
What is it this time?

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,613
He's come.

89
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,882
Wh --

90
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,903
Perhaps it is that you want to say,

91
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:42,559
'He's left'?

92
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,697
Not at all.

93
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm saying 'He's come'.

94
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,126
With his Mum!

95
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:48,439
Hey!

96
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,074
His Mum's here too!

97
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,262
Would you care to ask whom I'm talking about?

98
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:55,857
Who are you talking about?

99
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:57,511
Mehtab Chawla.

100
00:05:57,511 --> 00:05:59,120
His Mum's with him,

101
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,088
And both of them have such expressions

102
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:03,468
As the spectral undead!

103
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:04,666
In fact,

104
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,702
In fact, if Dad declined a second time,

105
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,072
Aunt Shugufta would be no more.

106
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:13,778
Why would he be any more, the spalpeen!
-Look at his face.

107
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,936
He doesn't need to die a second time.

108
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:18,964
It would be better if you get some rest tonight.

109
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,181
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

110
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,480
All tranquility's been burnt to ashes, Monseigneur.

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,185
Would you look at him?

112
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,243
He's not slept for three days!

113
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:29,029
Ain't right, my dear.

114
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,460
It's important to get some sleep.

115
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,419
Why don't you

116
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,898
Give him that pill --

117
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:35,562
Whatsit --

118
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,404
Leave the name.

119
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,747
If he takes one now,

120
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:41,496
He'll wake up tomorrow in the afternoon, all fresh!

121
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:43,278
I have it with me; should I get it?

122
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,864
I've gotten him many pills,

123
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,591
Begged him day and night,

124
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:48,675
'Take one, my dear'.

125
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,281
'If you sleep for a while, you'd find peace'.

126
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,491
But do you know what he said?

127
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:55,010
What?

128
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,902
He said, 'I'd find peace when I'd take a bullet right here in the chest'.

129
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:01,794
Hey!

130
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:04,269
Why are you crying, Madame?

131
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,387
Please, be brave.

132
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,276
Don't ask me to be brave, Monseigneur.

133
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,014
Please change your decision.

134
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:13,969
I told you we'd talk about it tomorrow.

135
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,847
I can beg Farah if you'd rather...

136
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,656
I'll fall at her feet.

137
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:23,189
I'd ask forgiveness of her if he's unknowingly said something wrong to her.

138
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,319
No -- Not at all --

139
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,466
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,754
Monseigneur, we accept every condition of hers.

141
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:31,734
If she wants to go to London for her studies, we have no objections.

142
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:33,716
He won't go along with her.

143
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,391
It's just a matter of two years.

144
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,782
He'll wait.

145
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:40,350
That's fine,

146
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,766
But there's someone else who's going with her.

147
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,001
That's good.

148
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,441
Why should the girl leave the country all alone?

149
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,646
Someone should go along.

150
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:52,272
You're not getting what I'm trying to say...

151
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:55,248
We've decided something else.

152
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:56,578
We've talked about it

153
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,499
And Farah is delighted too.

154
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,895
What have you decided?

155
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:03,515
We'll talk tomorrow.

156
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,178
He doesn't seem well.

157
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:07,484
Mehtab?

158
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,605
Why don't you say something, my dear?

159
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,155
Yes?

160
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,000
Mehtab,

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,070
Have you had anything to eat?

162
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,048
Nothing.

163
00:08:16,048 --> 00:08:17,720
I think he had something the day before yesterday.

164
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,282
What did you have?

165
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,405
Right,

166
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:22,751
I'd gone to the shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi.

167
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,825
I'd received some rice as sacrament,

168
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:28,654
He'd eaten it because he wanted the blessings.

169
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:31,970
He just drinks water now.

170
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,540
Won't you eat something?

171
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,941
Get up.

172
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:43,320
Go and eat something right now.

173
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,650
Get up!

174
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:51,738
Irsa, take him and get him something to eat.

175
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,077
Come, my dear.

176
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:55,908
One doesn't stop eating over such trifles.

177
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,378
Come.

178
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,621
Monseigneur,

179
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:02,324
For the love of God, have some mercy.

180
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:04,863
Look at his condition.

181
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:07,695
I'd said we'd talk about it tomorrow.

182
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:11,648
For now, go and have something to eat, and then get some rest.

183
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:12,613
No...

184
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,843
I'll meet Farah first.

185
00:09:14,843 --> 00:09:17,302
Please, do meet her.

186
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,660
But don't beg before her.

187
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,219
Alright.

188
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:50,707
This is utter harlequinade!

189
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,003
Coming here with his Mum

190
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,973
Now that I've rejected the marriage proposal!

191
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:55,912
Now he'll stay here

192
00:09:55,912 --> 00:09:57,046
Waltz around before everyone,

193
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:58,877
And grab my hand the moment he gets a chance!

194
00:09:58,877 --> 00:09:59,844
Splendid.

195
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:01,318
Why would he grab your hand now?

196
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,270
And if he does indeed by mistake,

197
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,436
Whack him nicely with the same hand!

198
00:10:05,436 --> 00:10:07,394
That option is off the table now!

199
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:09,987
I'll clobber him on the head with something!

200
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:11,352
And create such a scene

201
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,841
That Dad will call the police!

202
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,471
Think about it.

203
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,613
I've thought over it!

204
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,004
Don't look at his face then.
-God forbid!

205
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:22,675
But why are you asking me not to look at his face?

206
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:24,827
You'd have mercy on him.

207
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,661
It's today that I've seen, Farah,

208
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:29,761
What one who's lost in love looks like.

209
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,075
God forgive.

210
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,484
A face that's drooping,

211
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:34,188
A visage devoid of all vigour,

212
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,073
With exanimate eyes...

213
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:37,811
I have to see him once!

214
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:41,011
Not once, but a hundred times.

215
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,846
I've come here to have you see him.

216
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,940
Uh -- A -- Aunt --

217
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,330
I'm sorry...

218
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,833
The thing is --

219
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,272
P -- Please, sit.

220
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:02,387
I'll sit at your feet now that I've come.

221
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:05,325
I'm not leaving with a rejection.

222
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,580
What can I do?

223
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,458
He's my only son!

224
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:13,955
I can't see him languish in love!

225
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,520
Call him a blighter,

226
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,953
Or think of him as an unsuccessful lover,

227
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:25,144
Or say that the very sight of him will sting you;

228
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,084
Say what you will, my dear,

229
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:33,242
But nobody can stop a drowning man from flailing.

230
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,905
But I can assure you

231
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:39,390
He won't grab your hand.

232
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,019
That option is off the table, thanks to you.

233
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:50,338
I've talked to your father

234
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,200
He's said he'll talk tomorrow.

235
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,005
I shall stay awake all night, waiting for tomorrow.

236
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:04,594
Only God knows

237
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:08,296
How he would while the night away...

238
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,182
It's Afzal!

239
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,623
Hello?

240
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,398
Afzal here.

241
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,178
I know. Go on.

242
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,715
I won't go to meet your father in the morning.

243
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:36,223
Bravo!

244
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,348
He's come up with something.

245
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,886
What will you do then?

246
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,902
I'll resign from this job.

247
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,693
Which job?

248
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:45,450
This one

249
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,006
That earns me 200,000 a month.

250
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,911
Why?

251
00:12:50,707 --> 00:12:53,629
I'll not two-time her.

252
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,992
What did he say?

253
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:06,810
He said, 'I'll not two-time her'.

254
00:13:29,046 --> 00:13:30,274
Hello?

255
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,038
What did you just tell Lubna?

256
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:35,018
You'd abandon me right in the middle of the rapids?

257
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,122
Right,

258
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,358
I get it,

259
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,605
You'd have realised

260
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,542
That my boat's about to run aground.

261
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:41,963
So you'd have thought,

262
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,696
'Let's blackmail the girl'!

263
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:45,871
If you wanted a rise,

264
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:47,624
You could've just asked for it!

265
00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:51,466
I squander some 2 to 4 hundred thousand just like that!

266
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,748
Tell me.

267
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,090
How much do you want?

268
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,092
What's your new rate?

269
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:57,376
And remember,

270
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:58,932
I won't let you waver

271
00:13:58,932 --> 00:14:01,447
From the amount that we decide now.

272
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:02,937
Tell me!

273
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:04,951
Go on!

274
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:07,508
He's getting embarrassed now!

275
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:08,723
It's only natural

276
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,587
Considering that he's a Molvi's son!

277
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:12,049
But no problem,

278
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,299
You can demand unrepentantly!

279
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,141
Tell me!

280
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,668
Hey!

281
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,909
He's disconnected the call!

282
00:14:23,168 --> 00:14:24,755
Would he quietly listen

283
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:26,238
As you go on with this ignoble banter?

284
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:27,709
How much have you paid him?

285
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,566
Or is he begging for a penny that you're so scoffing!

286
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,364
You should remember, Mademoiselle Farah Ibrahim,

287
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,632
He's been working without pay so far.

288
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,238
Neither have you given him a penny,

289
00:14:36,238 --> 00:14:37,738
Nor has he asked for one.

290
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,354
The cell phone, suit and boots you'd gotten him was your problem

291
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,727
And not his demand.

292
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,548
Yet, you only need to ask and he'd return all of it.

293
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:48,549
I can assure as much.

294
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,527
Pray tell, then,

295
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,424
What gives you the right to use such harsh expletives?

296
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,417
No such deal was struck, after all,

297
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,121
That he'd be kind to you,

298
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:10,379
And you'd be so lippy with him!

299
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:11,630
So lippy!

300
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,828
To be honest, you're abusing him!

301
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:18,075
I thought he was resigning to get a rise.

302
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,873
Not at all.

303
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,223
He's resigning to be spared all of this.

304
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,478
You hatch up a plot

305
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:25,230
Every five minutes.

306
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,488
And the situation changes

307
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,672
Every sixth minute.

308
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:31,542
What can the poor man do?

309
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:34,344
You work out a plan about 'love' at night,

310
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,678
And expect him to act out his hatred in the morning.

311
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:39,472
It had been decided that he'd love you with all his life for four months.

312
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,610
And you're urging him on the fourth day

313
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,906
To two-time you

314
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:45,193
And be done with it.

315
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:48,354
That's not how it is, Farah.

316
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:51,533
Even a veteran actor can't give such a performance!

317
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,164
But he's still performing

318
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,446
He handles the situation in a moment.

319
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:57,957
Pause and think

320
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,958
You brought him before someone like Dad,

321
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,259
And said to him, 'Prove it that you deserve Farah'.

322
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,744
Has he not proven

323
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:07,432
That he deserves you?

324
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,263
Dad's singing his praises!

325
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:12,006
And a lady like Mum who scorns more when she talks

326
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,534
Has forgotten everything about the poor man's status.

327
00:16:14,534 --> 00:16:16,661
What else can he do?

328
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:19,648
Breathe fire like a dragon?

329
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:22,834
Honestly

330
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:26,097
I was just furious at Mehtab's arrival.

331
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:30,384
And I vented it out on him.

332
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,400
Well,

333
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,409
That works for you.

334
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,868
How does that work for me?

335
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,675
He said he'd not two-time me.

336
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:39,266
He's two-timed you already.

337
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:42,763
When he said he's resigning from the job and going back to his world,

338
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:44,796
It means he's gone from yours.

339
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,540
He's two-timed you.

340
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,970
Now, plan out everything after it.

341
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,056
Weep and wail,

342
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,496
Break your bangles!

343
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:53,411
Rather,

344
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,099
This isn't the occasion to break bangles.

345
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,671
Just weeping will be enough.

346
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:58,706
Withdraw into your room

347
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:00,928
And keep on weeping and wailing!

348
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:02,695
Are you insane?

349
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:06,290
Won't Dad go to his place if I start crying?

350
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,273
He'd kill him!

351
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,998
Think about it this way -

352
00:17:16,998 --> 00:17:18,496
If it happened like this,

353
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,561
How it would strengthen that blighter Mehtab's case!

354
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,057
So what should be done then?

355
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,744
Call him.

356
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,157
What will you say?

357
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,794
I won't say anything.

358
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,313
You should talk to him.

359
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:37,386
Tell him

360
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,782
To not two-time me.

361
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,668
He should go on with his love for now.

362
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:06,505
He's not answering.

363
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:07,648
He must've retired.

364
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,023
Impossible.

365
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,947
One can only die - not sleep - after such humiliation.

366
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,772
Shall we go to the terrace?

367
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,560
What?

368
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,352
I'll spend the night in isolation, doing penance.

369
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,912
I'll call him again and again.

370
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,363
Until the moment he answers

371
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:26,821
And talks to me,

372
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,640
I'll stravaig about the terrace.

373
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,532
Wow...

374
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:32,241
What a way to expiate, mate...

375
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,638
I'm feeling very guilty, Lubna.

376
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:36,484
Until I say sorry to him,

377
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,470
I can't be at peace.

378
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,224
I appreciate that

379
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:41,817
But I'm feeling sleepy, Farah.

380
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:43,891
I have to go to the University in the morning.

381
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,938
How can you leave me here?

382
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,748
Can't you stay awake with me in my sorrow?

383
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,362
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

384
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,206
But I can't be a part of a cabal

385
00:18:52,206 --> 00:18:54,828
Whose chieftain would utterly disgrace someone and say,

386
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,488
'I'm ashamed at what I've done'.

387
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:03,231
I'll talk very sweetly to him now.

388
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,100
I sw --

389
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:09,789
I swear by you.

390
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,181
He'll answer.

391
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,908
Keep on trying.

392
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,750
I think he's taken sleeping pills.

393
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,719
No way.

394
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,264
He's just angry.

395
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,476
Who can sleep

396
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,827
After such humiliation?

397
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,502
Call him.

398
00:19:51,144 --> 00:19:52,375
Okay, wait.

399
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,891
Text him.

400
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:55,107
Write,

401
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,955
'If you don't answer',

402
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,123
'I'll be paying you a visit'.

403
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:00,565
And if he doesn't answer?

404
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:03,659
I'll think the rapscallion's taken sleeping pills and fallen asleep.

405
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,712
Rapscallion?

406
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,451
Hey! I'm saying it affectionately.

407
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,920
Done.

408
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:33,889
Would you look at that!

409
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,380
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:44,790
What could I do?

411
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,897
Look at your watch.

412
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:47,182
It's 2.00 a.m.

413
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:49,712
So it is by your watch.

414
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,395
I'm a rather harmless man, by the way.

415
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:56,987
It doesn't matter to you whether I am here or not.

416
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,588
Please go to your room

417
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:01,120
And sleep peacefully.

418
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,009
I don't think either of us can find peace.

419
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,782
I'm awake,

420
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:09,301
As are you.

421
00:21:09,997 --> 00:21:12,508
I've been here since 11 p.m.

422
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:13,866
I'd prayed

423
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,782
That if my love is true,

424
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:19,310
You'd come up here within three hours.

425
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,168
Do you know

426
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:26,420
There were still five minutes left when you came up here.

427
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,074
Don't they have good trick cyclists in Karachi?

428
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,519
They have.

429
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,970
But mine is in Hyderabad.

430
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,058
Have your prayers been accepted?

431
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,103
Yes.

432
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,116
They've been.

433
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:39,800
So leave, would you?

434
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,550
The two of us have come up here for something important.

435
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,021
Forgive me,

436
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:48,061
But I'm not getting up from this swing.

437
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,951
Why not?

438
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:55,226
You've sat with me on this swing twice.

439
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,942
This swing is my place of worship, Mademoiselle Farah.

440
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,847
Then this swing is henceforth yours.

441
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,182
Put it in your car,

442
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:04,507
And take it along.

443
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,179
Hey!

444
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,323
That's brilliant.

445
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:10,383
What would I do with just this swing?

446
00:22:10,383 --> 00:22:12,966
I've tried sitting on it alone.

447
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:16,476
It's been asking me all this time, 'Where's your partner'?

448
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,347
Who?

449
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:21,647
Who's been asking you?

450
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:24,705
You won't understand it.

451
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:27,586
Ask one who was informed on the way

452
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:30,521
That it's the wrong way.

453
00:22:42,145 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm not leaving.

454
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:48,213
It is obligatory on me to take in this waft of air

455
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:51,216
Redolent of your fragrance.

456
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:55,463
Oh God!
-O God, hear my prayers!

457
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,255
What are you praying for?

458
00:22:58,255 --> 00:22:59,821
I won't tell you.

459
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:01,084
Don't.

460
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:05,005
But don't you dare mention me in your prayers!

461
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:07,367
He's calling.

462
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:10,774
So talk to him!

463
00:23:10,774 --> 00:23:12,393
Here. Let me talk.

464
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:14,118
Before Mehtab?

465
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:14,805
So what?

466
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:17,056
As if I'm afraid of anyone!

467
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,598
Hello?

468
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:22,183
Farah here.

469
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:24,277
Are you listening?

470
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,493
Just say a soft 'Hmm'.

471
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,325
I'll take it that you're listening.

472
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,832
Hmm.

473
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,307
Be done with your anger.

474
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,213
All that guff I'd uttered --

475
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,761
I'd like to apologise for it.

476
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:44,499
Just keep on loving me,

477
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:45,873
So much

478
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:47,779
That beholders and earwiggers

479
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,179
Die of envy!

480
00:23:59,103 --> 00:24:00,917
The plan about two-timing has been cancelled for now!

481
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,298
We'll talk about that

482
00:24:02,298 --> 00:24:04,763
Once this rascal Mehtab is gone.

483
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:07,261
I hope you're listening?

484
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,424
Here.

485
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,948
Talk to him.

486
00:24:11,948 --> 00:24:14,904
And ask him if he's heard everything I said.

487
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:15,626
And yes,

488
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,991
He didn't say 'It's okay'

489
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:19,283
In response to my apology.

490
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,034
Hello?

491
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:22,174
Lubna speaking.

492
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:23,847
I know.

493
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:27,184
Why didn't you say 'It's okay' in response to her apology?

494
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:28,786
It's okay.

495
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:29,769
He's said it.

496
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:30,640
Right,

497
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,989
Keep on 'loving' Farah

498
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:34,883
As long as she's in the soup!

499
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,519
I will.

500
00:24:36,713 --> 00:24:38,410
But how is she in the soup?

501
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,509
Mehtab and his Mum have come here again!

502
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:41,878
He met you.

503
00:24:41,878 --> 00:24:42,807
The same

504
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:45,660
You shook hands with at the gate?

505
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,020
So he's Mehtab?

506
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,788
Obviously.

507
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,359
Tell him

508
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,563
I'll give him a cheque of 200,000 tomorrow.

509
00:24:52,563 --> 00:24:53,327
Listen,

510
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:56,055
She'll give you your cheque tomorrow.

511
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:57,613
For what?

512
00:24:57,613 --> 00:25:00,337
She's giving you your salary in advance.

513
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:01,649
Oh...

514
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,750
I'm sure you're pleased.

515
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:07,115
I'm very pleased.

516
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:09,961
But may I ask something?

517
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:11,392
Sure, go on.

518
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,255
Does she

519
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:14,884
Love somebody else too?

520
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:16,432
I mean,

521
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,776
Does she love someone?

522
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,118
Sorry.

523
00:25:22,118 --> 00:25:23,634
Why are you saying sorry?

524
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,723
I figured I shouldn't have asked this.

525
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,073
No, you may ask.

526
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,897
But I don't have the answer to this.

527
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:31,086
As far as I'm aware,

528
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:34,089
That wee laddie hasn't been born yet!

529
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:37,491
So may I meet your father tomorrow?

530
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,708
He's asking if he can meet Dad tomorrow.

531
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,294
Yes,

532
00:25:40,294 --> 00:25:40,989
He'd better.

533
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:41,891
In fact,

534
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:43,587
He should finalise everything with Dad!

535
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:45,426
I heard that.

536
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:49,206
And ask her, what if he asked me to bring my parents?

537
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:49,998
So bring them,

538
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:52,397
What's the problem with that?

539
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,581
Okay.

540
00:25:53,581 --> 00:25:54,489
Good night.

541
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:56,036
Good night.

542
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:48,427
Don't you

543
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:51,925
Have any dreams these days?

544
00:26:54,632 --> 00:26:57,124
I've made arrangements so I don't.

545
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:59,825
And if, perchance, I have a silly one,

546
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:02,235
I'd pray to it, 'Go, sir',

547
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:05,432
'Show yourself somewhere else'.

548
00:27:06,428 --> 00:27:10,272
'There is no hope that you will be reified here'.

549
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,354
How you warp those words...

550
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:16,383
And how is that?

551
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,987
Put it plainly

552
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:21,401
That reality scares you.

553
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:22,837
God forbid!

554
00:27:23,281 --> 00:27:24,925
He has been very kind.

555
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,654
Everything is going on fine.

556
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:29,378
Why should I be scared?

557
00:27:29,936 --> 00:27:33,854
Your son has lost his job.

558
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:43,496
I thought I'd rather ask you about your dreams

559
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,755
Because

560
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:48,810
You conceal the truth so well.

561
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,632
Was that something to conceal or speak about?

562
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:52,435
What did he --

563
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:54,135
He was just a clerk.

564
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:56,887
As good as doing nothing.

565
00:27:58,147 --> 00:28:00,563
I used to think what would happen

566
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:03,056
To Hazrat Sahab's foretelling if he started off as a mere clerk.

567
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,574
Perhaps it'd take a hundred years to be fulfilled.

568
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:06,533
God willing,

569
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,357
He'd do something worthwhile now.

570
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,595
You'll see,

571
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:12,226
I'll have hopes again.

572
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:22,141
But then, where does he leave for at 8.30 in the morning?

573
00:28:22,673 --> 00:28:25,565
He won't sit at home, after all!

574
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:27,509
He tries his luck.

575
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:31,259
He'll find a post for himself on his own now.

576
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,367
But you don't trust him!

577
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:42,886
I trust him,

578
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:47,364
But it seems you don't trust me.

579
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:55,656
It is not necessary that I tell you every insignificant bit to prove that I trust you.

580
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:58,358
Only that it was significant,

581
00:28:58,358 --> 00:29:02,244
Except when you said it.

582
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,964
By the way, is he looking for a post or a popsy?

583
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:12,416
It'd do you good to remember carefully.

584
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,843
It's possible

585
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:18,440
That you accidentally uttered 'post' instead of 'popsy'.

586
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,200
So you know everything.

587
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,934
We are God's men, Madame.

588
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,343
We get the news

589
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:35,575
Even when we don't get it.

590
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,254
The only thing I've not been able to find out

591
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:42,083
Is who the popsy is.

592
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,650
Arifa knows.

593
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:51,452
She won't tell me.

594
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:54,795
How can she avoid telling when you ask?

595
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:58,233
She won't avoid

596
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:01,110
But it'd break her oath.

597
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,393
So, I thought

598
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:06,344
It's better that I remain in ignorance

599
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:10,375
Than commit the sin of breaking an oath.

600
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:46,722
You're vexed with me.

601
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:54,152
I have lost the right to be vexed.

602
00:30:54,622 --> 00:30:56,922
Honestly, Molvi Sahab,

603
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,336
Is placating someone like this morally justified?

604
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:03,748
Politics isn't morally justified in love either,

605
00:31:03,748 --> 00:31:08,759
Nor that you drag in the law at the time of need.

606
00:31:10,149 --> 00:31:14,648
I consider this title of 'Molvi' an honour,

607
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:18,483
And you use it as a barb.

608
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,711
It'd be better

609
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,695
If you don't conceal anything.

610
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:27,725
It's also better because

611
00:31:27,725 --> 00:31:31,437
Nothing ever remains concealed.

612
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,770
Do you want me to apologise?

613
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,683
There is no

614
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,497
Injunction against

615
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:43,429
A wife's apology,

616
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,560
But if you apologise as a mother,

617
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,970
You'd get me in the mire.

618
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,292
And if it displeases the Master,

619
00:31:55,292 --> 00:32:00,356
A lifelong of dominion shall be ravaged.

620
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,050
Then, here's a compliment:

621
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:08,293
Go on.

622
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:12,484
I consider this title of 'Molvi' an honour.

623
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:15,993
You may have me say it under oath.

624
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,958
How about some breakfast?

625
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:45,749
No,

626
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,300
I'll just have some tea.

627
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,455
Have some tea first, then.

628
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:56,865
Know what,

629
00:32:56,865 --> 00:32:58,741
I had a strange dream last night.

630
00:32:58,741 --> 00:32:59,983
I saw that you

631
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:02,721
Were on the train headed for Karachi.

632
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:05,831
You had to see the train headed for Karachi!

633
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:07,535
Trains leave everyday, mate.

634
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,391
Have I ever been to Karachi?

635
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:11,627
Anyway, tell me about your dream.

636
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,712
I saw a girl with you.

637
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:16,439
I recognised her as soon as I saw her.

638
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,648
Who was it?

639
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,257
Not the one who writes you letters!

640
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,215
What do you know who writes me letters?

641
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,680
I do know it isn't Sheikh Ibrahim's daughter.

642
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,448
What are you saying?

643
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,202
She was with you in the dream.

644
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:37,889
She was so relaxed and convivial

645
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:40,996
As if thoroughly acquainted with you!

646
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,373
W -- Which one?

647
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:43,447
The elder one.

648
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:44,436
I don't know her name.

649
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,956
Farah!

650
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:47,808
Hey!

651
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:50,558
That's not how you mention someone!

652
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,920
I'm getting late.

653
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,570
Have your tea.

654
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,585
M -- Mum!

655
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:25,981
Mum!
-Mum!

656
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:27,409
Mum!
-Mum!

657
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:29,393
What happened?
-Mehtab --

658
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:31,378
Mehtab?
-Come!

659
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,990
It kills me to see --

660
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:36,792
Mehtab!

661
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,848
My dear...

662
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:42,115
My child! Careful there --
-Quickly!

663
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:45,486
Easy there.
-He's losing a lot of blood...

664
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:48,329
Quick!

665
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,630
Let me go!

666
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
Mehtab!

667
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:53,754
He'll be alright, Aunt --
-He's bleeding!

668
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:56,294
Madame, please calm down.
-He'll be alright.

669
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:57,815
Easy, Aunt...
-My child...

670
00:35:57,815 --> 00:35:59,790
Madame --

671
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:02,903
Nothing will go wrong, Madame.

672
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:09,482
So much --

673
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:11,675
Aunt!

674
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:12,506
Aunt!

675
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,660
Aunt!
-Madame!

676
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,878
Why are you standing here like that? Go and get some water!

677
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,005
Madame!

678
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:19,819
Look here, Madame!

679
00:36:19,819 --> 00:36:22,363
God willing, nothing will happen to him!

680
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:25,845
Easy there, Madame. Hopefully, we'll get some good news.

681
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:28,333
Nothing will happen to him.

682
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,940
Madame...

683
00:36:34,121 --> 00:36:35,426
My son --

684
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,038
He was still breathing.

685
00:36:37,038 --> 00:36:38,707
I didn't let him lose a lot of blood.

686
00:36:38,707 --> 00:36:40,480
I tied my scarf

687
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,481
Around his wrist tightly.

688
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:44,402
Get up, Madame. Come.

689
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,444
What do I do?

690
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:47,654
Come.

691
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,440
Come here.

692
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,443
What happened to him?

693
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:57,463
He slit his wrist.

694
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,456
Attempted suicide?

695
00:37:00,456 --> 00:37:01,928
Yes.

696
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,225
This is one for the police.

697
00:37:04,225 --> 00:37:05,589
It's one for the doctor.

698
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:08,026
Blood was gushing like a fountain before this scarf was tied.

699
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:11,275
That's alright, but we'd have to inform the police.

700
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:15,386
Get him back among the living and then inform the police.

701
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,500
His heart is beating fine.

702
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,126
It would.

703
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:24,983
It's a rather chary attempt at suicide.

704
00:37:24,983 --> 00:37:26,298
Bring him to.

705
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:27,567
Nurse,

706
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:29,567
Get him on the drip.

707
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,834
How long will it take?

708
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,834
Just about 15 minutes.

709
00:37:35,537 --> 00:37:37,738
But who is this?

710
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:40,154
Our guest from Karachi.

711
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:42,776
It seems his family's quite well off.

712
00:37:42,776 --> 00:37:44,108
Very well off,

713
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,803
But he's very bad himself.

714
00:37:47,273 --> 00:37:49,772
Why has he attempted suicide?

715
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:52,061
The police will ask about this.

716
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,470
Why tell the police? It's an internal matter.

717
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,270
He's opening his eyes!

718
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,617
Our eyes have been opened too.

719
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:15,659
Where am I?

720
00:38:15,847 --> 00:38:18,042
You tell me - Where are you?

721
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,870
If you're still alive, let me tell you

722
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,044
You're still in Hyderabad.

723
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:23,231
And if you're dead,

724
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:26,371
You'd get to know after all your deeds have been accounted for.

725
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,759
Why am I still alive?

726
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:30,961
Because you didn't slit your wrist properly.

727
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,934
Alright, doctor,

728
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,278
Call the police.

729
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,613
Police?

730
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:35,508
Why?

731
00:38:35,508 --> 00:38:36,728
It's a legal affair.

732
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:39,233
There's only two ends you can get when you attempt suicide -

733
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,762
Straight to God if you're dead,

734
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,050
And straight to the cops if you survive.

735
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:47,597
Kill me, doctor!

736
00:38:47,597 --> 00:38:48,705
Don't worry.

737
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:50,204
Dad will be here soon.

738
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,192
God willing, he'd kill you!

739
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:57,424
Oh God, what will I say to Uncle?

740
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:58,994
Forget about Uncle,

741
00:38:58,994 --> 00:39:02,419
Think about what you'd say to the cops!

742
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:04,944
The punishment for surviving is worse than that for dying!

743
00:39:04,944 --> 00:39:06,462
Mum!

744
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:08,647
Mum fell unconscious in a moment,

745
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:09,945
Only God knows

746
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:12,305
If she's been revived or not!

747
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,434
G -- Get this off me, doctor! I --

748
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:15,802
I'm going to see Mum!

749
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:17,278
You'll go only after you've been unfettered!

750
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:19,458
For now, lie down!

751
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:21,195
There.

752
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,884
Dad's here.

753
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
