1
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:13,706
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:18,816
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:23,976
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:30,348
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:35,946
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:40,536
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,349
No.

8
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,970
I won't Dad at your work's.

9
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:37,370
I mean, I --

10
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,674
Won't work at your Dad's.

11
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,502
Who has asked you to?

12
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,920
Work for us till December.

13
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,730
For you?

14
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,521
You'll get such a salary you'd be left counting it all!

15
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,551
And a designation that will leave you awestruck!

16
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:55,182
H -- How much?

17
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,190
As much as you say!

18
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,160
I mean as much as you can think of!

19
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,687
And

20
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,187
Designation?

21
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:06,237
We can decide your designation if you agree.

22
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:09,766
Where's your office?

23
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,676
We don't have an office.

24
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,356
What?

25
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:16,886
Lubna,

26
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,796
I don't want a poltroon for this job.

27
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:19,657
No --

28
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,967
I'm not a poltroon.

29
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,226
Then say yes!

30
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:24,807
Why are you asking our office address?

31
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:27,026
It's all legal, isn't it?

32
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,001
No,

33
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,833
I mean I've promised Dad I'd not do anything dodgy.

34
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,842
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,294
I just said 'dodgy' spontaneously.

36
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,022
Then say it with firmness that you're ready!

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,620
What's with the firmness?

38
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,570
I mean,

39
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,560
Does it involve a threat to my life?

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Yes, it may.

41
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,332
So say it plainly that you won't do it.

42
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,902
How can that be?

43
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:56,149
I'll do it even if it means putting my life at risk.
-Good.

44
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,492
That's the spirit!

45
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,319
What's the job?

46
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,919
I'll tell you. Have something first.

47
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,530
How will I have something?

48
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,860
I'm not hungry.

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,131
You're lying.

50
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:12,101
You were opening your lunch box before my eyes!

51
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,683
No --

52
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,180
That was because Arifa had said...

53
00:04:15,263 --> 00:04:16,451
Actually,

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,351
Arifa orders me like a mother;

55
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:20,261
So I thought I'd eat.

56
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,429
I was really not hungry.

57
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:24,499
Lubna,

58
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:25,981
Let's talk business.

59
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:30,371
Alright, we'll pay you 200,000 a month.

60
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,859
200,000?

61
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,688
Farah will pay you from her personal account,

62
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,548
That is why you won't get more than that.

63
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,243
And we'll give you additional allowance

64
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:41,549
For your dresses and all.

65
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,788
You --

66
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:46,188
You're must be kidding!

67
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,738
You're kidding.

68
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:50,021
You're pretending as if you've never seen 200,000.

69
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,661
I haven't.

70
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,908
I've only seen the 98,000

71
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:56,578
That I won playing the matches.

72
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:59,409
Playing matches or gambling?

73
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:10,638
Can you stand firm and talk to our father ?

74
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,336
I can.

75
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,336
But I have great respect for him.

76
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:17,146
He called me today and said, 'Take your place at our office'.

77
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:19,146
Are you out of your mind?

78
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:22,446
You'd leave a job that gets you 200,000 and take one that earns you 10,000?

79
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,286
I won't.

80
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:25,316
But --

81
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,376
Must I stand firm before him?

82
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:32,473
Is he into this business too?

83
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:35,363
The entire business lies in his hands.

84
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,663
You just have to snatch it from him for four months.

85
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you looking for?

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
A handkerchief.

87
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,320
Thank you.

88
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,860
To snatch the business from a father's hands is sinful.

89
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,186
Listen to the whole thing.

90
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:11,996
Yes?

91
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,027
Pray tell, I'm listening...

92
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:19,486
The thing is, Farah is getting married to Mehtab Chawla on the 15th of December.

93
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,350
Look at me!

94
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,190
Right, so where was I?

95
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,080
Glass -- water.

96
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,350
Did you hear what I just said?

97
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,091
Yes.

98
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:54,141
The truth is that Farah does not want to marry him.

99
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:02,441
Now that the date's been fixed, the situation's gotten a tad bit hairy.

100
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,536
But Farah has found a way out of this.

101
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,693
She's mustered the courage to tell Dad

102
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,676
That she does not want to marry Mehtab

103
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:11,596
Because she loves someone else.

104
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,477
In all truthfulness, this isn't quite true either.

105
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,246
She doesn't love anyone.

106
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:27,028
She just wants the marriage put on ice.

107
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,013
And

108
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,463
That's where you come in to help.

109
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,771
Help?

110
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:37,300
Your help and the job are one and the same.

111
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:41,876
What do I have to do?

112
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:45,146
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

113
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,436
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

114
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,776
If necessary, you'd stand firm before Dad in saying,

115
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:53,766
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

116
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,366
You'll take it quietly if he wants to whack you over it.

117
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,517
If he aims his gun, you'll say resolutely,

118
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:01,756
'Shoot me'!

119
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,016
But I can assure you

120
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,366
It won't come to that.

121
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,116
And if it does come to that,

122
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:08,587
His aim's nawful!

123
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,906
My aunt made it out alive, too!

124
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,760
Excuse me...

125
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,470
Why did he black out like that?

126
00:08:58,657 --> 00:08:59,946
I've told you,

127
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,666
He's taken a shock.

128
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,236
What shock?

129
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:05,096
Besides a salary of 200,000,

130
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,498
I'm allowing him to love me for four months!

131
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:09,986
How could this ever shock

132
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,386
A clerk earning 10,000?

133
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,664
Try to understand, Farah.

134
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:14,563
His heart's woeful right now.

135
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,513
How is that?

136
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,493
Try to remember

137
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:18,363
Whose son he is.

138
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,115
Why do I need to try to remember?

139
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:22,053
If you do remember, I hope you'd understand

140
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:24,193
That he thinks like Molvi Sahab.

141
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,363
Meaning?

142
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:26,843
What does he think?

143
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:27,773
He's thinking

144
00:09:27,773 --> 00:09:31,915
About what a girl from an honourable family is doing to one-up her father!

145
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:33,475
Put a sock in it!

146
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:37,325
It's merely been days since he turned so faithful!

147
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,825
When one has newly turned faithful,

148
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,775
He sticks to his principles faithfully!

149
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:44,465
Anyway,

150
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:47,165
You don't need to get worried.

151
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,435
We can find someone else.

152
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:51,075
What?

153
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:53,455
You want to besmirch my name everywhere!

154
00:09:53,455 --> 00:09:55,695
That blighter will tell his sister,

155
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,365
And what will she think about me?

156
00:09:57,365 --> 00:09:59,955
She'll not think of anything but call me

157
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,645
And ask me about what Afzal is saying.

158
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:02,725
I'll say it plainly,

159
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:03,725
'He's lying'.

160
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,022
You'd better.

161
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,418
And say it in a way

162
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,966
That if Molvi Sahab heard it, he'd break his face!

163
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:11,853
May I go now?

164
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:12,932
Go where?

165
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:14,452
Sit.

166
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:18,496
And don't you dare budge from here until this smirch is washed off me!

167
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:19,992
Smirch?

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,870
Oh God...

169
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,192
Who is it?

170
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:32,510
Dad?

171
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,889
It's me.

172
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,666
It's you!

173
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:42,906
How come you're here so early?
-Let me get in.

174
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,606
Why are you shivering?

175
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,870
I can't figure out myself.

176
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,826
Where's Mum?

177
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,151
She's gone to Aunt Kausar's to lustrate her child.

178
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,371
She'll be back soon.

179
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:58,211
Get me a quilt.

180
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:00,412
A quilt?

181
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,792
This cold is killing me...

182
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,672
Go to your room.

183
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,363
Take me, will you?

184
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:31,380
You have a fever too...

185
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,359
It's just a fever...

186
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,530
It may be malaria.

187
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:37,949
No.

188
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,249
I don't have malaria.

189
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:41,420
I say

190
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,669
Go and see a doctor.

191
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,287
What do I tell him?

192
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,677
For God's sake,

193
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:48,929
Get yourself checked up.

194
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,757
Why are you feeling so cold in the summer?

195
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,887
Could it actually be malaria?

196
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,429
Just give me a quilt.

197
00:11:57,837 --> 00:12:00,637
I'll start sweating in a moment.

198
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,586
You would, sure.

199
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:06,327
Alright, I'll get you one.

200
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,419
What do I have to do?

201
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,679
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

202
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,979
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

203
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:40,469
If necessary, you'd stand firm before Dad in saying,

204
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:45,339
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

205
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,367
Here.

206
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,978
Quickly, now...

207
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,784
I think you're fine!

208
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,670
Show me your hand.

209
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,676
The temperature's worn off...

210
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:45,226
Shall I turn on the fan?
-Beware!

211
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,073
What's this way of talking?

212
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,273
Why 'beware'?

213
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:50,963
I just uttered --

214
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,653
I mean, don't turn on the fan.

215
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,473
I'll start shivering again.

216
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,433
You've got malaria, then.

217
00:13:56,433 --> 00:14:00,083
That's what makes you hot and cold.

218
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,493
To be honest,

219
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,886
I don't have malaria.

220
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,344
I swear.

221
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,959
Would you please tell me what has happened?

222
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,439
Stay quiet, Mum!

223
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,529
Walk so that your footfalls cannot be heard!

224
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,349
Alright...

225
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,669
Come.

226
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,369
What happened?
-Malaria.

227
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,719
What?

228
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,551
It doesn't seem so...

229
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,650
Not me, Dad, he's got it. Afzal!

230
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,240
He's in his room wrapped in a quilt.

231
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,674
With a quilt?
-Yes.

232
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,522
Came home early from office.
-Oh?

233
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:17,619
I swear, Dad, he was shivering so much!

234
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,570
Come and see!

235
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,606
Look at him.

236
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:31,606
He's all drenched with sweat.

237
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:34,510
Why didn't he see a doctor?

238
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,544
I'd asked him to,

239
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:38,463
But he didn't agree to.

240
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:41,842
What's there to agree or disagree over here?

241
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,945
Wake him up.

242
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,790
Everything seems to be alright here...

243
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,820
Wake up, my good man!

244
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,680
Dad?

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,310
It's you...

246
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,550
What happened?

247
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:11,339
Nothing.

248
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,942
Arifa here

249
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:19,452
Told me you were shivering when you came back from the office?

250
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:21,622
It was just about then...

251
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,053
I'm fine now.

252
00:16:23,053 --> 00:16:25,782
You won't see a doctor?

253
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:28,362
What would I do?

254
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,782
I neither have a fever nor am I shivering.

255
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,782
I hope everything is alright at your office?

256
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:35,982
No --

257
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:39,122
There's no problem there.

258
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:44,112
It's been two days since Monseigneur last came for his morning prayers.

259
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:49,483
He doesn't usually do so when he's in town.

260
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:53,812
You must be meeting him sometimes?

261
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,652
Some --

262
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,512
Sometimes, yes.

263
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:00,232
Alright, I say

264
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,502
You get some rest.

265
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,010
Prepare some yahni for him.

266
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,187
If he starts shivering again,

267
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,477
Drag him to the doctor's.

268
00:17:17,544 --> 00:17:19,374
Call him later.

269
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:21,104
Yes, Dad.

270
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:25,455
And when will your mother be back?

271
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,855
Before sunset.

272
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:29,837
Alright.

273
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,040
Close the door.

274
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:46,136
Get me some yahni, will you?

275
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,859
And yes,

276
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,049
Where's the key to the cupboard?

277
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,617
If I'm not mistaken,

278
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,979
Monseigneur's daughter

279
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,839
Is your friend, isn't she?

280
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,996
What's her name --?

281
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,376
Lubna.

282
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:09,196
What happened?

283
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,346
Nothing, really.

284
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,686
I'm sure she calls you once in a while?

285
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:17,998
Yes, sometimes.

286
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,916
She always asks about you.

287
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,278
Meh.

288
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:27,936
Sit down for a while, so that I, too, get a feeling that I'm preparing yahni for someone who's ill.

289
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:42,094
Such ornate sets, Madame, that would bedazzle Farah!

290
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:45,644
Not a single bangle is without diamonds.

291
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:47,410
Have you purchased everything?

292
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:49,126
Why not?

293
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:50,874
Purchased them and had them kept in the locker.

294
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,197
We're now thinking about the dresses.

295
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:55,881
I'm looking at gold embroidery samples.

296
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:57,944
It'll take at least 50 biscuits.

297
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,439
Biscuits?

298
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,422
You know, bars of pure gold.

299
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,431
We call them 'biscuits'.

300
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:07,024
Oh...

301
00:19:08,322 --> 00:19:12,822
And Mehtab here was saying that he'd gift her a Ferrari when he'd come to see her.

302
00:19:12,822 --> 00:19:14,122
Ferrari?

303
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:15,669
Yes, it's a bit dear, but

304
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:18,212
Not more than our Farah, certainly!

305
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,412
Tell me,

306
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:21,524
How go your preparations?

307
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:24,943
We're just deciding...

308
00:19:24,943 --> 00:19:26,452
Deciding?

309
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:31,244
Monseigneur will call you in the evening when he's back.

310
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,559
That's new.

311
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,329
New?

312
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,330
The men of your family talk about the wedding preparations?

313
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,493
He's

314
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,850
Been preparing for a few days.

315
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,111
He'll tell you everything today.

316
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,501
Okay.

317
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,251
I would request you, Madame...

318
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:50,581
Yes?

319
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:52,901
Ask Farah

320
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,495
To talk to Mehtab sometimes.

321
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,671
What's with all the shyness in her conduct?

322
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,392
Shyness is but natural in her conduct --

323
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,672
I mean,

324
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:04,341
This, too, will be decided tonight.

325
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:06,910
Right...

326
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,879
How could I say this to Monseigneur?

327
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:12,309
God willing, it will not have to come to that.

328
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,699
He'll tell everything.

329
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:16,750
Alright,

330
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,736
I'll talk to him about this too.

331
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:21,236
Give my love to Farah.

332
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,640
Bye.

333
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:25,252
Ohh...

334
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,699
You agreed to everything she said.

335
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,200
Don't be too hasty.

336
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,809
It's just a matter of a few hours.

337
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,179
It'll all get started

338
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,539
As soon as Monseigneur calls.

339
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:23,418
Hey!

340
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:25,101
You're out here, studying peacefully,

341
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:27,072
While your future is being decided over there!

342
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:28,873
Tonight, at last, you'll have to tell

343
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:29,888
Who he is.

344
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,028
What can I do?

345
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,758
Think about it and tell me his name!

346
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,368
Whom do I name?

347
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:38,028
You'd suggested that blighter,

348
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:40,588
But he blacked out as soon as he heard it!

349
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:41,918
Purify yourself.

350
00:21:41,918 --> 00:21:43,118
Purify?

351
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,778
It isn't time for praying yet.

352
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,618
It's time for an additional prayer.

353
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,449
Resolve to offer 100 of them,

354
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:50,228
And sit on the prayer mat right now.

355
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:52,071
What are you saying?

356
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:54,258
By God, girl!

357
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,728
When you can't find a way out yourself,

358
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,338
You ask for God's help!

359
00:21:57,338 --> 00:21:58,558
Quickly; Mum's coming.

360
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:00,790
And Dad's coming in an hour too.

361
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,080
Which prayer is she offering right now?

362
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,113
It's time for neither the sunset one, nor the dusk one.

363
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:55,276
Care to tell

364
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:57,738
Which prayer is she offering right now?

365
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,816
Additional prayers.

366
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:01,316
She'd made a vow

367
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:04,196
To offer a hundred additional prayers if her special job is done.

368
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,006
A hundred?

369
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,346
And what was this vow about?

370
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,206
The same, Mum, about Mehtab.

371
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:13,466
She's even taken to praying regularly that she's not married off to him.

372
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:16,236
Here, she's offering additional prayers to fulfil her vow,

373
00:23:16,236 --> 00:23:19,646
And there, Shugufta has had jewellery worth hundreds of thousands made.

374
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:22,456
And she was telling me that every kind of ornament

375
00:23:22,456 --> 00:23:25,238
Has diamonds studded in it.

376
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,226
So how is this cause for worry?

377
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:29,176
They'll be of use to some other girl.

378
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:30,626
They'll be of use

379
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,276
When your father declines them.

380
00:23:33,276 --> 00:23:34,496
So why don't you say it?

381
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,646
'Please decline'!

382
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:37,926
Call that boy first.

383
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:40,177
She's not even telling me his name.

384
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,056
She'll tell you after her prayers.

385
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:43,656
Stop her halfway.

386
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,936
Tell her that her job's not done yet.

387
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,237
She'll be complaining to God for nothing later on.

388
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:50,026
And tell her yourself

389
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:54,236
To be downstairs with all the lad's details before your father arrives.

390
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:55,987
Otherwise, it's none of my responsibility.

391
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,717
By the Lord, she didn't feel any shame when falling in love with him,

392
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:02,687
But now she's feeling shame in mentioning his name!

393
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,676
How many are you done with?

394
00:24:32,676 --> 00:24:34,956
Just 12.
-Enough.

395
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,986
Ask for blessings, and continue with the remaining 88 after the news bulletin.

396
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,277
Why?

397
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:40,523
Ask for blessings,

398
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:41,613
Bolt the door,

399
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,653
Sit and think who he is!

400
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:46,183
You'll be facing Dad in an hour!

401
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,583
Dad will call to decline

402
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:49,653
Only if you can argue your case before him.

403
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:50,641
Or else

404
00:24:50,641 --> 00:24:51,976
Neither your destiny,

405
00:24:51,976 --> 00:24:53,514
Nor the date of your marriage will change.

406
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:54,883
Where are you going?

407
00:24:54,883 --> 00:24:56,493
Excuse me, please!

408
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:59,353
Your narking has fried my brains!

409
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:02,753
You could say I'd die the moment Dad would thunder.

410
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,183
No more help, sweetheart.

411
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:05,571
It's over!

412
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:47,116
Oui, Monsieur Mehtab?

413
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:48,556
Not Mehtab...

414
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,136
Afzal.

415
00:25:50,436 --> 00:25:51,624
Hey!

416
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,386
You called?

417
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,436
I thought you'd never come to once you were out.

418
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:57,837
No.

419
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,343
I'm fully conscious.

420
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:01,406
So, why did you call me?

421
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,076
To say yes.

422
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,920
Yes, as in?

423
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:10,863
The job and designation you were talking about

424
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,380
So, I was saying

425
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,468
I accept.

426
00:26:17,738 --> 00:26:19,598
Really?

427
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:23,058
Would I have called to lie?

428
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:24,698
You've thought about it, haven't you?

429
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,368
This job means putting your life on the line.

430
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:29,218
Dad can do anything when he's furious.

431
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:30,359
Please

432
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,660
Talk about Farah.

433
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,508
Farah?

434
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:35,690
Don't you remember

435
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,061
What she'd said at the restaurant.

436
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:39,440
What?

437
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:42,241
'It may involve a threat to your life'.

438
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,016
Yes?

439
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:47,351
Do you think your father will kill me?

440
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,401
Quite possible.

441
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,150
Alright, then.

442
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,879
It ends there.

443
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,989
I will sacrifice myself.

444
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,679
But please tell me...

445
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,104
Yes?

446
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,580
This love will go on for four months?

447
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,740
You'll have to keep it going on.

448
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,539
Will we meet, too?

449
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,360
Obviously, you'll get to meet us.

450
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:14,564
But what will happen after four months?

451
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:17,881
Do you know how much you'd earn in four months?

452
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,225
800,000.

453
00:27:19,225 --> 00:27:20,519
That'd be enough.

454
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:24,799
Start a business with the 800,000, and keep on blessing Farah.

455
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,180
The love ends there?

456
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,880
Love?

457
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,570
I mean -- the job...

458
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,181
The job ends the day Farah likes a boy

459
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:38,072
And Dad says, 'He's the one'!

460
00:27:38,072 --> 00:27:40,134
What about me?

461
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:41,561
What could happen?

462
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:44,281
Dad will never agree on you.

463
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:47,916
By God, he'll create such a scene at the mention of your name --

464
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,960
Dad will create a scene, and the two of you will act your parts.

465
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,600
Farah will weep before Dad, naming you,

466
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,150
And you will fall at his feet, saying,

467
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,340
'Uncle, I can't live without Farah'.

468
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,870
'I'd die without her; I'd take poison'!

469
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,200
Then?

470
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,140
What, then?

471
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,900
Farah will threaten him similarly.

472
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,990
He'd be scared at hers, for sure.

473
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,831
Won't he agree if he got scared?

474
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,539
He may if his daughter threatened...

475
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:13,947
But don't worry,

476
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:16,133
We've thought of a way out of this too.

477
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,160
What's the way out of that?

478
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,740
You'd two-time Farah.

479
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,923
Two-time?

480
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:25,420
That's what the onlookers will think

481
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,920
First, love her with all your heart,

482
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,610
And then run away a two-timer!

483
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,611
What do you mean, 'Run away'?

484
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:31,641
You --

485
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:33,740
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

486
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,880
What do the perfidious do?

487
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,690
What do they do?

488
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,700
Leave for Karachi for a few days, my good man...

489
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,500
Change your phone number,

490
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,740
Farah will weep before Dad and say,

491
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,580
'Afzal's left me, Dad'!

492
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,963
'He's smitten with another girl'!

493
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:51,944
I swear by God, I'm not smitten with any other girl!

494
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:53,914
Did anyone ask you?

495
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:55,841
And that girl who writes you letters,

496
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:58,151
Is she your Mum?

497
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:00,060
Anyway,

498
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,199
Just think

499
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,770
Your relationship ends

500
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,759
The moment you two-time her.

501
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,709
That's it.

502
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,753
That's what she wants you to do and that's what she's paying you 800,000 for.

503
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:10,149
Is it too little for you?

504
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,229
It's too much.

505
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:16,930
The perfidious deserves not a penny.

506
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,129
Alright, I'll disconnect.

507
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:22,279
Tell her the deal's done.

508
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,352
I'll do exactly what she says.

509
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,410
Farah!

510
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,849
Farah!

511
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:19,731
If you're afraid that I may get angry on hearing his name,

512
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:22,388
You're wrong in thinking so.

513
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:28,028
I listened to it that you love someone,

514
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:29,448
And said

515
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:33,588
That I'd reject Mehtab after meeting him,

516
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:35,388
Why are you getting worried?

517
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:36,668
Don't you think

518
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,998
I'm a liberal father?

519
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:41,408
I consider it natural to love,

520
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,220
As long as it does not smirch the girl's honour.

521
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:46,626
I --

522
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:48,427
I swear, Dad...

523
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:51,085
You don't need to swear.

524
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:53,615
I trust you.

525
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:56,735
Just tell me his name.

526
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,409
Give me his number.

527
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:02,254
I want to talk to him.

528
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:09,269
And I promise you that once I've talked to him, I'd call to decline Mehtab.

529
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:12,316
What's the problem with you now?

530
00:31:12,316 --> 00:31:15,086
Say something; answer him!

531
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,900
Ease her a bit.

532
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,957
Even if he's a tad lower in status or rank,

533
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:24,797
Accept him.

534
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:26,677
That's a thing for later, Irsa.

535
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,648
First, let her say something!

536
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,238
Just a minute!

537
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,398
I'm sorry, Dad.

538
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,890
But if you give me a minute, she'll say everything.

539
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:43,669
Alright. Come and sit here.

540
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:47,859
No, Dad, I won't sit here.

541
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,729
I'll take her along for a minute.

542
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:56,499
Okay.

543
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,979
Take her.

544
00:32:07,236 --> 00:32:08,949
He's neither turned tail,

545
00:32:08,949 --> 00:32:11,060
Nor declined.

546
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,399
He's agreed.

547
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,533
He's even agreed

548
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,229
To sacrifice himself

549
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,200
If Dad wants to take his life.

550
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,124
But today, you will only mention his name.

551
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:25,010
You will not say he's Molvi Subhanallah's son.

552
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,409
Did he say that?

553
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:27,673
I'm saying this.

554
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,029
Start off with the sparklers

555
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:31,010
Before igniting the bigger bombs.

556
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,189
But Mum will suspect immediately.

557
00:32:33,189 --> 00:32:36,369
She'll ask, 'Are you talking about Molvi Subhanallah's son'?

558
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:38,470
What should I do, then?

559
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:42,026
You've been performing well enough so far,

560
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,356
So keep it up!

561
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:46,398
Mention his name, and come out of the room demurely.

562
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,306
Mum would swoon.

563
00:32:48,306 --> 00:32:49,836
Dad would swoon, too.

564
00:32:49,836 --> 00:32:52,026
But you'd better remain in your senses.

565
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,476
Get up the moment you name him,

566
00:32:53,476 --> 00:32:55,526
And before they come to,

567
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:58,026
Come out of the room.

568
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,150
What's the matter now?

569
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,982
Will he come if you call him?

570
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,272
Why should I call him?

571
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,912
You call him now.

572
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,342
He'll open up when you talk to him.

573
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,512
Open up, as in?

574
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:20,992
He'll have to open up so he can speak openly before Dad!

575
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:22,122
Haven't you seen

576
00:33:22,122 --> 00:33:25,273
He starts stammering when talking to you!

577
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:28,422
Monseigneur says that it's been a minute.

578
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,810
Go

579
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,270
And tell him quickly

580
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,310
That his name's Afzal.

581
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,740
May we talk right now?

582
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,079
Yes.

583
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:21,270
What's his name?

584
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I'll only tell you his name today.

585
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,246
Alright.

586
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:28,191
Just his name today.

587
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,240
Afzal.

588
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:37,281
Afzal isn't his name --

589
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:40,261
That was a remark about his character.

590
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,731
That is his name.

591
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:45,593
It wasn't a remark about his character.

592
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,369
May I go?

593
00:35:00,369 --> 00:35:02,639
Who's this Afzal?

594
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,560
Molvi Subhanallah's son?

595
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,130
Is he the same?

596
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,190
Tell me!

597
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,930
Answer me!

598
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,964
Tell me it's the same if he is!

599
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,040
Yes.

600
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,430
He's the same Afzal...

601
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:57,843
How is it that you are swooning over a lad from the neighbourhood,

602
00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:01,699
And my angelic sixth sense hasn't the foggiest?

603
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,401
This means

604
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:11,470
That I have failed in my duties as a mother.

605
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,734
I told you, Mum...

606
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:15,590
It was just childhood feelings.

607
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,454
I realised when we grew up

608
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:19,730
That I love him.

609
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:23,139
I don't meet him.

610
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,768
Don't leave this stone unturned!

611
00:36:26,698 --> 00:36:28,976
The thing is

612
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:31,076
Given the time of a year or a half,

613
00:36:31,076 --> 00:36:34,230
I can correct my mistake.

614
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,636
How will you correct your childhood love?

615
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,340
Touché.

616
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,764
Didn't it ever occur to you,

617
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:44,290
The mention of his name could kill!

618
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,860
I made a mistake...

619
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,440
A mistake is one that's committed once,

620
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,689
And never repeated again.

621
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:55,421
Now, you tell me what I should do...

622
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,881
That's why I was quiet all along --

623
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,010
Hesitant to mention his name.

624
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,500
His name says it all.

625
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,189
Call him tomorrow.

626
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,997
And ask him to meet me first.

627
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:08,957
What'll you do when you meet him?

628
00:37:08,957 --> 00:37:10,567
Let Dad meet...

629
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:14,308
You want that he should say something before your Dad

630
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,445
That overwhelms his heart.

631
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:19,377
Traditionally, it's the mother who meets the boy first.

632
00:37:19,575 --> 00:37:21,216
Alright. Call him

633
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:23,215
And ask him when he'll come.

634
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:24,866
Also, tell me

635
00:37:24,866 --> 00:37:27,009
What he likes to eat.

636
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,567
Leave that be, Mum.

637
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,566
Just -- serve him some tea.

638
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:33,603
As you wish.

639
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:34,866
A --

640
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,839
Ask Dad

641
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,806
To call Mehtab.

642
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,817
Don't worry; he will.

643
00:37:40,817 --> 00:37:45,836
Now that you're determined, everything will end up in your favour.

644
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:47,857
May I go now?

645
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:50,696
My phone's upstairs in my room...

646
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:52,273
Go.

647
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,320
Done earwigging?

648
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,540
Shut up!

649
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,349
