1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,164
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:10,396
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:10,396 --> 00:00:16,726
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:22,277
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:27,070
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:56,723
Who was it?

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,402
Afzal's family.

9
00:00:58,402 --> 00:00:59,195
I mean,

10
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,444
It seemed they were his family by the way they asked.

11
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,861
They must've come asking about him.

12
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:06,133
No, Mam.

13
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,631
They don't know anything.

14
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,179
They just came looking.

15
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,801
They're asking where he is.

16
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,801
Didn't you tell them?

17
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:15,716
That's what I've come to ask - should I tell them?

18
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:17,323
How many people have come?

19
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:18,247
Two.

20
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:19,903
Father and daughter.

21
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:23,686
They didn't even mention who they are to Afzal!

22
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:25,331
Alright,

23
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:27,513
Get them inside, I'll get some tea.

24
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:28,794
I'll get them inside,

25
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:30,096
And prepare some tea.

26
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,564
You'd much rather sit with them.

27
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:42,196
Sit.

28
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:43,891
Come in --
-No.

29
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,104
I'm fine.

30
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,667
I don't need to sit.

31
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,574
I'll get you some tea.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,865
I'd like a cup of strong tea.

33
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,341
I like strong tea too!

34
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:54,451
I'll get some.

35
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,980
You've come from Hyderabad, haven't you?

36
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,223
Yes.

37
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:35,333
I didn't really need to ask that.

38
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:39,879
If you're a relative of Afzal's, you would obviously be from Hyderabad.

39
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,926
How long has he been here?

40
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:43,990
Not here.

41
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,712
Upstairs.

42
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,786
But he's staying here, isn't he?

43
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,598
It's been three months.

44
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:54,233
Doesn't he come downstairs?

45
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,113
No.

46
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,708
He just came to give us some sweets once.

47
00:02:56,708 --> 00:03:00,027
When he enlisted as a security guard.

48
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,834
What do you do?

49
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:05,860
Nothing.

50
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,384
Earned my BA a year ago,

51
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,456
And I've been at home ever since.

52
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,876
Why?

53
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,429
Because of Wali.

54
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:15,894
Wali is my Aunt's son.

55
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:17,821
He's got his eyes on me.

56
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:20,072
Eyes, as in?

57
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:22,456
Don't you know what that means?

58
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,299
What do you do?

59
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:25,572
I'm pursuing an MBA.

60
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,005
It's my last semester.

61
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:30,551
Right. So he's 'got his eyes on me' as in

62
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,177
He looks at me the wrong way.

63
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:34,787
Oh...

64
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,216
As in,

65
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,687
You don't like him.

66
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,002
Ask forgiveness of God!

67
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:40,574
He's been married twice!

68
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:42,170
The cad's an ace ruffian.

69
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,111
He's a strongman around here.

70
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,766
All his strength ebbed away that day, though!

71
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:50,106
Afzal gave the sleeveen a proper pasting one day!

72
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,553
Pasting?

73
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:54,308
As in beat him black and blue!

74
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,578
Why?

75
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:57,613
Because of me.

76
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:00,309
Wali wanted to force me into marrying him.

77
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,968
It enraged Afzal,

78
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:06,077
And he gave him --
-A proper pasting?

79
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,009
Yes.

80
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,930
If he comes back in a while, that's alright,

81
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,772
Or we're headed to Clifton.

82
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,773
We live there.

83
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,054
I'll

84
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:27,241
Meet him tomorrow morning.

85
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:28,757
Monseigneur,

86
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:32,295
When I'd said that Afzal's gone somewhere,

87
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,955
That was a lie.

88
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,168
I was afraid about who you may be,

89
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:39,489
And who you are to Afzal.

90
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:43,877
You may be shocked if you came to know the truth.

91
00:04:43,877 --> 00:04:45,800
Shocked?

92
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,659
The truth is

93
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,206
Afzal is in the hospital.

94
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,467
My nephew had shot him last night.

95
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,477
No --

96
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:56,722
It's nothing to worry.

97
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,751
He's fine.

98
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,812
The bullet just struck his leg.

99
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:03,296
The doctor's done with the operation too,

100
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,254
And he's said today

101
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:09,256
'You can take him home in a few days'.

102
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:17,105
Hey --

103
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:18,503
Wait.

104
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,068
Dad won't have tea.

105
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:22,403
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

106
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:25,639
You kept me so busy talking I forgot.

107
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,897
Put the tray down.

108
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,378
May we sit somewhere and talk?

109
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,135
Sure,

110
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,492
C'mon.

111
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,247
Start again from there.

112
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:50,499
Where?

113
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,004
Well, beaut, you just said,

114
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:55,436
'Afzal gave your cousin a proper pasting'.

115
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,920
I like it very much.

116
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,142
What?

117
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:02,684
You've begun to address me as 'beaut'.

118
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:05,653
Anyway, tell me,

119
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,969
Who are you to him?

120
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,130
Who are you to him?

121
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,779
I'm just his landlady.

122
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,624
Not gonna lie to you, actually, I'm his landlady's daughter.

123
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:16,958
A lie.

124
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:21,111
One doesn't risk his life for his landlady's daughter.

125
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:23,470
Touché.

126
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,219
Then,

127
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,221
What's the story?

128
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,902
You think the same too?

129
00:06:29,902 --> 00:06:31,350
What?

130
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,276
What it is is I can't conceal my feelings.

131
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,154
What are your feelings?

132
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,395
This is the first time we're meeting,

133
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:44,801
And you're getting at such deep secrets in the first meeting?

134
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,138
Sorry...

135
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,996
There's no need to tell if you found it awkward...

136
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:51,147
There's nothing to tell, really.

137
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:51,842
Just --

138
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:56,403
Our squabbles ended when he clobbered Wali.

139
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,743
You had squabbles before?

140
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,834
Oh, those!

141
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:02,132
I used to think he's a hooligan!

142
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:05,382
He said one day, 'I'll chuck you out'!

143
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,599
Then?

144
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,772
What then?

145
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:11,351
I only found out later he's very good at heart.

146
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:13,583
Very good.

147
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,865
Good...

148
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,899
It must've taken --

149
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:22,419
At least a month to get to the heart?

150
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:24,073
A month, or maybe...

151
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,960
Two days?

152
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,268
H -- Haven't you asked him

153
00:07:32,268 --> 00:07:34,701
If there's another girl in his life?

154
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,774
Nobody.

155
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:37,413
There's no girl in his life.

156
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:41,312
I asked him the very day Mam had the impression that he's good-looking

157
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:45,137
So he must've had at least one girl head over heels after him!

158
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:45,880
So

159
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,200
He said there's no one?

160
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,236
Wouldn't she have come after him?

161
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,982
For his part, he'd said, too,

162
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,594
'There's no one'.

163
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:57,405
You tell me,

164
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:59,852
Who are you to him?

165
00:08:00,362 --> 00:08:01,799
I --

166
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:04,426
I'm nobody to him.

167
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,436
Your --

168
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,676
Father's calling you.

169
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,319
Okay.

170
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,152
She didn't even have her tea.

171
00:08:15,152 --> 00:08:17,589
You haven't told her, have you,

172
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,155
That Afzal's been shot?

173
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:19,938
I haven't.

174
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:21,023
Good.

175
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:24,201
Her father, too, asked me not to tell her.

176
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,020
What could have happened if I'd told?

177
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,763
Who's she to him?

178
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,476
Didn't you ask her?

179
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,633
I did.

180
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,603
She said she's nobody to him.

181
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:33,949
She must be angry with him

182
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,653
That's why she said this.

183
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,212
Angry, as in?

184
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,726
Is she someone to him?

185
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:42,554
She's come after him because she is someone to him!

186
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,352
You silly girl!

187
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,582
She's the daughter of an affluent mill owner.

188
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:47,934
Think about it,

189
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:52,677
Why would she come looking for a pleb like Afzal?

190
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:36,665
God is the Greatest.

191
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,346
Greetings, sir.

192
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,164
Greetings. How are you, Mehboob Ali?

193
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,183
I'm good.

194
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,864
You've come here after long.

195
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:46,583
Yes, we'd

196
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,430
Stay here a few days.

197
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,409
Greetings, Mademoiselle.

198
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,363
Get the luggage out from the boot.
-Greetings.

199
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:53,285
I think you didn't recognise me...

200
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:56,206
I did alright.

201
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:02,260
Are we not going back?

202
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,550
Why would we?

203
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:08,131
We'd take him along now that we've come here.

204
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,242
He's not going back.

205
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,565
Who told you?

206
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,673
Just what I thought.

207
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,324
He's settled here.

208
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,993
He's gotten a job as a security guard.

209
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,252
Like the dickens is he settled!

210
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,741
Leave it be.

211
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:23,253
You won't get it.

212
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:25,836
So why don't you explain it?

213
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:30,571
It isn't exactly picnic, whiling away my time here in Karachi!

214
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:33,068
Along with a job as a security guard,

215
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,475
He's also gotten the landlord's daughter.

216
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:37,729
That's the scene that's going on these days.

217
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,709
Come on, Farah.

218
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,832
Don't use your brain too much.

219
00:10:42,832 --> 00:10:43,880
Dad!

220
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,219
Don't you believe me?

221
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,550
Then stay in Karachi.

222
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,635
In a few days,

223
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,678
You might even hit the enlightenment.

224
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,453
He's a connatural blighter,

225
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,453
Leching after a girl where he sees o--

226
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:57,867
Sorry --

227
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:58,882
I --

228
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,596
Just uttered it spontaneously.

229
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:01,955
Sorry...

230
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,455
Are you talking about Yasmin?

231
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,895
Yes, Dad.

232
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,979
Alright.

233
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,646
Freshen up,

234
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,527
We'll talk after dinner.

235
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,552
I won't have dinner.

236
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,147
I don't feel hungry at all.

237
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,867
Listen!

238
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,921
You're accosting my experience more so than his disposition.

239
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:30,838
Someone my age, even if blind,

240
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:34,761
Can judge a man's character by his mere words.

241
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,350
Then you don't know, Dad,

242
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,098
What he's up to!

243
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:39,927
He casts such a spell

244
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:43,770
That blinds every onlooker.

245
00:12:00,814 --> 00:12:01,873
Hello?

246
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,168
What's the matter with you?

247
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,910
Why are you laughing like that?

248
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,736
What

249
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:11,097
Was it that you used to sing?

250
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,718
'I've tasted blood'?

251
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:13,873
Innit?

252
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:14,956
Listen, then -

253
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,684
Well, this blighter's certainly tasted blood!

254
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:20,231
He's been caught here, too.

255
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,535
Caught?

256
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:24,349
Well,

257
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,864
What's it to you?

258
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:27,038
Whether he gets caught,

259
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,805
Or writes letter to another Farah,

260
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:30,326
Or has a pash

261
00:12:30,326 --> 00:12:33,137
On his landlady's daughter?

262
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,781
He's still 'Afzal' [excellent] in your eyes!

263
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,006
Hey!

264
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,212
He's not like that.

265
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,465
Why don't you come to Karachi?

266
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:43,871
I'll introduce you to his new girlfriend!

267
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,738
Are you telling the truth?

268
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,515
I've just met her.

269
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:49,371
The poor lass,

270
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:52,088
She'd die for him.

271
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,544
I don't believe this...

272
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,933
It's broken your heart, hasn't it?

273
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,166
It's my fault.

274
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,805
I told you so quickly.

275
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,354
Honestly, though, she is quite sweet.

276
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,140
You're lying, aren't you?

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,417
I'd die where I stand if I lie!

278
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:11,184
I've talked to her for an hour.

279
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,871
She's very innocent,

280
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,676
Trapped in that arrant knave's ploy!

281
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:18,127
Which arrant knave?

282
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:19,223
Your Afzal.

283
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,500
Who else could it be?

284
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,475
I swear,

285
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:22,782
If you'd hear her out,

286
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:23,745
You'd say,

287
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:24,625
'Alright'.

288
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,965
'Afzal's all yours'.

289
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,004
I would never!

290
00:13:29,004 --> 00:13:31,794
Afzal will only be hers whose he should rightfully be!

291
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,071
Alright.

292
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:35,366
I'll meet her again tomorrow.

293
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:36,642
Why?

294
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:37,783
I'll ask her

295
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,734
If she can sing

296
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,425
'I've tasted blood'!

297
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:41,955
She must be able to!

298
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,351
So?

299
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:44,147
So what?

300
00:13:44,147 --> 00:13:45,838
The two of you will duel it out.

301
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:46,747
And the winner

302
00:13:46,747 --> 00:13:48,581
Gets Afzal!

303
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:51,385
I don't think you're in your senses.

304
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:52,228
There!

305
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,799
Your envy has burnt you to ashes,

306
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,304
And you're saying I'm not in my senses!

307
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,615
Aren't you coming to Karachi?

308
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:00,677
Get a move on!

309
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,648
Why should I come?

310
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,616
Hey!

311
00:14:03,616 --> 00:14:06,054
Will you come here after that rapscallion

312
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,146
Has robbed you of your love?

313
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:11,205
Take a sleeping pill and go to bed.

314
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,319
Why should I take a pill?

315
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,583
You take one.

316
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,023
There are four pills

317
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,101
In the drawer of my writing table.

318
00:14:19,101 --> 00:14:20,938
You may take all four if you want.

319
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:22,807
Where's Dad?

320
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,070
He's traumatised.

321
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,835
Go

322
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:26,365
And sit with Dad.

323
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,802
You may end up doing something!

324
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,833
I was thinking of the same.

325
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,103
Let him come before my eyes!

326
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:35,540
I'll tear his face for you!

327
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,965
I'll jab these long nails

328
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,165
Into his eyes!

329
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,322
Why

330
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:21,992
Have you brought us to this room from the ward?

331
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,583
We don't have the money to pay the bill.

332
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,825
We've just been ordered

333
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,950
To shift the patient to the room.

334
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,359
As far as the money is concerned,

335
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,481
One gets a room in this hospital only after making a payment.

336
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,047
What?

337
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,434
You can ask the doctor about everything else.

338
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,967
He'll be here shortly.

339
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:50,288
I know who would have paid the bills.

340
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,992
Who?

341
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,170
Yasmin.

342
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,574
The man who'd come along,

343
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,995
He's a mill owner?

344
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,463
Yes.

345
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:24,567
Not being funny, she's the mill owner's daughter for real!

346
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,910
But why did she say she's nobody to him?

347
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:36,508
If someone asked you who you are to Afzal,

348
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:38,914
What would you say?

349
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:44,599
You can call Afzal and ask him the true story.

350
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:48,557
It'll save you the fatal trouble of thinking.

351
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,074
I would, Mam,

352
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:54,640
But I'm afraid.

353
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,485
When she said she's nobody to him,

354
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:03,378
Her eyes made it clear that she's lying.

355
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:08,330
Her lie has frightened me, Mam,

356
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:14,142
And my heart says that Afzal will frighten me with his truth if I called him.

357
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,206
We'll go to meet him tomorrow.

358
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:20,171
I say you ask him about the true story casually.

359
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,866
There's no need to ask now.

360
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:25,521
He'll be taken to Hyderabad tomorrow morning.

361
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,148
Hey!

362
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,837
How would they take him?

363
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:30,184
I mean,

364
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:32,886
How can he go in this condition?

365
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,088
And won't he meet us before leaving?

366
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,170
Won't he settle his dues?

367
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,929
He'll have to pay every penny that he owes us before he leaves!

368
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:47,990
I'll seize all his goods in the morning.

369
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:03,283
I've given Kaneez Fatima the allowance;

370
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,966
She'll take care of your provisions.

371
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,955
Listen carefully, now,

372
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:14,046
Leave no stone unturned in cleaning this house; I'll check every corner when I'm back.

373
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,850
And what are you looking at?

374
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,480
Come on,

375
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Put your bag in the car and come along.

376
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:26,635
Where are we going?

377
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,120
Why are you asking this again and again?

378
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,060
We'd stay there for four days?

379
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,793
Perhaps four, perhaps five.

380
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,104
Perhaps we may be back tomorrow.

381
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:37,040
Quickly, now, come.

382
00:18:51,954 --> 00:18:54,501
I'm sorry Dad...

383
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,570
I figure you've

384
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,263
Not slept properly last night.

385
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,224
No --

386
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,243
I've had a good night's sleep.

387
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,220
I can see that.

388
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:06,920
No,

389
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,387
I was just thinking what we're doing here.

390
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:12,587
We should've gone back last night.

391
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,837
I'd promised Molvi Sahab

392
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:19,223
That I'd only come back with Afzal by my side.

393
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,526
It seems you've reneged on your promise.

394
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:24,406
Afzal won't be leaving this place.

395
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,602
He will.

396
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:29,956
I know he can't turn me down.

397
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,270
Lubna and your Mum

398
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,646
Will be here in a while too.

399
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:35,361
Splendid!

400
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:38,361
Such sedulous preparations to bring him back!

401
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,024
Just the four of us,

402
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:41,732
Or is someone else invited too?

403
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,669
I've invited them because

404
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,391
We're not going anywhere for four days.

405
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:47,265
Sorry Dad,

406
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,771
But I'm not staying here four days.

407
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,377
Why don't you have Lubna stay?

408
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:53,612
Mum and I will go back today.

409
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:56,489
You don't know why we're staying here,

410
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:00,564
And you wouldn't want to budge from here if you found out.

411
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,895
Pray tell.

412
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:06,063
Promise me, first,

413
00:20:06,063 --> 00:20:10,499
That you'll not call Arifa and her family to tell them.

414
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:11,863
Has he gotten married?

415
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,562
Are you in your senses?

416
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,710
Who'd he get married to?

417
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,351
Yasmin, of course!

418
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:20,100
Her expressions were just like a wife's!

419
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,854
Talking to her, it felt

420
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,379
As if she's missing him.

421
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:29,072
He's in a hospital right now.

422
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,503
A lad by the name of Wali had shot him.

423
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,499
He's taken two bullets.

424
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:47,375
And if word got to Molvi Sahab,

425
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,371
Or

426
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,717
If his Mum found out,

427
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:54,219
I fear one of them will die on hearing the news.

428
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,855
So, I've called Irsa here

429
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,109
To ask her

430
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:01,342
What I should do in this situation.

431
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:02,843
He's alive, isn't he?

432
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,999
Yes, he is.

433
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,047
He's had an operation.

434
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:10,051
Hopefully, he'll be able to walk in a few days.

435
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,966
This Wali is the same one, Dad.

436
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:13,846
Yasmin's cousin.

437
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:16,015
Yes, that's the name she'd mentioned!

438
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:18,119
Yes, it's the same, alright.

439
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,516
Afzal had beaten him black and blue over a row earlier.

440
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,707
Not just any row.

441
00:21:24,707 --> 00:21:27,364
A row over Yasmin.

442
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:29,677
He'd fought for her,

443
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:33,705
And it's for her he's taken the bullets!

444
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:36,515
Lassie's the real deal!

445
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:40,514
The blighter put his life on the line for her!

446
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:43,070
That's brilliant.

447
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,304
Lubna will be thunderstruck

448
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,650
To hear this.

449
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,582
You're absolutely right, Dad.

450
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:52,691
I'm not budging from here.

451
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,106
In fact, I'll go and meet him.

452
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,284
I'll even click a photograph of him.

453
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:59,234
The thing is,

454
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,587
One only finds such lovers

455
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:03,585
In books these days.

456
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,199
Don't call to inform Hyderabad.

457
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,600
No way, Dad.

458
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,848
Am I not the full shilling?

459
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:24,279
Babu Hamid!

460
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,454
Babu Hamid!
-Yes?

461
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:28,636
What happened?

462
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:29,231
What is it?

463
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,074
You're alright, aren't you?

464
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:32,451
I am, mate.

465
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,712
Do you want me to take a stroll to prove it?

466
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:36,687
Leave it be, boyo.

467
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:39,031
This...

468
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,781
How much does this room cost?

469
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:43,648
Must be around

470
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:45,307
8 to 10 thousand?

471
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,427
We're dead, then, mate.

472
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:49,924
Yasmin will incarcerate me

473
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:52,565
And say, 'You'll only leave after paying me all the money'.

474
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,487
Where'd you leave for?

475
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,607
I'd go to Wali once I'm out.

476
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,484
Are you crazy?

477
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:01,979
Let bygones be bygones.

478
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,381
Forget Wali.

479
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,330
I'd miss him more if it pained a bit more.

480
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,730
How can I forget him?

481
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,618
Remember, Babu Hamid,

482
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,817
It's a real bad habit to pick up a gun and fire it.

483
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:16,382
It should be nipped in the bud.

484
00:23:16,382 --> 00:23:18,822
That blighter will kill somebody else tomorrow.

485
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:20,244
Who knows,

486
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:24,622
The poor man at the other end of his barrel might just die this time!

487
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:27,181
But don't worry, mate.

488
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:30,900
I'll only exact as much revenge as he deserves for his tyranny.

489
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:35,217
Find out after lunch tomorrow where he'll be for the next few days.

490
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:37,523
He'd be in hiding, Afzal.

491
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:39,372
Where will you find him?

492
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,263
He won't hide.

493
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:42,703
Not when a complaint hasn't been filed.

494
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:45,091
He'd think Afzal's afraid of him.

495
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,386
And Dad says,

496
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:51,329
'The terrorised is worse than the one who terrorises'.

497
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,105
Once, in fact, he'd even said,

498
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:56,977
'The oppressor doesn't make the oppressed',

499
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,245
'It's the oppressed who makes the oppressor'.

500
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:03,908
Find him within four days.

501
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:09,598
I don't want that blighter to become an oppressor because of me.

502
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,928
C'mon, Mam, the rickshaw's waiting down there!

503
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:44,424
H -- Here. Take this lunch box.

504
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:45,293
And listen,

505
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:48,168
Don't start your inquest about that girl the moment you get there!

506
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:49,120
Not at all.

507
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,870
I'll ask him in private.

508
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,987
First, I'll see if she's there or if she's left after asking how he's doing!

509
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:55,187
Alright, get downstairs,

510
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:57,829
I'll be coming after locking the door.

511
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:16,728
Wali!

512
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,130
So you remember my name!

513
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,190
Who is it, Yasmin?

514
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,223
It's me, Modryb.

515
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,238
Wali.

516
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,626
You filthy dog!

517
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,790
Get lost!

518
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:45,467
Your anger's not waned one bit, Modryb...

519
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:47,462
The same old style...

520
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,613
Hurled an abuse,

521
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,815
Slapped me...

522
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,344
Think about it, Modryb.

523
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:57,350
I'm not the old Wali.

524
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:58,353
Oh, please!

525
00:25:58,353 --> 00:25:59,340
Step aside!

526
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,687
I'm one step closer to my aim, and here you are asking me to step aside!

527
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,030
By the way,

528
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,919
Where are you off to?

529
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,520
You're going to the hospital.

530
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:20,943
What's in the box?

531
00:26:24,644 --> 00:26:27,120
Nothing's changed here.

532
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,349
The Modryb's the same way,

533
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,077
And the Modryb's daughter is the same old...

534
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:34,700
But I've changed, Yasmin.

535
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,842
I don't threaten anymore.

536
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,390
And if I ever do,

537
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,000
I don't give the luxury of counting to ten.

538
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,800
Move inside, now, will you?

539
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,440
There's nothing to fear.

540
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,340
I'll just sit inside for a while,

541
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,300
Have some of your tea,

542
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,088
Talk about some things and leave.

543
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:00,382
I swear by you!

544
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:04,415
Alright, if you want to go to the hospital after that, you may.

545
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,599
I won't stop you.

546
00:27:06,664 --> 00:27:08,344
I promise.

547
00:27:09,157 --> 00:27:10,710
C'mon!

548
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,600
Come, Yasmin.

549
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,770
Give the rickshaw driver a hundred and send him away.

550
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,751
See those two roughies over there?

551
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:45,779
Yes?

552
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:48,224
They're both Wali's men.

553
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:50,008
What are they doing here?

554
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:52,506
Ask what Wali is doing here!

555
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,801
Where's Wali?

556
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,760
Upstairs.

557
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,808
Hey!

558
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:14,738
Where?

559
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,140
Your oul' fella's in grave danger.

560
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:21,189
I'm going to make it clear to him,

561
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,662
'Now's the chance to run'.

562
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:26,406
'Otherwise, he's coming'.

563
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,800
Yasmin,

564
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,210
Give it to me.

565
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,040
Over here.

566
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:50,119
No, Modryb.

567
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,695
Don't do this.

568
00:28:51,695 --> 00:28:54,370
I'll have her tea only when she serves me.

569
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,102
Only then will I talk.

570
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:57,517
Look, Wali,

571
00:28:57,517 --> 00:29:00,032
Only show as much audacity as I can tolerate.

572
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,216
There, now!

573
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:04,210
You've changed, too, Modryb.

574
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:07,887
You've begun to tolerate her preparing and serving me tea.

575
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:10,421
Just one more step.

576
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:15,999
I'll have her tea only if she serves me.

577
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:17,702
You'll see, then,

578
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,837
I'll become an honourable man right here.

579
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:22,430
You're just like your father, young man!

580
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,425
In his family, they'd poison a virtuous child

581
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:25,924
When one is born!

582
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,538
I just asked for one more step, Modryb.

583
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:29,783
You took more than that.

584
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,202
Don't get to me Tad.

585
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,902
He'd be sitting up there in Paradise.

586
00:29:32,902 --> 00:29:36,725
God only knows what kind of 'Paradise' your Tad is in!
-Enough, Modryb!

587
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:38,952
That's too much.

588
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:40,946
Give me the cup, Mam.

589
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,508
I'll serve him tea.

590
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:49,162
That's like a sweet girl.

591
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,580
Not just sweet.

592
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,586
But very sweet.

593
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,699
This warm tea,

594
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,347
The warmth of your hands...

595
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:07,638
Did you see that?

596
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,964
You've coloured me

597
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:13,446
With the hues of your tea!

598
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:15,045
Sit, now,

599
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,282
Let us negotiate now.

600
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,735
Go on.

601
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:19,703
Yasmin!

602
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,712
Stay quiet, Mam.

603
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:23,338
Let me talk today.

604
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:24,631
C'mon, now!

605
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:26,278
Begin the negotiations!

606
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:28,288
I just have a one-point agenda, cousin.

607
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:29,571
Tell me,

608
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:31,474
Won't you marry me?

609
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:33,005
No.

610
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,066
I agree.

611
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,364
How say you agree to one point of mine?

612
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,381
Will you live with me without marrying me?

613
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,490
Wali!

614
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,800
It appears this option didn't exactly appeal to Modryb...

615
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,228
How about you?

616
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,800
I will rip you apart, you blighter!

617
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,240
Enough, Modryb!

618
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:03,090
It'd be better if the two of you decided who'd be negotiating.

619
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,516
And if we're negotiating, you'd better tell Modryb,

620
00:31:06,725 --> 00:31:09,336
We'll only let our mouths do the talking.

621
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,768
If that's not acceptable,

622
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,969
Let's talk about the second option.

623
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:15,821
Honestly,

624
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:18,598
Don't you fear Afzal?

625
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,147
I am very afraid of him.

626
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:25,703
But who knows when - if at all - the poor bloke will be able to stand on his feet.

627
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,475
Wait a few days,

628
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:29,657
The day he sets foot on the earth

629
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:31,379
Is the day you will no longer be found on it.

630
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:34,121
The next time he sets foot in this neighbourhood,

631
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:37,455
I'll send him straight to the grave.

632
00:31:37,703 --> 00:31:40,036
C'mon, Wali!

633
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,335
To your grave.

634
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:48,554
Everyone else, after you.

635
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,000
Afzal?

636
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:40,488
Afzal!

637
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:50,583
It's you!

638
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,153
Lie down!

639
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:54,307
You don't need to get up.

640
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,558
You --

641
00:32:57,302 --> 00:32:59,215
When did you come here?

642
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,055
How did you find out?

643
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:04,029
You think you've ventured into the great unknown?

644
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:04,880
Karachi is just

645
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,760
About 170 kilometres away!

646
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,507
Dad can find you in a moment if he wanted to!

647
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:13,733
That's what I feared.

648
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,270
If word got to Hyderabad,

649
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,696
It'll be trouble.

650
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:18,820
Oh?

651
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,164
So you think my arrival brings you trouble?

652
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:22,362
Not at all!

653
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:25,165
I'm just worried that Mum and Dad may have found out...

654
00:33:25,165 --> 00:33:27,428
They can't bear such news.

655
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:28,946
Hold your horses, Monsieur Afzal!

656
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,627
They haven't the foggiest

657
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:33,284
That you've taken two bullets and are in a hospital.

658
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:34,911
Thank you.

659
00:33:35,089 --> 00:33:36,422
Thank you for what?

660
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,509
I -- I'm saying it because

661
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:40,339
You've not told Mum and Dad.

662
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,982
Well,

663
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:45,268
How are you now?

664
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:47,561
I'm alright now.

665
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:49,655
I'll be able to walk in a few days.

666
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:52,243
What will you do when you get up?

667
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,337
What should I do?

668
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:57,134
Get out of here and get straight to Hyderabad.

669
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:00,938
What happened?

670
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,348
I've grown weary of Hyderabad now...

671
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:05,986
I won't go there now.

672
00:34:05,986 --> 00:34:08,615
Do you even know what condition your Mum and Dad are in?

673
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:11,257
They weep in your remembrance!

674
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,130
And you!

675
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,318
Why have you switched off your cell phone?

676
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:15,914
You're angry with me, right?

677
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:18,479
Why are you punishing Mum and Dad for it?

678
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,337
I'm punishing myself...

679
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:24,592
I'll go to Hyderabad once I've become something.

680
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:26,803
What will you become?

681
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:28,487
No idea.

682
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,999
You're not going to become anything.

683
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,934
In three months, you've just gotten a job as a security guard!

684
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:33,767
Have some shame!

685
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,550
At the very least, you wore a shirt and tie

686
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,893
Back when you worked at our office.

687
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,106
You --

688
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:41,404
Please sit, will you?

689
00:34:41,404 --> 00:34:42,754
Oh, shoot!

690
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:45,815
I'll stand here, talk, and leave.

691
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:47,831
Speaking of shooting,

692
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:50,306
Where have you been hit?

693
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:51,384
It's nothing --

694
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,245
Just two bullets over here,

695
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,389
But don't worry. They've operated them out.

696
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:57,786
But,

697
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:00,945
May I tell you something?

698
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,111
A wound more excruciating than that of the bullets

699
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:11,128
Was inflicted by the barbs I heard back in Hyderabad.

700
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,325
That may never heal.

701
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:14,784
That's why I've decided

702
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:17,593
To never return to Hyderabad.

703
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:19,293
You're very much alive.

704
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,858
But you're an ace runaway.

705
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:22,835
Alright.

706
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:24,160
I'm going; bye!

707
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,051
Listen!

708
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:27,788
Pray tell.

709
00:35:27,788 --> 00:35:30,117
I mean, go on.

710
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:32,428
Won't you ask me

711
00:35:32,428 --> 00:35:35,178
Why I'd brought Mum and Dad along for the engagement?

712
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:37,483
You're in a hospital after taking two bullets!

713
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:38,995
Worry about your wounds.

714
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:42,010
It's better if you just forgot about your engagement and marriage.

715
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,105
Good day.

716
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,026
Hey!

717
00:37:45,026 --> 00:37:46,974
It's you, Yasmin!

718
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,115
He's shot Babu Hamid!

719
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:11,645
That --

720
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:12,734
That was her!

721
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:16,686
The one who'd bumped into you in the other corridor.

722
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,327
I know her.

723
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:21,212
Who is she?

724
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:23,199
You'll find out.

725
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,670
You'll get to know, too,

726
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,304
When she bumps into you.

727
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:37,774
You can't just go like that!

728
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:41,062
The stitches will tear off and you wounds will start bleeding.
-I'm leaving because I want to!

729
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:41,776
Let me go!

730
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:42,602
Sit down!

731
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:43,697
You can't just --
-What is going on?

732
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,750
What's going on?

733
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:47,991
Where would you go in this condition?

734
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:50,544
My friend -- Babu Hamid...

735
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:52,074
He's been shot!

736
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:54,076
I don't know where he's been hit, but I'm going to him!

737
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:55,043
Alright,

738
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:56,126
Please.

739
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:58,000
You're not going anywhere. Sit here.

740
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,310
Just a second.

741
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,380
Sit down!

742
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:07,762
D -- Dad!

743
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,025
Over there!

744
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,229
Hey!

745
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,010
He's bleeding!

746
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,575
Wait, I'll call the doctor.

747
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,799
Your wound's bleeding!

748
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,496
Please, sit down!

749
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
