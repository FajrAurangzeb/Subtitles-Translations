1
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:13,525
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:18,735
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:23,895
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:30,315
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:35,635
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,705
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:18,110
Allow me, then.

8
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,879
I'll marry Afzal.

9
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,984
You're still awake, aren't you?

10
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes.

11
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:56,453
Are you alert or should we talk later?

12
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:57,907
Why later?

13
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,507
Talk now.

14
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:06,432
Do you remember that we had a meeting right here by this door?

15
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,110
Yes, we met.

16
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,290
I remember it well.

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,539
This was no ordinary meeting...

18
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:21,391
We had none of those 'Hi's, 'Hello's, 'Bye's or 'Good night's...

19
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:28,135
I think I'd come to you to convince you that I don't love Afzal.

20
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,620
Why, do you?

21
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,205
Shut up!

22
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,395
Let me complete.
-Stay back while you talk --

23
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:37,206
You slapped me last night.

24
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,198
Ah, that!

25
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:42,033
So I wasn't dreaming after all!

26
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:46,913
So you'd actually asked me to allow you to marry Afzal?

27
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,196
That's what you said, right?

28
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:51,254
I did, but --

29
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,783
But what?

30
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,643
How long has this been going on for?

31
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:56,004
What's been going on?

32
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:00,073
Don't hide anything now that it's out in the open.

33
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:01,415
Tell me.

34
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,177
You love him, don't you?

35
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:06,864
You're the one who writes letters to him under the name of Farah, right?

36
00:03:06,864 --> 00:03:08,604
You're going ahead of yourself, Farah.

37
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:11,104
I'm looking ahead, Lubna!

38
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,441
Oh God...

39
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,778
What a guileful girl you are!

40
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,572
All of it was happening right under my nose, under my name, and I knew nothing of it!

41
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:21,051
It's nothing like that.

42
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:24,291
Now that you're abandoning him,

43
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,642
I thought

44
00:03:25,642 --> 00:03:28,116
I should marry him.

45
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,881
I never thought he was appalling.

46
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:35,664
Think how appalling you are to me right now!

47
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,788
I'm beginning to despise you!

48
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,813
In fact, despise is a small word --

49
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,773
Loathing is more like it.

50
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,024
Have you had your breakfast?

51
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,443
You want to talk to me about breakfast?

52
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:50,820
You'd better have some.

53
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,460
Or you might just eat me up.

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,340
What will I eat you up?

55
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,849
You'll eat yourself up like this.

56
00:03:58,849 --> 00:03:59,934
Farah,

57
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,437
If it hurts you, you can decline.

58
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:05,800
But don't say all these harsh words to me.

59
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,193
Don't tell Mum and Dad.

60
00:04:10,193 --> 00:04:11,510
Why shouldn't I?

61
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,265
That's unjust, Farah.

62
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:17,484
Remember, Farah, how I used to conceal everything when you asked me to?

63
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:21,646
So you've fallen so low?

64
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:24,036
What are you talking about, Farah?

65
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:26,936
If a girl thinks about marrying Afzal,

66
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:28,946
Will it be a sin to do so?

67
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:30,516
Belay the idea of 'a girl'.

68
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:33,470
Let's talk about me.

69
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,856
Is my marriage to him not acceptable?

70
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:39,587
Is he a leper or a pariah or something?

71
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,447
I always found him so handsome...

72
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:43,769
Yes,

73
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:45,352
He's a Molvi's son,

74
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:47,462
So he's a tad poor...

75
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:50,312
But he's got a heart too.

76
00:04:50,522 --> 00:04:52,822
You write him letters, don't you?

77
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,713
Why would I write him letters?

78
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:57,025
Do I have a phone to grind spices?

79
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:59,212
Although, to be honest,

80
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,520
Writing an SMS does not have the romantic appeal of a letter.

81
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,416
If you say another word,

82
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,279
I'll spit in your face!

83
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,288
Relax, Farah.

84
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:12,125
Sit down and think calmly.

85
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,196
When he is of no concern to you,

86
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,265
To the Devil with him!

87
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:17,855
He may love whoever he likes,

88
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,747
He may marry whoever he likes!

89
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:23,060
He loves you too?

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,975
Hey!

91
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:27,816
If you ask me with such fury, I'm not disclosing any secret.

92
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:28,826
D -- don't

93
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,676
Don't slap me!

94
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:34,216
You're incapable of being slapped!

95
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:36,643
You're a top-class vile

96
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:38,653
Gadabout!

97
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,563
Gadabout?

98
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,462
When you offered me a job the other day,

99
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,662
I regretted my decision as I went back.

100
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:52,992
I told my wife,

101
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:55,380
'I've angered my would-be boss'.

102
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,271
She'd laugh if I told her today

103
00:05:57,271 --> 00:06:00,906
That the boss had come to his servant asking for a job.

104
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,752
Look, Shahnawaz, mate.

105
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,834
Afzal has apologised for everything

106
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,582
That happened that day.

107
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,255
Sorry as in 'very sorry'.

108
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:10,082
How say we get back to work now?

109
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:12,242
Back to work as in having him work for us,

110
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,250
Right?

111
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,235
Yes.

112
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,502
Look, Babu Hamid,

113
00:06:15,502 --> 00:06:17,168
Don't make me risk this.

114
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,863
Your friend vents his anger on anyone.

115
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:22,302
I assure you he won't.

116
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:25,521
Ask him if he assures us.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,503
Yes, I do.

118
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:30,747
Think carefully -

119
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:35,297
The toffs sometimes vent their wives' share of the anger on security guards.

120
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,607
Many even hurl abuses.

121
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,147
I won't listen to abuses.

122
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:42,407
Will you beat him in that case?

123
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,867
Would you look at that, Babu Hamid?

124
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,117
I'm looking.

125
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:50,797
But tell me - who'd listen to abuses?

126
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:53,360
Well, yes, there's a point there.

127
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,898
But I can't trust your friend, Babu Hamid.

128
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,307
Come, Afzal.

129
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:12,008
Thank you.

130
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,339
Wait.

131
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,488
You're hired.

132
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,150
I can trust you now.

133
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:38,964
Have you seen how they fear your anger?

134
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,968
Yes.

135
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,698
Some folks from the neighbourhood,

136
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,598
Wali,

137
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,082
And this friend of yours.

138
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,139
But I...

139
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,232
Fear that a man should fear another.

140
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:59,951
But I fear when I think what you'd get working as a security guard.

141
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,579
10,000 a month?

142
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,939
You're not worth 10,000 a month, Afzal.

143
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:05,889
Your estimates run like my Mum's.

144
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:07,769
That's what she thought.

145
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:11,269
But nobody gives me more than 10,000.

146
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,439
My first job earned me 10,000 too.

147
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,576
Yes, it did have quite some cachet...

148
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:20,753
I'd wear a shirt and trousers to job, with a tie...

149
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,666
I'll wear a uniform here.

150
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,730
A blue one!

151
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,020
To be honest with you,

152
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,079
You're expecting too much from me.

153
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,499
I'm not a man worth more than 10,000.

154
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,342
It's now been proven.

155
00:08:36,342 --> 00:08:39,769
I'd get 10,000 if I work at Ibrahim Cottons,

156
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,629
And 10,000 if I work as a security guard.

157
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,189
What will you do for your family with 10,000 a month?

158
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:49,910
Everything I'm doing is for my family.

159
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,659
When I can take care of my own expenses, I've saved my family 10,000.

160
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,524
Does your Dad earn enough?

161
00:08:55,524 --> 00:08:57,710
He doesn't earn.

162
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,950
He collects it directly from Him.

163
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,883
From whom?

164
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,787
He's a priest at a Mosque.

165
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:08,704
He gets 40,000 to 50,000 as his divine reward.

166
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:23,589
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you.

167
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,460
O Lord!

168
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:47,702
Grant the childless a virtuous and righteous child;

169
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,239
O Lord!

170
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,428
Grant some peace to the hearts of parents;

171
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,010
O Lord!

172
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:02,260
Grant children such elegant civility that they can forgive their parents' fallibilities.

173
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,066
What's he doing in Karachi now?
-I don't have the foggiest.

174
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,357
Ask him to come back and join at my office again.

175
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,846
He's not in contact with me.

176
00:10:35,846 --> 00:10:38,066
He must be calling you sometime?

177
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,640
His phone's switched off since the day he left.

178
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,640
But

179
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,850
He...

180
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,570
Will contact me. He can't live without me.

181
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,660
Where in Karachi is he?

182
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,801
I only mention Karachi because

183
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:59,695
He used to say he'd go to Karachi before he left.

184
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:03,688
He didn't seem to be that type.

185
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,159
He isn't that type.

186
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,358
I don't know what got into him

187
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:12,539
That he severed all ties with us too...

188
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:15,302
I have full confidence in him

189
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,656
But his Mum worries...

190
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:21,296
Starts talking to God directly!

191
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,206
As if to say,

192
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:28,050
God Himself gave him a ticket and took him to Karachi.

193
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,129
If you say,

194
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:34,408
I can get someone in Karachi on him.

195
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:37,236
If he is in Karachi, it'll only take some 4 or 6 days to find out.

196
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:40,877
That will be a huge favour on me, Monseigneur Ibrahim.

197
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:45,547
Once I find out where he is

198
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,186
I'll arrive at his doorstep

199
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,486
And bring him straight to your office.

200
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,019
Alright.

201
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,841
Now, give me permission.

202
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,616
Please don't forget it.

203
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,967
Don't worry, I won't.

204
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,586
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

205
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,392
Thank the Lord, he's fine.

206
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:21,439
But where is he?

207
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,110
A prophecy cannot tell where he is.

208
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,699
Then how can it tell he's fine?

209
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,499
Mum! What are you saying?

210
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,090
If you can name the neighbourhood, I can find out the rest!

211
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,951
You're giving in to emotion.

212
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:41,560
That's all a prophecy could tell.

213
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,580
So tell me about someone who can look at his numbers and get to his neighbourhood.

214
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,373
Who could look at his numbers like that?

215
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:52,250
For there is no such technique.

216
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,030
Don't forget

217
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,976
That you're Molvi Subhanallah's wife.

218
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:04,951
Don't get swept away in emotions to believe in some unenlightened prophecy.

219
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,480
To be honest,

220
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,495
If there were a technique to find a lost son,

221
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:14,459
I swear by God,

222
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,959
It wouldn't be known to anyone but the mother.

223
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,390
It'd be better

224
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,449
That you ask Molvi Sahab

225
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,816
To go and find him.

226
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,170
My child,

227
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,770
I think I should be going now.

228
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,010
Hey!

229
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,476
Mr Karim Ahmed! Peace be upon you.

230
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,596
And upon you, peace.

231
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,097
You're --

232
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:53,016
Leaving?

233
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,366
Yes.

234
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,352
I'd come to prophesize about your Afzal.

235
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:03,116
Now, I can prophesize too, but

236
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:07,405
Ruqaiyya doesn't quite believe me.

237
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,666
When it's about her son,

238
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:13,616
A mother fears even his father.

239
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,397
There's always a suspicion

240
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:18,290
That you may end up comforting her

241
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,966
In the name of prophesising.

242
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,260
I take your leave.
-In the name of God; come.

243
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,990
Thank you very much.

244
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,830
Take that as well.

245
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,501
Alright, I'll have something sweet [= I bring good news]

246
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:41,617
We'll get to know in a few days

247
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:44,006
Where he is now.

248
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:46,228
Why should I believe that?

249
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:49,989
If we'll get to know, what's with these 'few days'?

250
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,489
Because

251
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,788
Monseigneur Ibrahim has agreed to it.

252
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,700
He said

253
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,518
He'd be able to find him in a few days.

254
00:15:00,521 --> 00:15:01,721
Just pray

255
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:03,301
That he

256
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,831
Had left for Karachi.

257
00:15:06,212 --> 00:15:07,661
What do you mean?

258
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,162
Has he not gone to Karachi?

259
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:13,902
Good Lord, it doesn't mean that.

260
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:18,133
It's very likely he's gone to Karachi.

261
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,713
But your son

262
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:25,153
Makes unlikely many such things that are highly likely.

263
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,762
He's gone there.

264
00:15:26,762 --> 00:15:28,652
When he said he'd go to Karachi,

265
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:31,332
Take it as if he dropped a hint.

266
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,736
Don't worry.

267
00:15:33,736 --> 00:15:37,943
Our efforts to find him will begin in Karachi tomorrow.

268
00:15:37,943 --> 00:15:41,353
Monseigneur Ibrahim has many contacts.

269
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:42,999
He's promised me

270
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,492
And I'm sure he would find him.

271
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:49,252
It's also possible we may find out tomorrow or the day after?

272
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:52,162
It is indeed.

273
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,342
Arifa!

274
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,872
Arifa!

275
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,372
Get some dessert for your father.

276
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,719
Yes, his name's Afzal Subhanallah.

277
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,689
No.

278
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:08,639
I'm not saying 'Subhanallah' [praise the Lord] because of something he's done.

279
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,199
Yes, 'Subhanallah'.

280
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:18,300
That's it, Monsieur, I'm mentioning his father's name!

281
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,251
You'd actually find yourself praising the Lord if you meet him!

282
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,276
He must be around

283
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:29,356
25, 26 years old?

284
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,837
Picture...

285
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,337
I can send you tomorrow morning.

286
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,750
No, he won't be in a posh neighbourhood.

287
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,553
He doesn't have so much money.

288
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:46,751
Alright.

289
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:48,800
You'll get his photograph tomorrow.

290
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:50,241
Okay.

291
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,050
I felt pity for Molvi Sahab today.

292
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:12,110
He didn't mention anything except righteous and duteous children in his prayers.

293
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,880
I'm thinking I'll call on him one of these days

294
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,343
To give them hope.

295
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,843
Why not call on him tomorrow?

296
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,679
Give him some consolation over tea,

297
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:23,270
And

298
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,410
Bring a photograph of Afzal when you come back.

299
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,480
We're going to need one to find him.

300
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
Alright.

301
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,190
I'll go tomorrow.

302
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,900
But...

303
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,360
But what?

304
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:40,081
Wouldn't it seem rather strange -

305
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:43,780
Farah's mother asking for Afzal's photograph?

306
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,391
Why would it be strange?

307
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:48,781
Say it plainly, 'We're trying to find your son'.

308
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:51,825
'We'd need his photograph for it'.

309
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,412
Now he's no minister

310
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:55,492
That I'd say his name, and those looking for him would say,

311
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,272
'Oh'!

312
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:58,219
'You're talking about him'!

313
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,829
But Farah will ask why we're looking for him.

314
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,550
You'd only know if you met her psychiatrist!

315
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,899
What would I know?

316
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,362
He asked me the moment he saw me, 'Do you know someone by the name of Afzal'?

317
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:11,490
I said, 'Yes, I do'.

318
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,360
Smugly, he said, 'He's fled from Hyderabad'.

319
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,319
'You'd better find him and bring him back, or else --'
-'Or else'?

320
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,099
'The affliction will become immedicable'.

321
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,829
What's her affliction?

322
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:24,579
By the Lord, Irsa Begum,

323
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:28,409
Don't ask me the name of this affliction.

324
00:18:34,094 --> 00:18:38,252
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

325
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,486
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

326
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,094
<i>Slumbering in my veins, it has now awakened...</i>

327
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,813
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

328
00:18:57,907 --> 00:19:01,939
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

329
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:07,235
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

330
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:14,407
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

331
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,747
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

332
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:20,814
Hey!

333
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:22,644
How long have you been here?

334
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,474
What is going on?

335
00:19:24,474 --> 00:19:26,894
What's going on? I'm just singing a song.

336
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:30,034
Oh wait, I got it wrong, let me try again...

337
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:33,224
I've tasted b--
-Stop it, Lubna!

338
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:35,424
Get me through to him.

339
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,564
To whom?

340
00:19:36,564 --> 00:19:39,834
That blighter Afzal. Who else could it be?

341
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:42,636
His phone's switched off.

342
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:46,027
Give me the number that's active.

343
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,217
He doesn't have any other number.

344
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:53,447
It's impossible that you're singing [romantic] songs from Ram Leela when you have been out of touch with him!

345
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,939
We're not in touch right now.

346
00:19:56,334 --> 00:20:00,237
I do try his number every night before I go to bed.

347
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:03,207
The wretch keeps it switched off!

348
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,595
So it's gotten so far!

349
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:08,704
There are no limits in love.

350
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:10,724
Things can go to any lengths.

351
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:14,874
Don't forget you're Sheikh Ibrahim's daughter!

352
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:16,954
I never forget it.

353
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:19,314
Let go of my hand.

354
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,110
I'll only marry him if things go forward.

355
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,770
I'll not elope with him.

356
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,091
Alright.

357
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:34,150
I'll go and tell Mum.

358
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,406
Get ready

359
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:38,041
We'll call him from Karachi and get him married to you!

360
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,034
Really?

361
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:41,545
What does it look like?

362
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:44,035
I swear, Mum won't say no if you talk to her!

363
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,031
She'll even convince Dad!

364
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:48,461
You'd talk today, won't you?

365
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:50,709
Not today.

366
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,339
But right now!

367
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:53,899
There!

368
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,813
My heart was right in saying that.

369
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,919
What was your heart saying?

370
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,035
That

371
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,006
It is only on Farah's face that you can see such fury.

372
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:05,090
She's like a candle on the inside -

373
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,845
She'll melt as the slightest of warmth touches her.

374
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,340
Right,

375
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,990
What is it, Farah?

376
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,130
Where's Dad?

377
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,620
He retired to his room after the news bulletin.

378
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,740
Please, sit.

379
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm sitting now.

380
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,350
Go on.

381
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,530
Say something; Get on with it.

382
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,540
Get Lubna married off.

383
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,050
Splendid.

384
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,885
So this is what you'd wanted to say.

385
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,330
Is it you who's got this itch,

386
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,440
Or her?

387
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:03,227
Tell me!

388
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,076
Where does this thing about her marriage come from?

389
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,864
It hasn't come from anywhere...

390
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,246
I was just thinking --

391
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,727
She'd just as well go to her home.

392
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:13,480
She'd go to her home and you'd be lying around here.

393
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,526
When did I say I'd be lying around here?

394
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,827
Do you want me to talk to your Dad?

395
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,157
To Dad?

396
00:22:20,157 --> 00:22:21,666
Why?

397
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,127
What will you say?

398
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:26,217
He should know too

399
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:29,657
That his sweet little girl is thinking about the entire family now.

400
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:30,678
Also,

401
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:33,943
You'd better not show me that you're certifiable.

402
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,737
I used to act up like this

403
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:39,537
When I was stopped from marrying your Dad.

404
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,082
Act up?

405
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:42,269
Don't worry.

406
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:46,548
Your Dad's picked up a lead, and he'll dig something up about him in a few days.

407
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:48,072
About whom?

408
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:50,638
As if you don't even remember his name!

409
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,348
You're talking about Afzal?

410
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:53,847
Of course.

411
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,009
Why is Dad looking for him?

412
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:00,479
Has the doctor prescribed any medicines or just shooed away after taking his fees?

413
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,289
He didn't prescribe any medicine.

414
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,588
In fact, he said I'm perfectly fine when he heard my history.

415
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:06,199
He's lied to you.

416
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:09,399
But he's told your Dad the truth.

417
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,428
Please, listen to me!

418
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:12,319
I --

419
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,319
I've made a promise.

420
00:23:14,597 --> 00:23:16,075
Whom have you promised?

421
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,335
And what have you promised?

422
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,805
I walked up to the terrace

423
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:22,705
She was on the swing singing a song from 'Ram Leela'!

424
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:24,115
What's 'Ram Leela'?

425
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:26,370
Deepika's film!

426
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:30,800
I'll tell her Dad --
-What's the need?

427
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,330
Don't you remember that you'd said,

428
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,749
'When a girl sits all alone, singing',

429
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:37,049
'She's yearning to get married'.

430
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:37,939
Well,

431
00:23:37,939 --> 00:23:40,162
You've even proven this adage false!

432
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:41,390
Neither did you sit all alone,

433
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,489
Nor sang a song,

434
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,799
And dropped the bombshell that was Molvi Subhanallah's son on us.

435
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,629
Anyway,

436
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:51,960
I'll listen to the song from 'Ram Leela' from her!

437
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:52,960
Go now,

438
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,700
And have faith, instead of thinking of unnecessary things,

439
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,524
That in a few days,

440
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,213
He'd be back at the crossroads around here.

441
00:24:00,213 --> 00:24:02,402
Or perhaps gambling on a match

442
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:05,963
With the old colony lads.

443
00:24:33,336 --> 00:24:34,786
Here.

444
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,153
Put your book down and have this before it cools down.

445
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:39,393
Here.

446
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:42,294
Right,

447
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:44,093
So what were you saying?

448
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,434
What was I saying?

449
00:24:45,434 --> 00:24:46,503
The same

450
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:49,236
You were telling me about Afzal's wife.

451
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:51,080
For the love of God, Mum,

452
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,703
I'd told you he's not gotten married yet

453
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,904
And that he has no girlfriend either.

454
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:57,193
Girlfriend?

455
00:24:57,193 --> 00:25:00,433
I mean, he's not having an affair with any girl either.

456
00:25:00,604 --> 00:25:02,833
When did you ask him this one?

457
00:25:03,594 --> 00:25:07,598
I asked everything when I'd brought him his tea.

458
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,458
Why?

459
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,298
Hey!

460
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:11,578
It's because you'd said

461
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:14,528
He'd be married or have found a girl.

462
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,438
So I thought I'd better ask.

463
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,598
I should know, too,

464
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:20,911
If your guesses are correct or you just say what you feel like.

465
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,411
What'll you do now?

466
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,280
I mean, what are you up to?

467
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,250
What would I be up to?

468
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,915
I'm just asking.

469
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:33,789
What should I do if he suddenly disappears one day?

470
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,940
He's deposited some advance for now.

471
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,880
We don't need to get worried.

472
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,359
Besides, he's a Molvi's son; he won't defraud.

473
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:42,459
I'll have two or three delicacies cooked tomorrow.

474
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,464
Why three?

475
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:44,660
Surely, two would be enough!

476
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,886
One, chicken, and two, some vegetables and lentils.

477
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:49,185
Desserts just once a week.

478
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:51,180
And the same old 8,000 a month.

479
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:55,300
What's with the month, Mum, it'll go by in a flash!

480
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,909
Who could it be at this hour?

481
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:58,319
Who else could it be?

482
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,920
Wali won't be coming now.

483
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,950
It'll be one of the tenants, or perhaps Samina.

484
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,450
I'll have a look.

485
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,710
I've brought sweets!

486
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,920
Just so little?

487
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,720
Why, though?

488
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,210
Oh God!

489
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,840
You haven't gotten married, have you?

490
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,180
Not at all!

491
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,520
I haven't gotten married.

492
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,780
I've gotten a job.

493
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:26,257
God bless you!

494
00:26:26,257 --> 00:26:27,647
Thank you!

495
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:28,897
Where have you gotten a job?

496
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:31,847
I mean -- what's your designation?

497
00:26:39,146 --> 00:26:41,146
Just a pastime?

498
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,730
Just a pastime.

499
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,330
Hello there!

500
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,639
Why are you sleeping here?

501
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,880
Just --

502
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:19,386
No idea.

503
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,179
You forgot your promise, didn't you?

504
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,789
Promise?

505
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,349
You'd said it firmly last night,

506
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,822
'I'll talk to Mum about you and Afzal'.

507
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:35,009
'In fact, I'll get him here from Karachi and get the two of you married'!

508
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,153
There!

509
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:38,102
Chickened out, eh?

510
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:42,642
One needs guts to stand by someone, Mademoiselle Farah Ibrahim!

511
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:43,702
Remember

512
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:47,002
I'd put my life on the line for you!

513
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,443
I'd talked to her.

514
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:50,783
Hey!

515
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,192
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,443
Stay back when you talk!

517
00:27:57,106 --> 00:27:58,937
Did she agree to it?

518
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,307
I don't know

519
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:03,787
Whether she'll agree to it or kill you!

520
00:28:03,787 --> 00:28:06,877
For now, I've just said you want to get married!

521
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:08,930
I've not named Afzal.

522
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,037
Why not?

523
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,898
You're actually saying

524
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:14,948
That I should mention him by name?

525
00:28:14,948 --> 00:28:16,148
Hey!

526
00:28:16,148 --> 00:28:17,928
Do you still doubt me?

527
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:19,388
Come on, Farah.

528
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:21,837
I'm very serious.

529
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:24,410
In fact,

530
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,487
I'm thinking of getting Afzal's name

531
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:29,507
Tattooed on my arm!

532
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,500
Honestly though,

533
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,771
It did occur to me

534
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,138
That you'd not be able to name him.

535
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,597
The thing is,

536
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:39,238
I know your problem very well.

537
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,067
What's my problem?

538
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,017
You do have one, Farah.

539
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,458
It's just yesterday

540
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,657
That your marriage to Afzal was being planned.

541
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,567
And now, out of the blue, you'd name me,

542
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:50,957
And Mum and Dad would get to know the true story,

543
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,047
It would knock them for six for sure.

544
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:55,177
What's the true story?

545
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:57,877
Do I have to say it over and over again?

546
00:28:57,877 --> 00:28:58,657
Alright,

547
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:01,522
I'll tell you everything when I'm back from the University.

548
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,788
Oh God, I'm late!

549
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:04,848
I'd better get going. Have a good day!

550
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,962
Wait.

551
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:29,482
Yes, Mum?

552
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:32,542
Was Farah telling me the truth?

553
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,649
What did she say?

554
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:39,743
You were on the terrace last night singing songs from 'Ram Leela'?

555
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,312
How's the film?

556
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,810
It was great --

557
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,844
No, Mum, it ain't good --

558
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:49,120
I haven't watched the film.

559
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,760
Just listened to the song.

560
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:54,340
Come back from the University,

561
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,349
And we'll talk.

562
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:57,210
Alright.

563
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,121
Bye.

564
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:24,425
I'll lose 40-50 million but go on with the business!

565
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,130
Peace be upon you, sir.

566
00:30:43,065 --> 00:30:45,762
Did I forget to greet you, sir?

567
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,655
I think I did.

568
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,575
Remember me?

569
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,070
No, sir?

570
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,327
I remember meeting you but I don't remember where.

571
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,040
Yes, sir.

572
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,959
Look here.

573
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,090
Remember me?

574
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,189
No, sir...

575
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,910
The name's Mehtab.

576
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,290
Right, sir.

577
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,880
You still don't remember me?

578
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm trying to, sir.

579
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:24,135
What's your name?

580
00:31:24,135 --> 00:31:26,059
Afzal.

581
00:31:26,904 --> 00:31:28,584
Afzal...

582
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:30,314
What happened, M. Mehtab?

583
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,815
It's nothing.

584
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,722
Peace be upon you, sir.

585
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,480
You're the same, aren't you?

586
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,940
The same, sir?

587
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,420
We met at Sheikh Ibrahim Uncle's!

588
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,836
Do you remember now?

589
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,129
Listen!

590
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,930
I watched Ram Leela in the afternoon.

591
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,300
It isn't the kind of film you twits should be watching!

592
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,230
It isn't the kind of film you should be watching either.

593
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,200
And -- I didn't watch it, Mum --

594
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,030
Just listened to the song.

595
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,900
I sang it because I found it good.

596
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,620
It was good that your Dad wasn't home!

597
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,060
Otherwise, I would've said that I'm watching it because of Lubna.

598
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,260
God forgive...

599
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,900
But the song was good.

600
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,970
Wasn't it?

601
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,120
Put a sock in it!

602
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
Don't sing it again.

603
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,810
You'd be doomed if Dad heard it!

604
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,160
What does Dad know it's from Ram Leela?

605
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,720
Leave that be.

606
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,510
He'd have watched it already.

607
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,400
Anyway,

608
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,050
You were on the terrace, singing, weren't you?

609
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,230
Yes...

610
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:04,186
What are you up to?

611
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:05,590
Up to --?

612
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,006
I'm your mother.

613
00:33:08,006 --> 00:33:10,239
My hair haven't turned grey,

614
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,136
But I'm experienced enough to know the signs of girls who sing songs sitting all alone like that.

615
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:15,476
Tell me,

616
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:19,076
If you are in love with a boy too, tell me his name.

617
00:33:19,076 --> 00:33:21,582
I'll talk to your Dad today.

618
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,196
For God's sake, Mum --

619
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:26,416
So do you intend to hide it for a year or so too?

620
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,612
Look, my dear,

621
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:30,726
The two of us are used to taking such shocks.

622
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:35,617
You can't put the wind up us by naming any stone broke dosser!

623
00:33:35,617 --> 00:33:40,916
Name any lad who isn't even 'Afzal' [the best] in name.

624
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:42,832
Shall we talk tomorrow?

625
00:33:42,832 --> 00:33:44,002
Tomorrow?

626
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:45,911
Alright, we'll talk tomorrow.

627
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,444
But remember

628
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,581
The lad should be a real one.

629
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:53,818
Don't hire someone for 200,000 and present him before us.

630
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:55,268
No way, Mum --

631
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:56,678
I won't do anything like that.

632
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:58,517
I promise.

633
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,194
So you've handpicked him!

634
00:34:03,194 --> 00:34:04,444
That's great.

635
00:34:04,444 --> 00:34:06,034
Long live my daughters.

636
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:10,119
You've taken up your father's responsibilities with such timing!

637
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:12,309
May I go?
-Go.

638
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:16,864
Warn me an hour before naming the lad tomorrow.

639
00:34:16,864 --> 00:34:17,864
Warn?

640
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:23,094
Just give me a hint that you'd be naming him in an hour.

641
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,701
And why is that, Mum?

642
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,738
What if the doctor is busy at that time?

643
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:27,943
No way!

644
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:32,144
Your Dad's blood pressure shoots up in minutes.

645
00:34:32,144 --> 00:34:34,073
It won't come to that.

646
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:39,804
It's screaming to come to that, but you can't hear it. Go.

647
00:34:39,804 --> 00:34:41,814
And keep on singing -- whatsit,

648
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,476
'I've tasted blood'!

649
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:45,618
God forgive!

650
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:08,956
Don't come in!

651
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,650
And don't you dare touch the door to my room without my permission!

652
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,199
Talk only from where you are!

653
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,310
Call out to me right from there.

654
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,390
I'll only talk if I'm in the mood to,

655
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,091
Otherwise, you don't need to call out a second time.

656
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:26,323
You're picking up a quarrel with me!

657
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:28,499
That's what's to be decided now, Lubna Ibrahim -

658
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:31,010
Whether I'm picking up a quarrel with you or you are with me!

659
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,810
Then you, too, should only call out to me standing at my doorstep.

660
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,952
I'll only talk if I'm in the mood to,

661
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:38,445
Otherwise, you don't need to call out a second time.

662
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:41,690
'Come to your doorstep' my foot!

663
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,310
Ohh...

664
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,979
I can understand everything...

665
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,449
Everything.

666
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,190
I should be of help to you

667
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,609
Even as you feign love,

668
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,310
And you'll cumber the path

669
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,430
Of my true love?

670
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,700
Splendid!

671
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,940
You truly love him?

672
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,760
The one who came with a proposal to marry your sister?

673
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,799
Hello?

674
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,641
All of that was an act.

675
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:06,285
You were playing your part, as was he!

676
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:09,899
He wasn't just playing his part. He'd actually brought his parents.

677
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:12,090
And that -- Engagement ring...

678
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,220
Do you remember?

679
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,170
I'd even texted him a message to mark the end of the job and his love!

680
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,721
So you think

681
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,590
He had begun to love you?

682
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,720
Well,

683
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,939
I wouldn't call it love.

684
00:36:23,939 --> 00:36:26,280
The blighter used to have an exchange of letters with someone,

685
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,829
And wanted to marry me!
-Please, Farah!

686
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:31,629
Don't cast such an aspersion on my Afzal!

687
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:34,019
On your Afzal?

688
00:36:34,019 --> 00:36:35,990
He's yours now?

689
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,029
He will be.

690
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,110
When you yearn for someone so ardently,

691
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,769
He cannot end up anywhere else.

692
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:43,938
But

693
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:47,778
What do you know about ardent yearning!

694
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:11,224
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

695
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:14,820
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

696
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:20,787
<i>Slumbering in my veins, it has now awakened...</i>

697
00:37:20,787 --> 00:37:24,442
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

698
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:29,833
<i>Slumbering in my veins, it has now awakened...</i>

699
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:34,427
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

700
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:40,445
<i>I've tasted blood...</i>

701
00:38:39,308 --> 00:38:40,796
Listen!

702
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Where to?
-To Samina's.

703
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,800
Today's her wedding anniversary.

704
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,133
As in, it's been another year.

705
00:38:50,133 --> 00:38:52,876
Is hers the kind of wedding one would commemorate?

706
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,805
Her husband does every year.

707
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:56,953
After all, it's her husband's 'love marriage' to her.

708
00:38:56,953 --> 00:39:01,955
In two years of this 'love marriage', she's been beaten by her 'lover' some 200 times!

709
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:04,523
Only God will ask about this.

710
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,365
What will you give her as a gift?

711
00:39:06,365 --> 00:39:07,977
Why would she need one?

712
00:39:07,977 --> 00:39:10,396
She has a far greater need for cash.

713
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,183
I'm thinking I'd give her a thousand.

714
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,506
And who will get the security guard his food?

715
00:39:15,506 --> 00:39:17,513
I'll be back before he is.

716
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,393
And who'll tell you he's back?

717
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:21,583
Well,

718
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,317
I get to know

719
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:25,963
The moment he sets foot in the alley!

720
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,770
May I go now?

721
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:32,376
Yes.

722
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:33,996
Go.

723
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,478
But please do tell me when you're back

724
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:44,407
How you get to know the moment he sets foot in the alley.

725
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:49,777
