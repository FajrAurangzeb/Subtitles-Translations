1
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:13,646
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:23,903
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,903 --> 00:00:30,388
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:35,927
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:40,537
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:43,808
Hello?

8
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,172
You're still awake, aren't you?

9
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,040
Yes.

10
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,619
Just stay awake.

11
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:49,537
I've found out about the lass.

12
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:50,824
Who is it?

13
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,728
Yasmin.

14
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,174
Yasmin?

15
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:55,937
I've agreed, beaut.

16
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,307
I thought that the blighter's adamant,

17
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:02,026
And he may pick any Mary, Jane or Susie in this chaos,

18
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:05,853
So, I've decided to sacrifice my principles.

19
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:08,571
Besides, there aren't any principles in love, are there, Farah?

20
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:09,591
There's

21
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,124
Just love.

22
00:03:05,206 --> 00:03:06,566
Farah!

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,200
Farah Ibrahim!

24
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:15,311
Why are you sleeping here?

25
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm not sleeping...

26
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:24,477
I was just sitting here, waiting

27
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:28,379
For you to get up so I could tell you what's happened in Karachi last night.

28
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,097
Target killing?

29
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:32,107
Yes, target killing.

30
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,028
Have a lot of people died?

31
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,701
A lot of dreams have been killed.

32
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,002
Those of the Farah who used to write those letters,

33
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,429
Those of Lubna Ibrahim...

34
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:46,995
That wee lassie's clawed the eyes of both of you out.

35
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:49,245
'Wee lassie'? Who?

36
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,391
Hold it, Lubna Ibrahim,

37
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,839
If I told you in one shot,

38
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,488
You'll have a heart attack.

39
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:55,738
I won't.

40
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,436
Tell me whom you're talking about,

41
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,010
And while you're at it, tell me

42
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,036
Who the killer of my dreams is.

43
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:04,197
Yasmin Afzal.

44
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,376
Yasmin or Afzal?

45
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:09,547
Yasmin is going to become Yasmin Afzal.

46
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:11,263
They're getting engaged today.

47
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:12,609
Hey!

48
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:15,491
So he's actually getting engaged to Yasmin?

49
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,829
But you'd told me that Yasmin had refused?

50
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,627
I'd also said that she's proper cheeky.

51
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:22,893
She was saying proudly yesterday,

52
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:24,424
'I refused',

53
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:26,307
But she called me the next hour, saying,

54
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,360
'I've agreed'.

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,139
Right...

56
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,894
Should I give you her number?

57
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:37,472
What for?

58
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,420
Call her and say some of the finest four-letter words!

59
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,487
The blighter --

60
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:43,003
Dodgy lass -- riggish --

61
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,236
Hey!

62
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:45,734
However is she riggish?

63
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,791
She's marrying the one she loves.

64
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:50,248
And Afzal's proposed her, which means

65
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,044
The love isn't one-sided.

66
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,580
The thing is,

67
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,725
It's hurt me very much,

68
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:02,033
But one doesn't insult lovers.

69
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,690
It'd have killed you to hear...

70
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,315
Obviously...

71
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:08,324
But what could be done now?

72
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:09,455
The blighter...

73
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:12,574
He was never destined for me...

74
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:14,941
Make a vow.

75
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:16,544
For what?

76
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:20,320
Say that you'd offer 100 extra prayers if the engagement breaks.

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,374
One who has a heart herself

78
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,710
Couldn't possibly curse anyone with heartbreak.

79
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,023
In fact,

80
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:28,969
I'd pray now

81
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,497
That the two live together,

82
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,479
And always remain happy.

83
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:37,217
They'd not remain happy, that's for sure.

84
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:38,623
Your heart's been broken.

85
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,172
It'd have consequences.

86
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:42,733
You'll see.

87
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,189
She'd weep

88
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:46,049
Facing Hyderabad.

89
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:46,962
Now,

90
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,829
You shouldn't curse either.

91
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,295
I'm not cursing her.

92
00:05:50,295 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm telling you where the 'love' of such dodgy girls leads them.

93
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,940
The blighter

94
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,368
Changes girls when he changes cities.

95
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:58,944
He's not the type.

96
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,719
He'd left Hyderabad, defeated,

97
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,738
He'd have thought he'd return from Karachi victorious.

98
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:10,813
He'd be victorious to get engaged to Yasmin?

99
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:13,378
Whatever is this Yasmin?

100
00:06:13,378 --> 00:06:14,985
A lippy BA pass.

101
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,860
She doesn't even have the manners of how to behave and talk!

102
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,050
Engagements can be broken,

103
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,580
But if he got married,

104
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,127
Not a victor,

105
00:06:23,127 --> 00:06:26,386
He'd be bitterly defeated on that day.

106
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:32,997
Who'd defeat him if he came back a victor in love?

107
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:38,987
Farah Ibrahim, or the Farah who used to write him letters?

108
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:10,114
How long have you been sitting here?

109
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,929
Ever since she called.

110
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,509
Forget her.

111
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,716
Take a pill and sleep.

112
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:26,245
Just think you've gotten the news of a target killing from Karachi.

113
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:31,661
Such incidents happen over there every now and then.

114
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:35,340
Don't grieve over it too much.

115
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,564
I won't.

116
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:41,284
Just think you've caught a news story from Karachi.

117
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:44,174
No idea who's died.

118
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,270
You've died, Farah Ibrahim.

119
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,350
Don't take it - seeing that I've come

120
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,866
On the day of the engagement -

121
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,093
That I woke up, thinking

122
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,811
That I ought to invite you, too.

123
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,943
I've only invited you.

124
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,861
I'd told her there's no need to go.

125
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:19,776
She would've invited herself.

126
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:21,120
Yes...

127
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,905
She's had us promise we'd come.

128
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,012
Molvi Sahab was asking before he went to bed,

129
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,603
'What should I wear tomorrow'?

130
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,385
We haven't had anything new made...

131
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,271
Why would we need anything new?

132
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:39,840
We'd wear the same that we'd worn to the pretence of an engagement.

133
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,950
It was a new one then.

134
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:49,562
Anyway... So, what time have you fixed?

135
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,326
I mean, when's the engagement?

136
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,656
After the dusk prayer.

137
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,953
The Lord's willed it [Great].

138
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,348
It's such an auspicious time.

139
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,998
Where's Molvi Sahab, Madame?

140
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:07,434
She'd sent him to get some sweets in the morning.

141
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:11,031
He was just left asking what the sweets are for.

142
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:13,828
Yes, Arifa, what are the sweets for?

143
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,162
I'll tell you, too, when he's brought the sweets.

144
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,818
Everyone here has a penchant for surprises...

145
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:20,731
Like father,

146
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:23,039
Like daughter...

147
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,206
And like the blessed son...

148
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,540
That rapscallion gave me a right surprise, too...

149
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:39,320
What about the wedding? Is it this year?

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,209
It'll be this year, if the Lord wills.

151
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,365
If the Lord wills.

152
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,172
Arifa!

153
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:47,808
Arifa! I've brought sweets.

154
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,504
Here.

155
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:55,511
Oh! Praise the Lord... Such honoured people have come here!

156
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,892
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

157
00:09:58,892 --> 00:09:59,941
How are you, Molvi Sahab?

158
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,128
Thank the Lord [I'm fine].

159
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,277
Peace be upon you, Madame.

160
00:10:03,277 --> 00:10:04,810
And upon you, peace.

161
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,620
We'd just been waiting for you.

162
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,578
In the Lord's name [Pray tell].

163
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,047
It's just

164
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,622
That she'd

165
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:13,598
Sent me to get sweets -

166
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:14,370
Sit -

167
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,406
Otherwise,

168
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,881
I'm usually at home.

169
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,957
You've come to invite us to Farah's engagement, haven't you?

170
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:24,041
Yes.

171
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,448
There!

172
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:29,537
So you'd have to say that, now!

173
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:31,754
Madame,

174
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:35,972
I've never felt that she's your daughter.

175
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:38,756
She has a place here.

176
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,342
In my heart.

177
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:44,691
I await her coming all the time...

178
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,941
Thinking when she'd come...

179
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:52,845
And he treats her to coconut biscuits when she comes!

180
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,302
She's your daughter, Molvi Sahab.

181
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:02,302
It's just that she couldn't be yours, or, I'd thought I'd meet her here.

182
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,479
Oh...

183
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,280
Forget about that...

184
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,240
Here, Uncle. Have some sweets.

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,775
Oh, Arifa! We forgot about the sweets entirely.

186
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,275
Alright.

187
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,619
Pray tell, now, what it's for.

188
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:28,066
Our Afzal's getting engaged today.

189
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,748
I mean,

190
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:45,145
It's his engageent today, too.

191
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,310
What've you just said?

192
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,602
Were you lying to scare them or terrifying your Mum?

193
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,499
I'm not lying.

194
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,089
He's getting engaged today.

195
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,656
He's actually getting engaged.

196
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,009
It's his old landlady's daughter;

197
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,077
He's getting engaged to her.

198
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,501
Her name's Yasmin.

199
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,922
Swear by me.

200
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,097
I swear by you.

201
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,488
The artful blighter...

202
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:40,091
How easily he can ensnare a girl...

203
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:49,173
Well, I'd always known that he'd give a befitting reply to Farah one day.

204
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,133
He's given one.

205
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,364
You'll see,

206
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:55,172
He'll get engaged after dusk.

207
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:58,288
She'd wear the ring here,

208
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:01,271
And he'd put the ring on her there.

209
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,058
Good morning, Dad.

210
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,799
Good morning.

211
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,667
We'd gone over to Afzal's.

212
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,447
We've invited them to the engagement.

213
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:18,946
Take these sweets.

214
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:21,202
Arifa's sent these.

215
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:29,383
They're celebrating Farah's engagement?

216
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:33,660
She's celebrating her brother's engagement.

217
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,601
Give some to her, too.

218
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,122
Hello?

219
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:21,378
Farah?

220
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:22,940
No, it's Lubna.

221
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,686
Farah's sleeping.

222
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,232
It's 10!

223
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,766
She went to bed at 8 a.m.

224
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:31,506
Ask her to call when she gets up.

225
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:32,912
Everything's alright, innit?

226
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:34,056
I

227
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:37,595
Wanted my sister-in-law's number from her.

228
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,615
Sister-in-law?

229
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:42,139
I'm talking about Yasmin, Lubna.

230
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,039
Oh...

231
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:48,018
Mum's so eager to talk to her.

232
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,087
Wait, I'll wake her up.

233
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:51,770
No.

234
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,530
There's no hurry, really.

235
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,556
Let her sleep.

236
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:57,905
Stay on the line.

237
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:01,783
Perhaps it is time for her to get up.

238
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,306
Farah!

239
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,624
Farah!

240
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:07,557
Farah!

241
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:09,357
Aye -- Has the wedding procession gotten here?

242
00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:10,564
Get a grip on your senses, Farah.

243
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,580
No wedding procession comes on engagements.

244
00:15:13,921 --> 00:15:16,298
Here's some sweets for you.

245
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:17,506
From whom?

246
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:19,286
Afzal's family.

247
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:23,791
Arifa and her Mum are celebrating the engagement.

248
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:26,030
Arifa's on the line.

249
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,566
She wants her sister-in-law's cell number.

250
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:30,032
Sister-in-law?

251
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,532
Yasmin, of course.

252
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,948
Here. Talk to her.

253
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:41,755
Hello, Arifa.

254
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:43,814
Peace be upon you.

255
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:45,172
And upon you, peace.

256
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,210
Sorry for waking you up.

257
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,124
No...

258
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:49,345
It's okay.

259
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,287
Ever since

260
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,083
Mum's found out, she's not calmed down.

261
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,112
She's been saying again and again, 'Get her number'.

262
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:57,164
Ah, right...

263
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,006
I have her number.

264
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,100
Listen,

265
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,206
You've met her, haven't you?

266
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:03,827
Yes.

267
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,188
How does she look?

268
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:06,671
Also, tell me,

269
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,773
What does her voice sound like?

270
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:10,287
She sounds sweet, doesn't she?

271
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:11,877
Yes, she does.

272
00:16:11,877 --> 00:16:14,071
She must look very comely.

273
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,613
She does.

274
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:19,201
I'd said the moment I'd heard it, 'She'd be very comely, Mum'!

275
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:23,527
As lively and jovial like a sparrow jigging about!

276
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:26,324
Give me her number, will you?

277
00:16:26,324 --> 00:16:28,367
I'll text you.

278
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,110
And

279
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,716
Have the sweets, too.

280
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:33,648
It's been sent specially for you.

281
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:35,254
I'll have some.

282
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:36,846
I'll disconnect.

283
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,533
Disconnect...

284
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,255
She was thumbing her nose at me.

285
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,542
She was saying everything herself,

286
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,916
'She's very comely, isn't she'?

287
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,729
'Her voice would sound sweet, too'...

288
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:52,170
So, isn't she comely?

289
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,823
Doesn't she sound so sweet?

290
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,431
She may be.

291
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:59,171
She can talk to her and taste her sweetness for herself.

292
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,298
And look at that,

293
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:02,246
She's deriding me, saying,

294
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,728
'She'd be lively and jovial'

295
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:07,422
'Like a sparrow jigging about'!

296
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:09,596
The blighter's calling a hawk a sparrow!

297
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:11,401
At least text her the number.

298
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm doing it.

299
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,759
Leave that be.

300
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,301
I won't have the sweets.

301
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,912
But I will.

302
00:17:21,912 --> 00:17:24,662
I'm opening them for myself.

303
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,291
Hold it,

304
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,581
Hold it, Ruqaiyya Begum!

305
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,183
He's not given you any such happiness,

306
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,706
That you feast on sweets to death.

307
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:10,804
You've already had half a kilogramme.

308
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:15,447
I'd thought your heart would be thunderstruck today.

309
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:19,226
It's your Afzal's engagement today,

310
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:22,089
And he hasn't even invited you!

311
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:25,720
Well, I do feel sad about that,

312
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,817
But my happiness is far greater, Molvi Sahab.

313
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,682
He'd have thought at least once,

314
00:18:34,682 --> 00:18:38,206
But your judgement must've scared him...

315
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:41,692
Which judgement are you talking about?

316
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:44,393
You brand him a sinner just like that.

317
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:45,986
You'd be thundering right now

318
00:18:45,986 --> 00:18:48,709
Had he invited us to his engagement.

319
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,910
'I won't attend that sinner's engagement'!

320
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,025
Have some shame, Ruqaiyya Begum.

321
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,560
He didn't even ask you.

322
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,660
He picked a girl on his own,

323
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,825
And he's going to put the ring on her himself.

324
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:05,003
In all honesty,

325
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:10,660
This is cause enough for us to die of shame.

326
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,278
I'm thinking of writing a letter of disownment,

327
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:21,149
And having it published in every newspaper in Karachi before the evening.

328
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,281
Mum...

329
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,875
I've gotten her number.

330
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,625
Whose number have you gotten?

331
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,240
My sister-in-law's.

332
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,518
Hello?

333
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,338
It's Yasmin, innit?

334
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:19,071
Yes; who are you?

335
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,771
I'm from Hyderabad.

336
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:21,590
Venture a guess

337
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,738
Who it could be.

338
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:24,282
Farah!

339
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:25,877
No...

340
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:27,616
This isn't Farah's voice.

341
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:28,386
Yes,

342
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:30,939
It isn't Farah's voice.

343
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,713
Are you Afzal's sister,

344
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:34,227
Arifa?

345
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,287
Mum!

346
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:37,586
She's recognised me!

347
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,591
Give me the phone.

348
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,601
I'll talk to her.

349
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,456
Alright, tell me now,

350
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:44,562
Who am I?

351
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,747
Afzal's Mam.

352
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:47,614
There!

353
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,206
She's recognised me, too!

354
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:51,567
Honestly, my dear,

355
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,720
Do you have a special skill?

356
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,988
Is this knowledge because of your craft, or just guesswork?

357
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:00,315
I mean, I'd heard that ascetics can tell one's name from one's voice,

358
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:04,790
But never that lovers could be ascetics.

359
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:11,033
She's head over heels for Afzal!

360
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,338
Tell me, you're fair and comely, aren't you?

361
00:21:19,338 --> 00:21:21,980
Come and see me.

362
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,795
How could I come when the rapscallion's not invited me...

363
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,929
It does sound like you are...

364
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,587
You're no less than Hyderabadis.

365
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,177
Let me talk to your Mum.

366
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:36,270
She's gone to the lapidary to get my jewellery polished.

367
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:38,903
She called the jeweller 'lapidary'.

368
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:41,519
She knows her English!

369
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:46,064
Who's there in your family besides your Mum?

370
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:48,011
Just my Mam and I.

371
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:49,755
Oh...

372
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,422
Didn't you ask him to bring his Mum and Dad along

373
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:54,816
If he's going to get engaged to you?

374
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,423
I did feel like saying that,

375
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,212
But I got scared.

376
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,654
Why were you scared?

377
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:03,385
I was scared that he may change his intentions.

378
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:04,824
Just let us get engaged,

379
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,075
I'll ask him after that.

380
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,373
In fact, I'll not say that;

381
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:10,615
I'd come over and bring Mam along.

382
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:14,056
You're saying that to make me happy, aren't you?

383
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:16,524
I like you this way.

384
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:18,441
Alright,

385
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:20,728
Talk to Arifa.

386
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:24,113
There's just the four of us over here,

387
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,072
My Mum,

388
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:25,752
Dad,

389
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,918
My brother, and I.

390
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:31,617
My brother's in Karachi, so take it

391
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,933
That there's 3 and 3 quarters of us.

392
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,867
3 and 3 quarters? How?

393
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:41,731
The three of us try our best to fill his absence through our memories of him.

394
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:45,294
That's why there's 3 and 3 quarters of us,

395
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,615
But not 4.

396
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:11,594
I've seen him somewhere.

397
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,402
It's

398
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:16,040
It's the same MP, innit,

399
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,744
Who wears kurta-pyjamas,

400
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:21,130
And rides a bike to Parliament?

401
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,820
What do I do with him?

402
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,394
You have to kill him.

403
00:23:29,394 --> 00:23:32,300
He's an ace impostor.

404
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,606
He wears kurta-pyjamas and rides a bike to Parliament

405
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:39,006
To show the people.

406
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:41,977
I don't quite feel it's right.

407
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:46,815
Politicians today are great actors, M. Afzal.

408
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:48,392
They make one laugh

409
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:50,356
And cry as and when they want.

410
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:52,445
The people are so anguished

411
00:23:52,445 --> 00:23:55,228
That sometimes, you can just see it.

412
00:23:55,228 --> 00:23:57,404
The same anguish

413
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:01,803
Is heard later in the citizens' cries.

414
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:05,681
Don't fall for his tricks.

415
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:10,534
One who can make others cry can also impress.

416
00:24:15,197 --> 00:24:18,382
His performance doesn't end here.

417
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,578
He doesn't stay at the MPs' hostel.

418
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:23,772
He's rented a small apartment.

419
00:24:23,772 --> 00:24:27,477
He doesn't pay his rent for two months,

420
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:30,909
And hears the most vile insults from the landlord.

421
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:31,960
Then,

422
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,524
What good is killing such a man?

423
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:37,336
He barks like dogs in Parliament.

424
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:41,349
He says to honourable ministers, 'You are all looting the nation's money',

425
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,442
'You are all traitors'.

426
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:49,470
We have intelligence that he's working on someone's orders.

427
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,893
Whose orders?

428
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:52,704
Just think

429
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:55,884
That he's paid in Dollars to bark and insult.

430
00:24:55,884 --> 00:24:58,884
Where does he keep the Dollars?

431
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:04,200
That's something we'd find out after he's dead.

432
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:08,374
One finds out about all the property owned by such people

433
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:11,995
When it's to be divided among their heirs.

434
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:16,560
And such people get elected to Parliament.

435
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:20,750
In this bag

436
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,532
Is 20 million in fresh notes.

437
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:25,745
Fresh.

438
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:30,571
The demand is just so much that the murder should not look like one.

439
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:34,399
One can easily believe about such people

440
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,423
That, succumbing to mental illness, they've committed suicide.

441
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,370
What are you thinking?

442
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,120
I'm thinking why one would pay 20 million to kill a pigeon.

443
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:06,271
So we're going to kill a pigeon?

444
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:10,688
It's a man...

445
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:14,459
But the bugger's a proper pigeon...

446
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,822
Mr Zaki!

447
00:26:48,822 --> 00:26:50,151
Yes?

448
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,023
You have guests.

449
00:26:52,023 --> 00:26:54,062
Have them sit; I'm coming.

450
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:55,767
Alright.

451
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:15,997
Peace be upon you.

452
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:18,741
And upon you, peace.

453
00:27:19,363 --> 00:27:22,911
I'm sorry but I don't recognise you.

454
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:26,444
You don't seem to be from my constituency.

455
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,487
Do you recognise everyone from your constituency?

456
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,741
I don't recognise them by their names,

457
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,841
But I do, by their faces.

458
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:36,841
Pray tell what brings you here.

459
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:43,618
My name's Afzal.

460
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:44,854
Yes, Mr Afzal,

461
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:45,720
Pray tell

462
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,914
How I may be of help.

463
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:51,419
Be done with this act and tell me - who do you work for?

464
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,338
They don't let me work at all.

465
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:55,404
They stop me

466
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:56,729
If I say something,

467
00:27:56,729 --> 00:27:57,747
And scold me

468
00:27:57,747 --> 00:27:58,821
When I start working.

469
00:27:58,821 --> 00:28:00,810
Talk about yourself.

470
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,694
Tell me where you keep the Dollars.

471
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:06,046
And who pays you Dollars to speak for him in Parliament?

472
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:08,732
I can take the Dollars, too, if I want.

473
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:12,945
But the thought of disrespecting the Rupee scares me.

474
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:16,124
Who are you?

475
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:17,962
Get in the car.

476
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:20,036
Where'd you take me?

477
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,398
I'm sending you back.

478
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:25,134
Your time's up.

479
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,236
You could've come earlier.

480
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:29,089
I've been washing clothes for an hour.

481
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:30,869
Who'd wear them now?

482
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:32,085
Come. Please.

483
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,122
Come.

484
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:35,020
Wait.

485
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,240
Sit.

486
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:52,265
Aren't you afraid?

487
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:54,192
I am, yes...

488
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,695
If you address someone my age

489
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:59,764
With such disrespect,

490
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:01,835
I might as well die of shame!

491
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:03,811
So, it's better

492
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:05,712
That you do your job

493
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:08,634
Without all this insolence.

494
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:14,635
Tell me,

495
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:20,134
Why are they paying me 20 million to kill a twopenny man like you?

496
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,451
Go on.

497
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:29,478
If you address me so discourteously,

498
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,059
I won't answer.

499
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,175
Alright, I won't be discourteous.

500
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,498
Why do they want you dead, sir?

501
00:29:43,498 --> 00:29:45,826
And why are you not afraid to die?

502
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,549
I'd pursued an MA in Politics.

503
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,017
At the University,

504
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:52,531
They'd stress

505
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:55,049
Every lesson about democracy.

506
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:57,582
'Democracy is the rule of the people',

507
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,101
'By the people',

508
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:01,279
'For the people'.

509
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,320
It touched my heart,

510
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,808
So, I entered politics.

511
00:30:05,808 --> 00:30:08,590
I was an energetic orator.

512
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,885
I'd give

513
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,150
Vision to the people,

514
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,191
So, they fell for my tricks

515
00:30:13,191 --> 00:30:17,347
And they elected me with a lead of 54,000 votes.

516
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,852
I entered Parliament, burdened

517
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,767
With my promises and vision.

518
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:24,180
On the eighth day, I found out

519
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,186
That the definition of democracy I'd studied

520
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:29,643
Was incorrect.

521
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:31,522
The correct one is,

522
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:33,937
'Democracy is the rule of the feudals',

523
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,017
'By the feudals',

524
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,074
'And for the feudals'.

525
00:30:37,074 --> 00:30:40,294
The academic definition of Parliament is one thing --

526
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:42,864
Well, it isn't really relevant to you.

527
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:45,099
You've gotten your 20 million,

528
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:46,749
So, do your job,

529
00:30:46,749 --> 00:30:48,604
And have a jolly good time.

530
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:51,387
Even if I 'earn' 20 million,

531
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:53,349
I don't 'have a 'jolly good time', Mr Zaki.

532
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:55,345
Then, distribute your 20 million

533
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:58,115
Among the people of my constituency.

534
00:30:58,115 --> 00:30:59,270
By the Lord,

535
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,344
I'd commit suicide before you return.

536
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:04,103
It'd do your job,

537
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:06,282
And remove a thorn in their side.

538
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,786
And this will just be an excuse

539
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:12,361
To ease the pain of the those fools, the people of my constituency.

540
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:15,527
Otherwise, I'm usually sitting here, cowering,

541
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:19,882
Worried about how I'd face them.

542
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,470
Please get in the car.

543
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,463
I said, please get in the car.

544
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:16,649
Come.

545
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:22,421
Please, follow me.

546
00:32:26,397 --> 00:32:28,361
Take a seat.

547
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:54,904
There's 20 million in fresh notes in it.

548
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,780
Get in my car and go to your constituency from here,

549
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,240
And distribute this 20 million among 'those fools'

550
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,074
Who'd trusted your vision.

551
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:16,548
And sleep peacefully when you return,

552
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:20,083
And roar on in Parliament tomorrow, assured

553
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:25,536
That nobody can dare touch you as long as I'm alive.

554
00:33:27,285 --> 00:33:29,979
Who are you, my good sir?

555
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:39,735
I'm another one of 'those fools', waiting for 66 years for a leader who'd wash their own clothes,

556
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:46,725
And humbly listen to the landlord's insults for nor paying the rent for two months.

557
00:33:48,115 --> 00:33:51,304
Don't call me 'my good sir' if we meet again.

558
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:57,247
I'd feel that you've accorded me respect if you just call me 'my good man'.

559
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:04,018
This bag's rather heavy.

560
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:06,073
You'll need help lifting it.

561
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:08,967
So, I'm sending someone along.

562
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,591
Timmy!

563
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,960
Take this bag and put it in one of our cars,

564
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,268
And ask the driver to stay with him.

565
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,833
'Democracy is the rule of the people',

566
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,736
'For the people',

567
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,694
'By the people'.

568
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,888
Thank you.

569
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,389
Is it done?

570
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:10,520
We've begun.

571
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,866
It'll be done in a few years.

572
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:17,195
No, M. Afzal, we just have 72 hours.

573
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:21,708
Those who've been kind to you don't even have 4 hours, sir.

574
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,229
Please, tell them

575
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:28,385
That if there's so much as a crease on Zaki Ahmed's pyjamas because of them,

576
00:35:28,385 --> 00:35:32,942
I'll round them all up in a coffin.

577
00:35:33,896 --> 00:35:35,286
I'll disconnect.

578
00:35:35,286 --> 00:35:39,429
B --
-You can try me if you have any doubts.

579
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:01,054
The Lord's willed it [praise]!

580
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:02,969
May the evil gaze not touch you.

581
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,566
You look so sweet!

582
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:09,905
May the Lord protect you from every evil eye.

583
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:13,009
When would he be here?

584
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:15,034
After the dusk prayer.

585
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:16,411
Alright.

586
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,593
C'mon.

587
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,642
Sit.

588
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:20,588
Come, all of you.

589
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:23,251
Why don't you all take a seat?

590
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:46,656
They're here!

591
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,986
His Dad's dancing, too!

592
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:53,166
Do you know why he's dancing?

593
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,112
Because we've had dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] made!

594
00:37:55,112 --> 00:37:57,152
So we're serving dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] today?

595
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,160
We aren't serving just dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice].

596
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,998
It's just that we're serving dal chawal [Indian lentils and rice] too!

597
00:38:02,998 --> 00:38:04,294
Haven't they come?

598
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:05,795
They've all come.

599
00:38:05,795 --> 00:38:07,461
And he looks very dashing.

600
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:09,715
I'm not talking about him.

601
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:11,873
I'm talking about Arifa and the others.

602
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,449
They've not come yet.

603
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,982
Perhaps they've had a change of heart at the last moment?

604
00:38:15,982 --> 00:38:17,681
Hey!

605
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,039
Call Arifa.

606
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,017
Now's not the time to call.

607
00:38:22,017 --> 00:38:24,816
They'd come here if they want, or stay at home.

608
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,565
I'll get going!

609
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:57,426
Quickly, now,

610
00:38:57,426 --> 00:39:00,178
Be done with it already. The dusk prayer was quite a while ago!

611
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:02,358
Yes; just two more minutes.

612
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,146
Your two minutes have been going on for the last 15 minutes.

613
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:07,090
Go and see if Arifa's ready.

614
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,090
I'll be ready by the time she is.

615
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:11,815
Dad...

616
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:14,597
Here she is. You'd better come, now, too.
-Yes.

617
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:16,483
Take this, Dad.

618
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,407
Give this ring to her.

619
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,942
It's of no use to us now.

620
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:30,075
Whatever would she do with it, either?

621
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:31,315
Don't worry.

622
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,165
She'd only wear this one.

623
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,739
Let him know, too,

624
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,430
That the ring's gone up to her hand.

625
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,680
Alright, come.

626
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
