1
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:13,246
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:18,546
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:23,686
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:29,986
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:35,636
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:40,356
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:04,862
'Everything'?

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,749
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,632
Yes,

10
00:01:13,632 --> 00:01:15,492
So what's 'everything'?

11
00:01:15,532 --> 00:01:17,209
I wanted to say that

12
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,199
It is not meet, considering my status, that I love Farah,

13
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:24,739
But I have a right to love Farah.

14
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,510
Oh?

15
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,423
Who bestowed this right upon you?

16
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,800
No...

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,770
Nobody bestows this right,

18
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,510
Nor does anyone ask for it.

19
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,740
Or else, one would have to take permission before falling in love.

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,830
This would make a complete haymes of it all.

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,330
A complete haymes, as in?

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,510
As in, asking permission

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,900
Of the one you love first.

24
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,440
Mention your status,

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,900
And ask,

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,840
'May I love you'?

27
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:58,967
What would you take to just love her?

28
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,077
Another good question.

29
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,967
I've asked you something.

30
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:09,997
How much money would you take to spare her life?

31
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:16,527
The thing is, I've promised on oath to Dad I'd never gamble again.

32
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:19,437
I'm not talking about gambling.

33
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,577
You are talking about gambling.

34
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:24,029
But it seems you do not understand gambling.

35
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:26,097
My friend, Babloo,

36
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:29,767
He says, 'Win this match, and the money's all yours'.

37
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:33,847
And you're saying, 'Lose this match, and the money's all yours'.

38
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,907
There is no room for such match-fixing in love.

39
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:41,197
Love is all about striving all your life and dying for its sake.

40
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:42,920
You play to win

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,997
Even if it gets heavy on the pocket.

42
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:49,217
It seems your mind doesn't quite work.

43
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,967
You're talking like Dad!

44
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,727
Whenever I used to score third division marks on my exams,

45
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:56,467
Dad would say,

46
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:58,667
'Look at this, Ruqaiyya'!

47
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,797
'It seems your son has not a brain in his skull'!

48
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:04,917
Ruqaiyya is my Mum's name.

49
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:07,417
Your family must be chuffed.

50
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:11,277
You've trapped such a good and wealthy girl.

51
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,007
Isn't it so?

52
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:19,527
This line is not worthy of my reply.

53
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:24,447
If you have any other questions, please do ask. Otherwise, I would take my leave.

54
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:28,427
To be honest, I'm rather furious at this.

55
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,773
Thank you very much.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,080
You gave me a chance to speak my heart out.

57
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,630
But your last question wasn't nice.

58
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,114
Regardless,

59
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:45,148
I'd like to tell you as I leave

60
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:49,431
Nobody in my family knows that I love Farah.

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,600
With peace.

62
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,410
He came and left?

63
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,650
Yes.

64
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,673
But

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,279
I'd said he should leave only after meeting me.

66
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,659
You met with so much jewellery on?

67
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:22,979
He must've been frightened.

68
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,109
No.

69
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:26,609
The wretch doesn't fear anything.

70
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,639
Answered me back rather artfully on everything!

71
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,609
It is today that I realised how torturous it is to be the mother of a girl

72
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:37,409
Who's fallen for a right dosser from the neighbourhood.

73
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,189
Did you call him a dosser too?

74
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,049
I didn't.

75
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:45,649
But it occurred to me every now and then - whom am I talking to, and about what!

76
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:47,370
What happened?

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,292
Did he not agree to a million?

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,629
He left, calling me a gambler!

79
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,319
How dare he!

80
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,969
He said you're a gambler?

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,439
When I asked him how much he'd take to spare Farah's life, he said he'd promised his father.

82
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,079
'I'll never gamble again'.

83
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,960
When did he call you a gambler?

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,849
When I said, 'I'm not talking about gambling'.

85
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:15,044
He said, 'You are talking about gambling'.

86
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:17,609
'But it seems you do not understand gambling'.

87
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,443
He said, 'My friend, Babloo',

88
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:20,789
'He says',

89
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,109
''Win the match','

90
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:23,189
''And the money's all yours'.'

91
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,469
'And you're saying',

92
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:25,831
''Lose the match','

93
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,599
''And the money's all yours'.'

94
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,729
He's actually called you a gambler!

95
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,569
Don't be angry over it.

96
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll see to it.

97
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,079
And where are both the girls?

98
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,719
Upstairs.

99
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:44,409
I'd asked them not to come downstairs

100
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,289
Until he's left.

101
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,366
Good.

102
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:51,647
And yes,

103
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:54,227
That line about Babloo was perfect!

104
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:56,167
Mum would've had a canary at that moment!

105
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,157
Canary?

106
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,347
In Eire,

107
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,587
You 'have a canary' when you get all worked up!

108
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:01,677
To be quite honest,

109
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:03,707
Afzal's won the first match.

110
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:06,337
Mum has lost by ten wickets!

111
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:08,267
Ten wickets!

112
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,697
Wickets or lines,

113
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:10,817
One or the same.

114
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,587
His ten lines, to Mum,

115
00:06:12,587 --> 00:06:14,267
Are like ten wickets lost.

116
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,330
He bowled Mum out on every line of hers!

117
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,427
No need to get so excited.

118
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:20,957
Dad will decide to call Mehtab

119
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:23,787
Only after he meets Dad.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,657
Why didn't he meet Dad, though?

121
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,337
We'd told him he'd be meeting Dad after meeting Mum.

122
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:29,379
The same

123
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,167
That I said in Irish!

124
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,877
Irish?

125
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:35,477
He's had Mum have a canary!

126
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:38,787
Then he'll be as vulnerable as a canary before Dad!

127
00:06:38,787 --> 00:06:40,319
I have nothing to fear now.

128
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,037
I trust him.

129
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,367
And I trust him too!

130
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,178
No problem.

131
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:49,477
Tomorrow, he'll be meeting Dad.

132
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:50,845
You'll see.

133
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,405
Tomorrow, Dad will call bleeding Mehtab and say,

134
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,445
'Scurry away, you whippersnapper'!

135
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:23,446
Tell me where you're coming from.

136
00:07:24,797 --> 00:07:26,541
Did you go on a date?

137
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,007
You're coming after meeting her, right?

138
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,452
Wearing a new suit, eh, you bugger?

139
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:36,440
Seems it's more than a 'meeting'.

140
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,720
Innit? Tell me.

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,000
I won't tell.

142
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,939
You guard the honour of those

143
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:47,079
Whom you love, mate.

144
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:50,269
This bugger's trying to dupe us!

145
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,119
Here.

146
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,410
Your clothes have been ironed.

147
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,659
Put this on and get going!

148
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,539
You're not our type anymore.

149
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,666
Thank you, Timmy.

150
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,378
Leave it be, Afzal.

151
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:06,567
I'm not Sajid

152
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,896
Who'd be ensnared in your sweet talk.

153
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,806
You only use friends for your own ends.

154
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,444
I love the three of you so much.

155
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,744
I don't use you for my ends.

156
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,050
I swear by her.

157
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,170
Take his word for it, mate.

158
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,650
He doesn't lie when he swears by her.

159
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,800
Innit?

160
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,096
Praise the Lord.

161
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:50,370
O God, the most excellent one! Have mercy.

162
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:54,196
May my greetings reach your ears too!

163
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,286
They have reached.

164
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,379
And upon you, peace.

165
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:01,836
Wash your hands and rinse your mouth; I'll be serving dinner.

166
00:09:01,836 --> 00:09:04,736
I'm a Molvi, Ruqaiyya Begum.

167
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:07,803
My hands and my mouth are always clean.

168
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:09,596
And

169
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,505
Where is your most excellent one [Afzal]?

170
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:20,493
Do you remember when I'd asked you to give him a humbler name

171
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,846
For you may have to pay for it otherwise?

172
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:24,853
Stay quiet, Molvi Sahab!

173
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,883
If names made any difference, you wouldn't be 'Subhanallah' ['God's perfected Creation'] either!

174
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:32,095
My father named me.

175
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:36,853
When I was born, he saw me and exclaimed, 'Subhanallah' [Praise the Lord]!

176
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,729
And my mother said,

177
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,490
'That's the perfect name'!

178
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,100
If

179
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,950
Mum were alive today,

180
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,760
She'd ask you,

181
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,083
'Who's the greater one [Afzal] -'

182
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,740
'The one named Afzal',

183
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,229
'Or my Subhanallah'?

184
00:09:56,582 --> 00:09:58,514
Who's that?

185
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,790
Your Subhanallah!

186
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:03,550
Oh...

187
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,840
God is the Greatest...

188
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:53,519
Peace, Dad.

189
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,560
And upon you, peace.

190
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,769
Peace, dear Mum.

191
00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,279
And upon you, peace. May you live long.

192
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,730
Where are you coming from

193
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,959
At 9.30 p.m.?

194
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,749
By the Lord, Molvi Sahab,

195
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,859
Let him catch his breath.

196
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,879
Yes, do catch your breath.

197
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,096
Take in a gulp of air,

198
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:15,226
And then tell me where you're coming from.

199
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:17,836
You -- didn't tell Dad?

200
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:20,398
I was about to when you came.

201
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,386
I was meeting the boss.

202
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:23,756
Took quite some time.

203
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,606
Alright.

204
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,962
I hope he's satisfied with you?

205
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,223
Yes.

206
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:35,073
He's begun to give a lot of attention to you.

207
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:36,193
Otherwise,

208
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,287
These

209
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,323
Mill owners

210
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,893
Don't usually talk to office clerks.

211
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,673
I mean,

212
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:50,363
He's seen your talent clearly.

213
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:51,513
Monseigneur is

214
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,843
Quite adept at

215
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,735
Seeing through people

216
00:11:55,735 --> 00:11:56,603
My dear,

217
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,573
Please don't listen to what your Dad is saying.

218
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,273
He was just recounting how, when he was born,

219
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:05,903
His father exclaimed on seeing him, 'Praise the Lord' [Subhanallah]!

220
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,841
Why are you so hesitant?

221
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,559
Give her a befitting reply!

222
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,099
I've been embarrassed because of what I've said,

223
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,249
What do I say now?

224
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,829
If, before me

225
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,309
Stood my wife,

226
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,389
I would've replied to her,

227
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,549
But Afzal's mother stands before me right now.

228
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,799
Forgive me, Madame.

229
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,869
I accidentally uttered 'clerk'.

230
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,830
Here, have this.

231
00:13:08,118 --> 00:13:10,098
Eat properly.

232
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:14,188
Or is it that you've decided to die without him?

233
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,164
What are you doing, Irsa?

234
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:38,214
I think -- I'm --

235
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,694
I'm having a nightmare.

236
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,725
I can see

237
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:47,764
That blighter coming here with a wedding procession.

238
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,905
No --

239
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,340
I won't be able to see this, Monseigneur!

240
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,609
What will we tell people?

241
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,360
What will we say when questioned by our own family?

242
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,629
I don't have any reply.

243
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,819
And I'm sure it's the same with you.

244
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,398
Or --

245
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,788
Or will you proudly say

246
00:14:09,788 --> 00:14:12,866
That your daughter has married the one she loves?

247
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,886
Neither seeing his status or family background,

248
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,276
Nor seeing where and how he'd keep her,

249
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:19,396
When he'll earn and what he'll be able to feed her --

250
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:21,466
We'll think, Irsa.

251
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,296
Let's talk about it later.
-What do you mean, talk later?

252
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,976
We'll have to agree to it now, Monseigneur!

253
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,536
It's just like I've seen in countless films and dramas!

254
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,836
When girls want to impose their desires,

255
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,506
This is how they quieten!

256
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:36,406
They eat slowly, and

257
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:38,696
And eat little.

258
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,676
There!

259
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:43,293
Look at her cohort!

260
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,886
She'll tell her now

261
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:46,696
That I was saying something against her

262
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,576
While her Dad was quiet.

263
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:51,366
Mum, I'm going because I've had my dinner...

264
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:52,586
Oh, please!

265
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,396
Even if she wanted this badge of unseemliness,

266
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:59,446
She could've drooled over someone who's not from the neighbourhood!
-Mind your tongue, Irsa. Please.

267
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,330
Go, my dear.

268
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:16,516
That's not how you talk to daughters, Irsa.

269
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:19,096
Granted, she's made a mistake

270
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,666
She doesn't eat enough, stays quiet...

271
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,366
Perhaps she, too, thinks,

272
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,926
'What am I doing'?

273
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,379
Give her some time.

274
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,886
Don't start insulting her.

275
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:49,236
Afzal?

276
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:55,106
Dad's calling you for dinner.

277
00:16:04,324 --> 00:16:05,689
Afzal?

278
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Are you sleeping or just pretending to?

279
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,449
Afzal!

280
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,084
Afzal!

281
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,879
Mum! Dad!

282
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,239
Afzal's got a scorching fever!

283
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,409
Oh God...

284
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:41,543
Go right now

285
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,837
And tell Mum you were lying.

286
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,585
And tell her that I was in on it too!

287
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:48,932
Tell her that you don't love Afzal,

288
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:51,323
And nor does he love you!

289
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:56,182
Just -- We'd hired him to 'love',

290
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,243
But don't tell her about the money.

291
00:16:58,243 --> 00:16:59,653
Or else, she'd say,

292
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,492
'200,000 a month'

293
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:04,023
'To a third division BA'?

294
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:05,653
Have a glass of water,

295
00:17:05,653 --> 00:17:06,903
Ease yourself,

296
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,263
And then we'll talk.

297
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:10,322
To the dickens with easing!

298
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:12,326
Mum was hurling such insults

299
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:14,262
That would embarrass even sworn enemies!

300
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,633
And save this glass of water for yourself

301
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:19,132
For you'll be needing it in a while!

302
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:20,213
Tell me,

303
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,183
What did Mum say?

304
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:27,895
Fear God, Farah!

305
00:17:27,895 --> 00:17:30,102
You'd die when you hear it!

306
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,645
Alright, I'll die.

307
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:34,105
But please tell me the whole thing first!

308
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:36,456
You'll shriek so loud...

309
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:37,467
Let me shriek!

310
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,166
Don't worry.

311
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,831
Okay.

312
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,489
Shall we sit?

313
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,349
Why sit?

314
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:48,049
For the love of God, just sit!

315
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:51,000
You may plummet when you hear it!

316
00:18:05,226 --> 00:18:07,176
Peace be upon you.

317
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,380
And upon you, peace.

318
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,951
What happened, Monseigneur?

319
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,881
I've got a feeling

320
00:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,200
My blood pressure's high.

321
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,966
I'll check right away.

322
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,270
Sorry, but

323
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,030
It took me a while.

324
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,470
Molvi Sahab showed up

325
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,860
As I stepped out.

326
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,890
Who?

327
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,140
Molvi Subhanallah?

328
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,201
Yes.

329
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:34,324
His son's got a 103 fever.

330
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,260
And he was even afraid to tell that he'd gotten drenched in the rain!

331
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,737
These lads these days!

332
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,350
Alright, please don't speak now.

333
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,696
In the name of God.

334
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:08,636
Peace be upon you.

335
00:19:08,636 --> 00:19:11,296
And upon you, peace.

336
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,880
O Lord, the healer of all illnesses...

337
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:19,788
What's his temperature?
-103.

338
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:23,327
103?
-It's two degrees lower now.

339
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,560
Don't worry.

340
00:19:26,438 --> 00:19:32,216
The doctor didn't let him come home until the temperature started falling.

341
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,566
And

342
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:37,686
The doctor's advised him to have some tea with rusks.

343
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,066
So,

344
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,776
Get some tea,
-Yes, go.

345
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,367
I'll get some rusks.
-I'll go, Dad.

346
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,743
Sit down.
-No, my son.

347
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,288
Sit down and relax.

348
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,616
Get some rest.

349
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:51,796
And tell your mother

350
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:55,543
Where you got drenched in the rain!

351
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,096
Where did you get drenched?

352
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:06,466
Your clothes were all dry.

353
00:20:06,547 --> 00:20:08,356
That -- I -- The doctor

354
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,697
Was asking many questions.

355
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:13,053
'What did you eat, drink; how did you get this fever',

356
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:16,482
So I just said that I got drenched in the rain.

357
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,683
You lied to the doctor?

358
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,403
I didn't lie, Mum.

359
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:21,964
I did get a bit wet...

360
00:20:22,343 --> 00:20:24,533
It was quite the downpour!

361
00:20:24,729 --> 00:20:26,585
But you were inside your office.

362
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:29,321
No, Mum, I'm not inside the office at all times.

363
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:30,947
There's no roof overhead

364
00:20:30,947 --> 00:20:34,304
When you go from Accounts to Production.

365
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:36,529
Besides,

366
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:39,419
What's the worst that can happen if you get drenched in the season's rains?

367
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:40,829
You can have a fever!

368
00:20:40,829 --> 00:20:43,010
103!

369
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,389
You --

370
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:48,839
Get me some tea.

371
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,630
I'm hungry.

372
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,709
Go!

373
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,316
It would've been better if you'd bought a thermometer too.

374
00:20:57,316 --> 00:20:59,196
I'll keep on having doubts

375
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,010
When the wretched fever will wear off...

376
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,166
It'll wear off as soon as I've had some of Arifa's tea.

377
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,786
Lie down.

378
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,596
Just for a while. Here.

379
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:09,957
Wait while she gets you some tea.

380
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,663
Would you tell me what happened?

381
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:22,283
It may have hurt you,

382
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:25,164
But at least it didn't hurt our reputation.

383
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:27,913
I don't have the slightest sorrow.

384
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,224
If Mum started talking like this,

385
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,314
You won't find a place to bury your head with shame.

386
00:21:36,314 --> 00:21:38,834
She said it before Dad...

387
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:41,116
God forgive...

388
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:44,565
Alright,

389
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:47,191
I accept it's our fault,

390
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:51,224
But we should be granted at least a shred of clemency.

391
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:59,406
Please, go on.

392
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,928
She must've been delighted to hear it.

393
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,990
I didn't talk to her.

394
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:09,058
Hey!

395
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:11,347
You'd marched from here as if

396
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,412
You'd create quite the racket there.

397
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,023
What happened?

398
00:22:15,197 --> 00:22:17,127
Dad's unwell.

399
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,102
His blood pressure's shot up!

400
00:22:19,102 --> 00:22:21,317
The doctor just left after examining him.

401
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:22,977
I turned back the moment I heard it...

402
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:26,017
Imagine what would happen if Dad heard it.

403
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:30,474
Don't worry.

404
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,936
I'll tell her in the morning --
-Don't wait until the morning.

405
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,918
Tell me whatever you want to right now.

406
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,487
Mum...

407
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:48,376
I was furious at that blighter,

408
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:51,786
And I vented all my anger on you.

409
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,426
I've heard it somewhere

410
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,376
That a mother's insult is not an insult.

411
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,786
If you still think

412
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:01,036
That I insulted you, please forgive me.

413
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,646
What's this you're saying?

414
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,566
It's far more insulting

415
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:07,736
That you're asking forgiveness of me.

416
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,400
Get me through to him.

417
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,479
Whom?

418
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:17,190
That blighter, obviously!

419
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,431
I'd deliberately had him stand

420
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:22,150
In the rain.

421
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,021
I thought he'd look dishevelled

422
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,231
Drenched like that.

423
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:28,179
But I never thought

424
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:30,929
He could get a 103 fever.

425
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:33,272
He's gotten a 103 fever?

426
00:23:33,272 --> 00:23:35,020
As if you don't know!

427
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,080
I swear I don't.

428
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,830
Would you look at that?

429
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,090
He's trounced me again!

430
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,310
He didn't even complain to you about how I treated him!

431
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,502
This is Molvi Subhanallah's upbringing!

432
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:49,680
The poor lad's a 3rd division BA,

433
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,220
But a 1st division in the elegance of his manners.

434
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,121
When you ask about his health,

435
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:00,521
Please do ask him to come and meet your father when he's well.

436
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,113
Good morning!

437
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:48,360
It's 'Peace be upon you', not 'Good morning'!

438
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,880
Well, peace be upon you, but where are you off to?

439
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,380
You didn't wake me up? It's 8 already!

440
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,961
Where do you have to go?

441
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,930
Good question, where do I go everyday?

442
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,490
Take a leave, then.

443
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,631
Tell them you got drenched going to the Production wing from Accounts

444
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:04,480
And got a fever. Ask them to grant you a day's leave.

445
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,240
And if you think the mill will close down if you don't go,

446
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,710
You may go right now.

447
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,041
I've ironed another pair of trousers and shirt and kept them in the cupboard.

448
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,350
I'm thinking, too, that I'd rather not go...

449
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,210
A 103 fever's no trifle.

450
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,590
What could I do now?

451
00:25:22,961 --> 00:25:24,662
Great.

452
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,532
Why 'great'?

453
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,661
I'm happy to hear your decision.

454
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,972
It has saved you a pointless perplexity.

455
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,221
What kind of perplexity?

456
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,205
A job's a job after all!

457
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:36,461
Please, go now.

458
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:39,391
I'll get you breakfast in a few minutes.

459
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,050
This is also the first time you've said 'Please, go now'!

460
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:48,069
It didn't exactly please me.

461
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,026
Don't you intend to go to the University?

462
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,297
Is it morning already?

463
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,920
What?

464
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,776
The sun's come up...

465
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,280
So you've been awake all night?

466
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,620
No...

467
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:56,839
I'm growing dozy now...

468
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,979
Mind if I doze off?

469
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,909
Not at all...

470
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,460
Could've at least called him.

471
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:22,179
Mum would never forgive herself if he died...

472
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:26,129
Why don't you call him?

473
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,260
He'll talk to you if he's alive.

474
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,083
He'll stay quiet if I call him,

475
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,093
And I'll think

476
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,159
He's no more.

477
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,361
Where are you? I've brought breakfast.

478
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:59,281
I'm in the bathroom. Brushing.

479
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:02,226
I'll keep it on the table.

480
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:07,206
Alright; keep my medicine on the table too.

481
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:10,096
Where's your medicine?

482
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,536
Right under the pillow.

483
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,327
Hello.

484
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,836
I've heard you've gotten a 103 fever?

485
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,053
I've gotten you all drenched in the rain, haven't I?

486
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:50,437
I'm so sorry...

487
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:12,376
You're taking the medicine along!

488
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,536
I thought

489
00:29:16,536 --> 00:29:18,437
I'd take it.

490
00:29:18,736 --> 00:29:21,366
Such a medicine will be invented some day, won't it,

491
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,506
That the sister takes,

492
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:25,696
And the brother gets cured,

493
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:28,045
Completely cured?

494
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:31,764
Alright. Have your breakfast, take your medicine.

495
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:34,204
Forget your job and get some rest.

496
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:35,794
In fact,

497
00:29:35,794 --> 00:29:37,264
Give me your office phone number.

498
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:40,824
I'll call and tell them that Afzal's unwell and won't be coming today.

499
00:29:40,824 --> 00:29:42,904
No -- Not at all.

500
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:44,734
I'll call.

501
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,734
I'll tell them.

502
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:49,034
Don't worry.

503
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,171
The two of you didn't go to the University today?

504
00:30:55,171 --> 00:30:56,490
How could I go alone?

505
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,570
She's lying flat out in the arms of Morpheus.

506
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,860
She's been awake all night.

507
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,269
Because of me.

508
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:07,109
In fact, because of you.

509
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:12,199
Even if I'd said something, why did you have to tell her?

510
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:14,159
When did she fall asleep?

511
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,629
Just some 15 minutes ago.

512
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,029
How's Afzal now?

513
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,600
How do I know?

514
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,419
You could've called and asked!

515
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:27,079
Whatever he's like, he's sick.

516
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:29,750
Because of me.

517
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,919
Why have you started blaming yourself?

518
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,209
I asked the poor lad twice to have some tea.

519
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:38,869
But I don't know what had gotten into him; he said, 'I won't'.

520
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:41,100
Or perhaps

521
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,570
It was just something I'd said...

522
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,098
By the way,

523
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:48,530
To be quite honest

524
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,490
Yes?

525
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,270
He doesn't know how to show anger.

526
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,610
He shows the same old expression all the time.

527
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:55,669
I don't think he watches any films or dramas.

528
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:56,420
Actually,

529
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,969
I think he must be into films.

530
00:31:57,969 --> 00:31:59,949
So what if he's a Molvi's son?

531
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:02,259
After all, he's a lad from the neighbourhood!

532
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,409
Do you know,

533
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:06,480
The rapscallion smiled even as I said things

534
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,289
That would make one's face redden with rage!

535
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,509
Hello?

536
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:28,320
Right.

537
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:30,311
Afzal speaking.

538
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,364
I know.

539
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:33,590
Has your fever worn off?

540
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,219
It has.

541
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:38,020
But who told you?

542
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,490
We keep tabs on our office staff.

543
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,740
Hey!

544
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,020
Farah is very satisfied with you!

545
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,095
Oh?

546
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,950
What a performance!

547
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,280
It felt like a scene from 'Romeo and Juliet'!

548
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:56,950
Which scene?

549
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,140
Oh?

550
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,810
So you do watch films after all!

551
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,141
You would remember that balcony scene.

552
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:05,061
What perfect lines by Juliet!

553
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Did I say it like that?

554
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,720
That had been said rather rebelliously,

555
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,621
You said it all with a smile!

556
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:12,481
But --

557
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,700
She --

558
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:16,631
Does she think I said it well enough too?

559
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:18,631
She's raving mad about you!

560
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:23,392
She was saying before the meeting, 'Our punter will surely win this round'!

561
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,441
Punter?

562
00:33:25,441 --> 00:33:27,131
She didn't exactly say 'punter',

563
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:29,491
That's just something I uttered...

564
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:33,442
When do I meet Monseigneur?

565
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,003
Get better first.

566
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:36,972
Let the fever wear off for good

567
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:39,142
And then we'll fix a date for that.

568
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,753
No, please do fix a date.

569
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:44,172
The fever's worn off.

570
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:47,022
Don't worry.

571
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,595
I'll win again.

572
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,567
You're real clever, you punter!

573
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:56,366
You want to finish 4 months of work in 4 days and take your 800,000?

574
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:57,506
No!

575
00:33:57,506 --> 00:34:00,587
If I did that, I'd be charged with a grave sin!

576
00:34:00,587 --> 00:34:02,585
When we'd negotiated it for four months,

577
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,196
My four months are hers.

578
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:07,399
Besides,

579
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:11,066
I needed a job.

580
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,706
My family's delighted too.

581
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,848
I've started down the path of righteousness.

582
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:17,758
Alright.

583
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:21,068
We'll fix a meeting for tomorrow when she wakes up.

584
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,189
She's sleeping?

585
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,211
She's just fallen asleep.

586
00:34:26,211 --> 00:34:28,540
Got furious last night over something,

587
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,919
And stayed awake in her anger all night.

588
00:34:31,627 --> 00:34:32,917
Oh...

589
00:34:32,917 --> 00:34:35,197
Mind if I ask you something?

590
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:36,977
Please, ask away.

591
00:34:37,348 --> 00:34:40,888
What you say doesn't quite match your reputation.

592
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,048
Tell me,

593
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:45,008
Are you like this, or have you just become like this?

594
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,849
Good question.

595
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:52,349
Alright. I got it.

596
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:53,409
I'll disconnect.

597
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,161
I'll call in the evening when I've talked to Farah. Bye.

598
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,675
Bye.

599
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,850
Shall I take the dishes if you've had your breakfast?

600
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,340
Yes, I have. Take them away.

601
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,900
Would you look at this phone?

602
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:15,086
It's new.

603
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,148
It cost 40,000.

604
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,811
Where'd you get 40,000?

605
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:21,588
Where would I get it from?

606
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:24,317
The office fellows bought me this.

607
00:35:24,317 --> 00:35:25,567
Wow...

608
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,708
A phone worth 40,000 for a clerk?

609
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:31,148
You've hit a jackpot!

610
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:32,928
Jackpot?

611
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:35,107
What's this you're saying?

612
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:37,938
That is what one would say to your type.

613
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:41,439
You're green with envy...

614
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,029
Don't show it to Dad.

615
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:46,219
If he gets envious,

616
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:49,299
It'd paint the world green.

617
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,759
Ruqaiyya!

618
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:00,289
Pray tell, sire.

619
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,656
Praise the Lord [Subhanallah]!

620
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,522
You're talking with such respect!

621
00:36:06,522 --> 00:36:09,098
I respect you so much.

622
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:10,566
I have to.

623
00:36:10,566 --> 00:36:12,576
It's an old order to me.

624
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,569
Pray tell. What is it?

625
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:19,936
The two of you are all so occupied looking after Afzal today

626
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,876
That nobody served me breakfast!

627
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:23,996
Sit down.

628
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:25,750
I'll serve you breakfast.

629
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:27,987
Thank you so much!

630
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:29,686
Otherwise

631
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,516
I was beginning to think

632
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:34,326
I'd have to get drenched in the rain

633
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,826
Get a 103 fever

634
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,807
To earn such respect!

635
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:42,248
They say you should say something nice

636
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:44,216
Even if you don't look so good.

637
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:47,486
You're saying this a bit browned off...

638
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:50,380
Otherwise

639
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:56,238
You used to say before Mr Afzal came of age,

640
00:36:56,238 --> 00:36:59,740
'There is no other'

641
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,168
'Like you, Molvi Sahab'.

642
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,668
I say it to this day.

643
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:07,528
By the grace of God, there is none like you.

644
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:12,950
But try to understand what that means.

645
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,430
May I go and meet some of my friends?

646
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,099
Are you asking me?

647
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,089
Yes.

648
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,759
No!

649
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:29,869
Ask your mother about

650
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:33,620
Such ill-fated zeal!

651
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:39,809
So, Ruqaiyya Begum, please tell him if he may go and visit his friends.

652
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,389
Go, my dear.

653
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:43,289
But come back quickly.

654
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:44,789
There!

655
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:47,829
That's how you should be asking!

656
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:50,920
Go; it's a great day to be you!

657
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,050
But please tell me before you leave

658
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,909
If you've taken your medicine.

659
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,550
I have.

660
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,177
Then, I'd request you

661
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:05,661
To come home before it's time for your next dose.

662
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:07,411
Yes.

663
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:09,320
God be with ye.

664
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:17,136
Alright now, get me some breakfast.

665
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,040
God is the Greatest...

666
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,280
92,

667
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,702
93,

668
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:33,701
94,

669
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:35,111
95,

670
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,850
96,

671
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,421

674
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:51,841
