1
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:13,570
<i>Who were those people</i>

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,788
<i>Who won their love?</i>

3
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:23,855
<i>When obsecrating for rosebuds</i>

4
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:30,274
<i>I was presented with a garland of thorns...</i>

5
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:35,842
<i>Who were those people</i>

6
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:40,572
<i>Who won their love?</i>

7
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,436
Peace be upon you, Mum.

8
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,712
What happened to her?

9
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,680
Why was she so furious?

10
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,606
She's coming after insulting him!

11
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,305
Whom?

12
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,958
The same Afzal.

13
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,702
Came across him a few times,

14
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,465
And it got into her head.

15
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,505
She's said such things

16
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:56,462
As only God can forgive her for!

17
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,301
Listen.

18
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:24,240
I did what was right, didn't I?

19
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,916
In a way, you did.

20
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,200
But you did it too early.

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,480
If I didn't do it early,

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,603
The blighter would've besmirched my name in the entire neighbourhood!

23
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,511
Those who can listen to abuses quietly

24
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,753
Never besmirch others' names.

25
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,512
You've besmirched his name,

26
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,310
And along with him, you've besmirched your own name.

27
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:48,025
It occurred to me last night that I should call Arifa and ask her to tell him

28
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:51,305
Not to show himself before Farah.

29
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,684
But you...

30
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,482
Well,

31
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,480
What's done is done.

32
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:15,909
You bugger!

33
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,092
That'd be your fourth cigarette!

34
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:20,592
You've been telling me for two years

35
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:23,961
And now you'd die out of grief over a girl?

36
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:27,182
I'm in dire straits, Sajid.

37
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,118
I was in dire straits too.

38
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:32,467
Back then, you used to pull my leg.

39
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,870
Hyderabad can no longer nurture my life

40
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:42,545
But my Mum won't let me leave.

41
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,625
Where would you go?

42
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,448
Karachi.

43
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:50,230
To whom?

44
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,560
To Karachiites.

45
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,715
And what's your reason for going?

46
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:02,326
My conscience asks me to go.

47
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,961
Then why are you asking your Mum?

48
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,747
Go.

49
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:08,701
I will, Sajid.

50
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:12,248
If only somebody told me

51
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:16,390
Which of my mother and my conscience is the greater.

52
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:38,527
Why don't you tell him?

53
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,426
The mother is always the greater one!

54
00:04:41,597 --> 00:04:45,439
He'd only take his mother's word on that.

55
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:04,408
If she's the one who wrote those letters, who was the one who meted out such humiliation that night?

56
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:07,340
That's what I can't quite understand.

57
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,079
I'm thinking of meeting her one of these days

58
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,252
And asking her what the true story is.

59
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:17,124
Perhaps the two of them have had some differences.

60
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:19,857
Or perhaps it's that she does not love him anymore?

61
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:23,750
Why, then, was she talking about 800,000 and some deal?

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,473
She said she'd hired him for 200,000 a month

63
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:29,114
To 'love' her for four months.

64
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,317
That part about four months is a white lie.

65
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,895
She's been writing him letters for years!

66
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:35,170
Since the days she must be doing her GCSEs!

67
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,493
Ah, the pastimes of opulent demoiselles!

68
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,124
A letter to one,

69
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:41,686
A call to another...

70
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,383
She's not the type!

71
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,860
She's an honest type of girl!

72
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,404
A bit apprehensive and skittish,

73
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:51,328
One who saves herself from the evil gaze.

74
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:54,063
She's neither snappish, nor conceited.

75
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,859
If you sit with her, it feels like you're with an old friend.

76
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,170
She'd seize your hand and stop you as you're leaving.

77
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,298
I'd only seen her love,

78
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:07,957
This is the first time I've seen her despise someone.

79
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:14,196
Lubna's calling.

80
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,352
Hello?

81
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,410
Lubna speaking.

82
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,188
I know.

83
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,334
What were you doing?

84
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:31,992
I was sitting with Mum.

85
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,212
She's stitching me a shirt.

86
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,024
Where are you now?

87
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,508
In my room.

88
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:38,989
And where's your brother?

89
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:40,348
He's not at home.

90
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,775
Have you ever asked him where he goes?

91
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,025
No.

92
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:46,628
Nobody asks him such questions.

93
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:47,870
Oh...

94
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,939
So you've given him free rein.

95
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,942
Lubna,

96
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:54,492
I know my brother just as well as you know your sister.

97
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:56,629
I've never called to say to you,

98
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:59,010
'So you've given Farah free rein'.

99
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,986
Arifa,

100
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,473
You're getting angry because you don't know the truth.

101
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:05,238
And you're saying all of this because you don't know the truth either.

102
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:08,038
I called to tell you something, mate.

103
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:11,270
It seems you were just itching to pick a quarrel!

104
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,455
Go on.

105
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:15,429
He stands in our way as we go to the University in the morning

106
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:16,645
As he does

107
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,770
When we're coming back.

108
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,612
So what?

109
00:07:19,612 --> 00:07:20,360
What 'so'?

110
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,599
This isn't something good.

111
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,300
Many more boys can be found standing on roads and in alleyways.

112
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,269
I suppose you call to tell their sisters too?

113
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,317
Please, Arifa,

114
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,858
Farah is getting mad with rage over it.

115
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,412
Tell her to buy the entire neighbourhood if she can!

116
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,662
Watch how you're talking!

117
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,457
I will talk like this, Lubna, if you talk about my brother this way.

118
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:40,161
Do you know what happened today?

119
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,219
Something's happened?

120
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,576
He was standing in our way,

121
00:07:42,576 --> 00:07:43,577
And Farah saw him.

122
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:47,327
Stopped the car, got out, and humiliated him before everyone!

123
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,886
Are you listening?

124
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,812
I've just called to tell you

125
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,121
To stop him.

126
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,576
Next time, she'd slap him on his face!

127
00:07:54,576 --> 00:07:57,321
Then tell Farah to be afraid!

128
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,197
I'm going to break her face!

129
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:01,076
Are you listening?

130
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,661
You might as well hear this:

131
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:05,773
If my brother's quietly taken all that insult,

132
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,548
Tell Farah she'll get a befitting reply to it.

133
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:09,595
I will talk to her

134
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,555
On that very street and alleyway!

135
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:12,762
Are you mad?

136
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,327
Are you touched in the head?

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,530
Give the phone to her!

138
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,361
I want to talk to the blighter!

139
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,572
Let me see her snobbery over her father's riches!

140
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:22,306
Give the phone to her, will you?

141
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:25,713
Tell the peeress to try something like this again if she's got the courage!

142
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,910
Leave a slap,

143
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,219
I dare her to talk to Afzal with so much as her voice raised!

144
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,967
I swear by my father, I'd rip her apart!

145
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,279
He'll be standing right there in the morning,

146
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,609
Tell her to stop the car,

147
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,824
And come out!

148
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,315
I swear by God,

149
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:43,065
I'm not Molvi Subhanallah's daughter if I did not cut her down to her puny size!

150
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,302
Peace be upon you.

151
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,955
And upon you.

152
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,610
She was alright just now...

153
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,340
Her friend called her, and

154
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,838
She dashed upstairs.

155
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,838
'Her friend called her'!

156
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:39,199
Put it plainly that Lubna called her.

157
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,859
She will only give such expressions when she'd call her.

158
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,345
Mum!

159
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:47,999
I'm going over to Lubna's!

160
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,107
She's taken to you.

161
00:09:55,107 --> 00:10:01,804
One can't tell whether you're just letting me know or asking for permission when you leave for somewhere!

162
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:46,129
Don't ask for your 98,000 now.

163
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,603
I've quit gambling.

164
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,900
I'm a bit skint these days.

165
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:53,134
Talk to the old colony lads.

166
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:56,249
We're playing a match tonight.

167
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:02,255
You must be itching to play some cricket, innit?

168
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:03,883
No.

169
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,989
I've got an itch to gamble.

170
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,460
Put a sock in it!

171
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,003
You don't believe me, do you?

172
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,277
You think like my Dad that I've corrected my ways?

173
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:20,493
I've not corrected my ways, mate.

174
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:23,027
I'm my same old self.

175
00:11:23,027 --> 00:11:25,211
A gambler.

176
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,661
I swore an oath,

177
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:29,766
Made promises,

178
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:31,656
But kept on playing.

179
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:34,660
The thing is, I've badly lost a big gamble.

180
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,114
I have not a penny

181
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,720
In my heart, mind, or pocket.

182
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,069
I've lost everything, mate.

183
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,398
Just talk to the old colony lads.

184
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:48,801
Tell them we're playing for 100,000.

185
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,001
We're playing the match today, Babloo.

186
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,773
I don't have any money.

187
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,110
And what if you lost?

188
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,125
Put a sock in it!

189
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,253
I lost to someone else.

190
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:04,535
I never played to win there in the first place.

191
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:07,793
Alright, talk to them and tell me over the phone.

192
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,293
I'll give the buggers a right beating!

193
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,428
Call her!

194
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:32,801
Get me through to her!

195
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,136
Let me see, too, how she talks!

196
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,052
Splendid,

197
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,305
Instead of being ashamed of what her brother did

198
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,074
And asking forgiveness of me,

199
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:42,429
She's showing me such arrogance!

200
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,553
I'm saying call her!

201
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,385
To the dickens with her!

202
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:49,574
To the dickens with you, too!

203
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:56,296
If you know how to create a scene on the road,

204
00:12:56,296 --> 00:13:00,625
I know how to barge in and take on the likes of you!

205
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,511
What's this, Arifa?

206
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:04,292
Sit down and talk calmly.

207
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,871
Sit down my foot!

208
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:11,938
I consider it my insult to set foot in the house of the haughty!

209
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:16,400
It was her depravity that compelled me to come here to give a befitting reply,

210
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,188
Else, I would not even spit at your doorstep!

211
00:13:20,188 --> 00:13:21,880
Look, you're being insolent there!

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,087
If I uttered something,

213
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:24,134
It'd inflame you!

214
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,357
Shut up, Farah.

215
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:27,729
She's come to our home.

216
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,620
Is there anything left for you to inflame?

217
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,533
Or do you think that you can don this knavish veil and be hailed as virtuous?

218
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:37,882
You're not virtuous.

219
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,329
Behind your innocent face, you conceal the disgustful truth of your character!

220
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,532
Your family may be nescient but I'm not.

221
00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:48,487
I know everything,

222
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,122
As does he

223
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:54,539
Whom you've humiliated in broad daylight.

224
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:59,882
He listened to every bit of your bosh quietly because he's Molvi Subhanallah's son.

225
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,933
Don't take this for his poltroonery;

226
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,524
Such is his upbringing,

227
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,274
Farah Ibrahim.

228
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:12,272
Whether a woman is one like yourself or like one

229
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:14,218
Miss Rosy from your office,

230
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:18,841
He's been taught to respect her at any cost.

231
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:19,866
Look, Arifa,

232
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:21,278
This is not proper.

233
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,804
If she's made a mistake,

234
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:24,408
Talk to her calmly.

235
00:14:24,408 --> 00:14:27,986
Too much has been said already for me to talk calmly now.

236
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:31,240
The only thing left, now, is a confrontation.

237
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,868
I'll meet you in the same alleyway tomorrow morning.

238
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,118
My brother will be with me.

239
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:39,938
Get out of your car and walk up to him if you dare,

240
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:43,437
And if I fail to make your disgustful reality show up on your face,

241
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,873
I'd change my name!

242
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,081
That's enough, Arifa.

243
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:50,403
If you cannot talk calmly, you may show yourself out.

244
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,513
I'm leaving, my dear.

245
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:55,487
Let me just show her

246
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,942
Her true face in the mirror as I leave.

247
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,177
Here

248
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:08,371
Are four letters for you to read.

249
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:14,647
There are over a hundred in my brother's cupboard.

250
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,628
Reading these would

251
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,940
Tear the curtain of her virtuousness that's been pulled over your eyes.

252
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:28,860
She is the one

253
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,610
Who used to write letters to my brother.

254
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,859
Sorry, Aunt,

255
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,090
But I had no other option.

256
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:56,717
Do you have these memorised by heart or do I need to read them out?

257
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,670
Farah!

258
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:13,406
May the Lord reward you [for this favour].

259
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,443
Peace be upon you.

260
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:23,420
Hey!

261
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,735
You're back already?

262
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,066
Didn't she serve you tea or something?

263
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:31,290
I needed just so much time to do what I had to.

264
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,686
And you know just as well

265
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,068
That theirs is not a place where we can have tea.

266
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,367
I'm going to offer my afternoon prayers.

267
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,385
What did you have to do?

268
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:47,937
There is still time for the afternoon prayer.

269
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:55,843
Would you say something only when your Dad asks or would you give me the honour?

270
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,269
Farah had misbehaved with him.

271
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,006
I'd gone to give her a befitting reply.

272
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,200
Why did she misbehave?

273
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:38,927
She thought Afzal stands in her way as she goes to and comes back from the University.

274
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:41,647
Is there any bit of truth in this?

275
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,595
Well, he's surely been going somewhere for the last two days...

276
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:48,250
There are bits of truth in a lot more, Mum.

277
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,670
She'd concealed some, and we'd concealed others.

278
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,205
Everything has come out in the open today.

279
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:54,768
What have you done?

280
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,476
Shoved her letters in her face

281
00:18:56,476 --> 00:19:00,634
And said that I'd have her answer for this latest insult.

282
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,385
What a silly girl!

283
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:06,552
She lives in a glass house and throws stones at lovers.

284
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,393
Get it straight, Mademoiselle,

285
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:10,690
Even if Afzal loves you,

286
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,868
We are not bound by his love.

287
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:17,440
Our intentions may change any minute.

288
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:33,458
Look, Afzal,

289
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,946
I've talked about the match,

290
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:37,117
But I've only got 1,500 Rupees.

291
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,352
That's enough.

292
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:40,392
Keep it safe in your pocket.

293
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:42,848
What about the remaining 98,500?

294
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,005
What for?

295
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:44,898
You bugger!

296
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:47,242
We'd have to give 100,000 in cash if we lost the match!

297
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,782
Spit in my face if I lose.

298
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:51,126
I've told you,

299
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,158
There's no chance of losing, Babloo.

300
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,014
Hey!

301
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,363
Watch those big words.

302
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,203
Remember,

303
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:58,297
It takes just one ball to get bowled.

304
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,214
Be positive, mate.

305
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:04,692
Think how long it takes to not get bowled.

306
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,008
Tell me the time.

307
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,672
8 p.m. sharp.

308
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,832
Get ready.

309
00:20:12,832 --> 00:20:15,204
I'll be there at 8.

310
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:49,565
That was all it was.

311
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,430
Lie down, dear.

312
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,397
Come with me.

313
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,501
Where's she going?

314
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,730
She's fine, doctor.

315
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:05,687
She had to go somewhere.

316
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,145
She's late.

317
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,247
As you wish, but she's not completely fine right now.

318
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:14,694
She will be in a while.

319
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,080
Come, doctor.

320
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,179
Where to?

321
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,652
Tell him where to.

322
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:30,897
Where to?

323
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:32,817
Why, Arifa's!

324
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,879
Turn right.

325
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,949
Where's she gone?

326
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:00,119
To Afzal's.

327
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:01,707
Why?

328
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:06,009
She came across him on her way and insulted him.

329
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:10,402
Arifa came here and put her right in her senses when she found out.

330
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,400
She must've gone

331
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,615
To apologise.

332
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,115
Who's Arifa?

333
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,343
Afzal's sister.

334
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:18,353
She'll have to admit it one day, Irsa,

335
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:21,005
That he's very virtuous.

336
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:24,264
My impression can never be off.

337
00:22:53,434 --> 00:23:01,434
God is the Greatest...

338
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:48,092
Rush to your success...

339
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:56,183
God is the Greatest...

340
00:23:56,624 --> 00:24:05,561
For there is none but Him.

341
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,560
Sit.

342
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,628
Don't worry.

343
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:32,339
There's nobody here except the two of us.

344
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,130
Would you like some tea or coffee?

345
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,849
We also have coffee at our place.

346
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:41,683
No, thank you.

347
00:24:41,683 --> 00:24:43,702
Do you want to check the cups and dishes?

348
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:44,543
They're clean.

349
00:24:44,543 --> 00:24:45,728
They've been washed.

350
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:46,800
Please, Arifa, sit.

351
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,066
I want to talk to you.

352
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:50,671
You will not say one word against my brother.

353
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:51,531
I will neither listen

354
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,700
Nor let you speak.

355
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,810
I will forget that you've come to our house.

356
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,126
I promise

357
00:24:57,126 --> 00:25:00,409
I won't say a word against your brother.

358
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,659
I've just come to explain my side of the story

359
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,661
And I hope you'd believe everything I have to say.

360
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,020
I can't guarantee that.

361
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:15,957
Alright.

362
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:18,842
I have a way out.

363
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:21,959
Get the Qur'an and keep it here.

364
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,561
I'm ritually pure

365
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,978
And have come to swear on oath.

366
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:27,621
If you don't believe my purity,

367
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:29,942
I can purify myself before you.

368
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:31,188
Alright.

369
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:32,971
Go on.

370
00:25:33,336 --> 00:25:34,230
No.

371
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,475
Bring the Qur'an.

372
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:38,963
I will say everything as an oath on the Qur'an.

373
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:43,833
No, my dear.

374
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,385
Go on.

375
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:49,215
I trust everything you have to say.

376
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,894
I solemnly swear with the Lord as my witness

377
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:22,144
That I've never written any letter to Afzal.

378
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:30,033
All these letters are false.

379
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,542
Or the Farah in these letters

380
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:34,129
Is someone else...

381
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,280
I've only seen Afzal

382
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,917
About three or four times on my way in my lifetime.

383
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:41,946
Or heard from the maid or Lubna

384
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:45,196
That Afzal is Arifa's brother.

385
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:47,075
I met him for the first time in my life

386
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:49,737
In her presence at the restaurant,

387
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,621
Where we decided he'd --

388
00:26:51,621 --> 00:26:53,821
Feign love for me for four months,

389
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,605
For which I'd pay him 800,000 Rupees.

390
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:57,428
I mean

391
00:26:57,428 --> 00:26:59,631
200,000 a month.

392
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,616
This, too, happened because of her

393
00:27:01,616 --> 00:27:03,786
Because she'd wanted to help him

394
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:06,532
As he had been ousted an innocent and was out of work.

395
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:10,071
She thought it'd earn him some.

396
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:11,602
And

397
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:13,480
If he's ever met me during this period,

398
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,752
Or paid a visit to meet Mum and Dad, it was all a part of his job.

399
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:21,066
I was able to get rid of the one

400
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:23,705
I was getting married off to,

401
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,118
But if Mum and Dad

402
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:27,201
Found Afzal suitable in these meetings,

403
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:28,844
What's my fault?

404
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:32,344
What do I have to do with their choice?

405
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:34,925
This is why we'd planned it with Afzal

406
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,620
That under any such circumstance,

407
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,039
He'd leave Hyderabad for a month or two.

408
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,776
But -- I don't know what suddenly got into him,

409
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:47,879
He brought you and Molvi Uncle over to my place to get engaged to me.

410
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:58,578
I believe your purity.

411
00:27:58,627 --> 00:28:04,300
Place your hand over the Honourable Qur'an and swear that everything you've said is true.

412
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,269
Hold it, Farah.

413
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,820
Wait.

414
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:13,109
Ask me

415
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:16,018
I can place my hand over the Qur'an and swear

416
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:19,782
That everything she's said is true.

417
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:44,110
Peace be upon you, Monsieur.

418
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,748
And upon you, peace.

419
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:46,937
Who's come?

420
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:49,896
Mesdemoiselles Farah and Lubna.

421
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:51,639
Right...

422
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:53,227
Everything alright?

423
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:55,242
Everything's fine.

424
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,940
Alright, my dear.

425
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,354
There, now!

426
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:04,691
Speak of the Devil!

427
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:07,852
God has willed for him such a long life!

428
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:09,664
Come here, my son.

429
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:13,380
We were missing and waiting for none but you.

430
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:17,499
Come here, my dear, why are you embarrassed?

431
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:21,937
Who's the outsider here, whose presence has you petrified?

432
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:25,219
There's good old Lubna,

433
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,455
And with her,

434
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,647
Sweet Farah.

435
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,159
She's come here to listen to all her letters!

436
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,659
You read them out with such evident pleasure!

437
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:38,784
And the poor lass cannot even remember what she's been writing to you all along!

438
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:42,305
She's not the one who used to write letters to me, Mum.

439
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,065
Why didn't you take us to her place then?

440
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,410
I will, one day.

441
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,360
I live in wait of that day.

442
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,790
Peace be upon you.

443
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,271
Peace be upon you.

444
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:09,881
And upon you, peace.

445
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,968
You've come

446
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:16,436
To pinch us again, haven't you?

447
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:18,491
And

448
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:19,759
What's with this

449
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,337
Walloping before the guests?

450
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:28,973
The blighter's knavery has been caught again!

451
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:36,330
He's been up to knavery before?

452
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,470
He used to rob me of my serenity,

453
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,510
But now, it's as if he's killed me!

454
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:47,653
We'll take our leave...

455
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:50,514
No, my dear, how can that be?

456
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:53,713
You've come here for the first time,

457
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:56,378
And seeing this empty table, it seems

458
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,470
Like you've had nothing at all!

459
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,017
Sit. Please, sit.

460
00:31:01,268 --> 00:31:05,937
Go, my dear, get some tea or coffee. Go.

461
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:11,331
And, Ruqaiyya Begum,

462
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:16,302
Robbing parents of their serenity and life is no robbery,

463
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:19,519
For both are a treasure in the possession of children,

464
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,252
That they can dig up and collect when they desire.

465
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,821
My good man,

466
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:31,823
Rob us of all our serenity if you want,

467
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:36,161
But please don't suck the life out of her just yet.

468
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:40,290
Your mother is very helpful to me.

469
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,879
Right,

470
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:44,671
Ruqaiyya Begum,

471
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:48,485
She's come to our house for the first time.

472
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:52,000
Do not let her leave empty-handed.

473
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:55,043
How's Dad, my dear?

474
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:57,531
He's fine.

475
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,368
And what are you doing, standing here like this?

476
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:02,982
Go and purify yourself.

477
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,967
Offer your night prayers

478
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:08,492
And beg forgiveness for all the sins

479
00:32:08,492 --> 00:32:12,620
That only God and perhaps the four of these know about!

480
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,370
Go!

481
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,121
I have

482
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:31,869
A fair idea about what you want to say, but pray tell,

483
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:34,689
What's the news?

484
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,368
He's said it today

485
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:41,039
That she's not the Farah who used to write him letters.

486
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,271
Who is she, then?

487
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:46,521
Well, you'd tell me about that later.

488
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,875
Pray tell, my dear,

489
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,278
Do I beg forgiveness

490
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:54,529
On his behalf,

491
00:32:54,529 --> 00:32:56,512
Or ask his mother to?

492
00:32:56,512 --> 00:32:59,698
You're embarrassing us, Uncle...

493
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,206
My dear, if it's embarrassing to you,

494
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:06,178
Alright,

495
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:09,424
I'll humour both of us to guard our esteem.

496
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:12,632
The truth, my dear,

497
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:17,146
Is that I am firm with regard to my honour,

498
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:20,266
And I'm fully aware

499
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:24,347
That a child is a benefaction from God.

500
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:28,532
But, my dear,

501
00:33:28,532 --> 00:33:31,082
I lack the courage

502
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:35,723
To return such a benefaction to God in my lifetime.

503
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:39,351
He's my only son, so naturally, I'm afraid

504
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,207
Swept away by emotion,

505
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:44,458
He may take a wrong step,

506
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,958
Or perhaps leave me.

507
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:49,913
That is why

508
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:53,244
I usually talk in such a manner

509
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,691
Before him

510
00:33:55,691 --> 00:34:00,010
As I used to before my Dad.

511
00:34:00,881 --> 00:34:01,575
Thus,

512
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:05,760
All I have said to him before you

513
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,008
Has been, by this standard, rather too harsh.

514
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,119
Yes -- I know...

515
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,933
Now that the truth has come out, it pains me so much to think

516
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:22,408
Of all the cates we couldn't relish that day.

517
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:23,954
All of you

518
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,145
Must've prepared

519
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:27,827
Some real delicacies!

520
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,637
I'll invite you again sometime.

521
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,433
We'll prepare the same delicacies again.

522
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,841
No, my dear,

523
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:38,263
When a man fears embarrassment,

524
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:41,221
He no longer feels hunger.

525
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:43,620
Now, how would I be...

526
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,053
I'll go and see; he may have bolted the door from inside.

527
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:53,858
There!

528
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,849
He's bolted the door from inside.

529
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:58,880
Check --
-What --

530
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,861
Afzal!

531
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:02,548
Yes, Dad?

532
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,084
You're offering your prayers, aren't you?

533
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:09,332
I will in a moment, Dad!

534
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,597
He'll offer his prayers.

535
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:13,424
You'll see,

536
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:18,319
God will forgive him the moment he prays.

537
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:23,321
Please, my dear, forgive him.

538
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,454
Listen!

539
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,978
What did you do there?

540
00:37:24,928 --> 00:37:29,129
She's proven that she's not the Farah who writes letters to Afzal.

541
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:31,617
So that's some other Farah?

542
00:37:31,997 --> 00:37:33,233
So it seems.

543
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,136
Why was he head over heels for our Farah, then?

544
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:36,816
There.

545
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:39,719
That's the one secret that couldn't be demystified.

546
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,446
Nor could one understand

547
00:37:41,446 --> 00:37:45,134
Why the sight of Farah brought him to tears.

548
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:46,248
Nonetheless,

549
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:49,634
The truth has been made crystal clear.

550
00:37:50,202 --> 00:37:52,145
What's this in your hands?

551
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,198
I don't know.

552
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:54,921
Perhaps a shawl, a suit,

553
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,438
Or cloth for a suit.

554
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:59,448
Molvi Sahab said that Farah had come to his house for the first time,

555
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:01,604
So she must not leave empty-handed.

556
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:03,824
The unfortunate Molvi Sahab.

557
00:38:04,355 --> 00:38:07,169
He's unfortunate too,

558
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:10,000
But one can only feel his helplessness,

559
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,795
And not understand it.

560
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:13,567
I hope she didn't show her fury there.

561
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:14,789
Not at all, Mum!

562
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:16,928
She was shaking like a leaf.

563
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,657
And, given the kind of family his is,

564
00:38:18,657 --> 00:38:22,929
Nobody would dare show a hint of fury before them!

565
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:24,888
They only know love,

566
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,247
And it is with their affection that they can kill.

567
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:29,791
May I go now?

568
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,394
I need to ask her, too,

569
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:34,394
Why she teared up when leaving.

570
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:38,128
At least I know

571
00:38:38,128 --> 00:38:41,499
That Afzal is the only spoilt one in the family.

572
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,502
I told you,

573
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:44,983
There's one secret that has been left to be demystified.

574
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:48,199
One's mind says he's not noble,

575
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,922
But one's heart cannot agree to it.

576
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,200
